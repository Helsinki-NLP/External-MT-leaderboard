Parliament fails to approve Tymošenko's release
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected the proposal to abolish in the framework of the amendment of the Criminal Code paragraph, on the basis of which opposition leader Julija Tymoshenko was condemned.
The amendment, which would open the way to the liberation of the prisoner ex-Premier, was rejected in the second reading of the proposal to mitigate the penalties for economic crimes.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for allegedly disadvantaged agreement with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not valid, the appeal of the convicted is scheduled to be examined by the court in December.
Timoshenko calls the judgment a political revenge of the regime, suspicion of the occupation of the court caused the trial also in the West.
The proposal to withdraw from the Criminal Code paragraph 365, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 voters.
There were 226 votes needed to approve it.
Libyan victory
The story of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, has already its defeats.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him is after the war.
It remains to define the winner.
As it is a habit in the region, Islamists will win the elections, but it’s about whether moderation or radical.
The Transitional National Council has signed up to the Sharia law and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the stolen hands are cut off.
Women can forget the emancipation, the possible dismissal from faith awaits execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unite the Quran.
There will be an order in Libya that we can’t imagine and that we’t want.
But our way of life is neither the only nor the objectively best, and it would probably not fit for the change for the just mentioned Libyans.
In fact, it’s surprising that Islamic fighters took thanksgiving from the help of unbelievers dogs.
The excuse is only that, from their point of view, it was not a general from America who led the NATO airstrikes, but Allah, whose greatness they celebrated at every successful intervention.
So when the winners are searched in Libya, the West is not among them.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians, in the person of a dictator, dismissed the political ally without guaranteeing any profit.
After recent bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militaryly occupy Libya.
This leads to the problem with the expulsion of the “crossers”.
Will the oil companies have black gold in Libya without occupation?
It may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to pride in the unselfish protection of human rights.
If this is not the case, the lawmakers of the Sharia will not be able to do so.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in search of investors.
The statistical fall overthrew Europe on Tuesday.
The individual countries have published GDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy stagnated between quarters, Germany and France are growing.
The bond market is now breaking records.
Investors no longer look only to Italy, but also to Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary economic developments for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
Both countries at the same time adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany side by side better than expected (a 0.3% growth instead of the original 0.1%), while France said it appeared in a mild decline of 0.1% (original data talked about stagnation).
The Czech economy in the third quarter of this year increased by 1.5 percent.
Interquarterly, however, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated and, according to the CSU, it confirmed the trend of gradually slowing the growth of the performance of the economy.
The results are worse than analysts estimate.
The most important events:
The Czech economy in the third quarter of this year increased by 1.5 per cent, but stagnated between the quarter.
The German economy in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonal data, grew by 0.5 percent.
Eurozone and the European Union’s economic growth between July and September compared to the previous quarter increased by 0.2 percent, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 per cent over the year.
The revenue on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The revenues of Italian and Spanish bonds are rising to critical boundaries.
The problems begin to be felt in Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The revenues of Czech 10-year bonds remain below 4%, although the situation in the region is worsening.
Germany says the ECB should be the last instance creditors.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
They won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrate the progress for 200 million.
The football team has managed the hardest task of the season.
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Czech and the beautiful goal of Petra Jiráčka won 1:0.
Czech football, even with a lot of luck in the second half, has a luxurious advance from the domestic revenge and will not be missing at the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz watched the progressive match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a large portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the domestic break in the final, the great Czech and the hero Jiráček won in Montenegro happily 1:0 and celebrates the progress to the European Championship.
Because of the precise defence of the Czech whole, the Chernobyl team was under pressure in the second half.
The smolers of the match became Damjanovich with Vučinić, who burned two great chances.
And thanks to the great Peter Cech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, with a reward of approximately 200 million crowns added to the domestic football cash.
A lot of football has been played since the beginning.
Both teams were hard to engage in the combination and played mainly around the half-line.
The pressure of domestic footballers also did not come in the first half, long purchases for defense in fact the Czech defense precisely turned away.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
A living shield.
Hundreds of college students have created a live shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
They want to express their support to their country’s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed in front of the facility on Tuesday afternoon and then proclaimed the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students from the Iranian University of Isfahan on Tuesday created a live shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center where uranium is processed.
They show that they are ready to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in its recent report stated that Iran did not cease to seek nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on Iran's nuclear facility is discussed in Israel.
Students prayed in the afternoon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then proclaimed the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at shrinking the Iranian nuclear program as much as possible, the Israeli press said, in addition to the Isfahan Center, the target would be the facility in Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Obese child’s dining: not breakfast and dinner uzeniny
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 years of age have overweight problems, with overweight 9 percent of schoolchildren and obese 5 percent of children.
Obese children often come from families with unhealthy lifestyle, according to a recent survey.
It again shows how important it is for the healthy development of a person the environment in which he grows, and the patterns he is surrounded by.
For example, on the tables of obese children, upset appear up to half more frequently than in families of normal-weight children.
Frogs had to dinner a day before the research associated with an awareness event called Obesity is not an accident of more than 19 percent of obese.
It is also not a habit to play sports in the family of thick children, but it affects most families of today’s schoolchildren – only 15 percent of children answered that their parents at least once a week will find time for active movement.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and involved 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the activity Obesity is not a coincidence, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
More than 12,000 students from 4th to 8th classes have participated in the project.
The proper nutrition and sufficient family movement are one of the determining factors that cause a dramatically increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the respondents, for example, said they ate five times a day in the breakfast-sweat- lunch-sweat-dinner regime, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition," one of the results of the survey said.
Without breakfast and dinner
Experts point out that the relative details are essential for healthy development, including the regular time of family breakfast.
Only 23% of schoolchildren eat breakfast at the same time.
Everyone is eating breakfast alone.
And the worst was the finding that in ten households there is no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, unhealthy grapes are consumed much more frequently.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet limonades every day (70 percent).
More than 40 percent of the children surveyed regularly sports, but their parents were less than half - 15 percent.
Create your diet.
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own dietary options according to their own taste and opinion.
“The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from the ideal in terms of healthy nutrition.”
Among their favourite dishes there are a lot of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
“Alarming is especially the great popularity of sweet lemonades,” the final report to the survey states.
For lunch as the main meal, pasta wins just above the poultry.
But the kids did not want a lot of butterflies and the popularity of fish and lunch vegetables was low.
Approach to health
The study also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
“In the control group of the survey participants who filled the questionnaire after the conclusion of the lighting lecture Obesity is not an accident, there has been a significant shift of preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition in a number of cases,” the project’s results say.
This was significant, for example, in the sweet limonade, where more children would begin to prefer ordinary water.
Children also much more often marked in the questionnaire poultry and fish as the main food of the day and would limit sweet foods and knedles.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, professors say
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I was so a little complaining that there was a lot of that already at the introductory hours.
I didn’t know what was going to follow.
Lectures of three professionals from the field, clothing of problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes to the place.
And it will be worse.
The closer the final exam, the more information and practical tasks awaits us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it’s really “blind.”
This time we discussed with director Alenka (there is no single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who has no perfectly proportional character.
That is the majority of them.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boy figure without proper curves, and someone overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically smooth the wide shoulders, extend the neck or provide the necessary curves.
We got tips, as for a woman like Jennifer Lopez, thus a larger chest and bounds and a narrow pas, the character well to emphasize and at the same time the woman not to dress too challenging.
If, for example, the difference between the pas and the sides is that the pants or pants really don’t fit, then it’s worth to let you wear at least one such piece on a custom.
You will definitely not regret, because perfectly falling clothes are unpaid.
In a suit you will feel much better than in a one that constantly moves you, stretches you, stands in the pas and so on.
The boy figure can afford to wear clothes with scratching, applications, clothes, or clothes.
Of course, there are a lot of such information and characters, so I’m glad I have a whole week to get all the information in my head.
And I am afraid that because of the domestic task it is up to.
Each of the cursists has been awarded a celebrity to invent two outfits: day and evening.
We need to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the personality and the type of character.
I’m going to “wear” Miranda Kerra, maybe you know her from the Victoria’s Secret campaign.
In the spirit I’m glad, for me personally definitely better than such Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained a hundred pounds ( please consider exaggeration), or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut out clothes from magazines or search on the internet and print and then graphically process.
The Moodboard, as it is said to the whole result, then expresses our personal style and the relationship to the graphic representation.
Thinking about the graphic page of styling is also important.
The stylist does not only wear physically, but also creates the so-called product pages in magazines (for specific assignments, for example, trends of the pocket, jackets, etc.).
This was told by designer and stylist Mario Kameník.
But only on Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview.
The Saturday lecture filled with information about the types of characters was sprinkled by three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Humble, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a smart stylist can work with one piece of clothes differently.
Variability is key in this case.
So, for example, such a trench (or if you want the original trenchcoat) can be worn classically through jeans and triko as a coat, but you can wear it on a naked body, wear boats and photograph as a dress.
Or it’s enough to wrap the armbands or limes and immediately the whole look looks differently.
“Play with it,” he emphasized.
But I most appreciated the following advice: "To work you need to know the rules perfectly."
“Then you can start breaking them,” said Jacob.
Finally, it’s clear to me why we get all those lessons, what to combine with, what to, why, when even in fashion magazines we see something different.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that the stylist must have prepared much more variants of clothes than how many of them go to photograph.
So for a fashion story that will have ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be ready to "stay" at least fifteen.
And also that on the photo clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces of leckdy completely different than in reality.
This is what we need to consider when creating outfits.
That image and style makes leckdy up to half of success, Honza Humble confirmed.
Just look at Madonna, who is not a miraculous singer, but image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the access to the services of stylists is rather cold.
Even the faces that I know are unnecessary (it is enough that I know something, the way I look at it is secondary).
And if someone already let us create a styling, then we have to count on the fact that it is very likely to give us a completely different (smaller) size than it really has.
Then it’s only to googled and find out if the bulvar didn’t write about that celebrity stood/zhubla and so on.
Honza and Mario on Sunday placed us on the heart that the stylist is not enough to orient in fashion and know how to make an outfit.
In his work, he communicates with the people he wears, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to submit themselves, to stand for their own opinion.
“When you are ordered by a manager to climb her closet and add it a nice piece, you can’t throw her out the whole closet and say, God, it’s a terrible thing.”
"Find there at least a few things that you will praise and recommend what they can be wearing," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what everything must contain the so-called "payback", or a plate bag.
It is the one that you turn around your passport and you have all the properties you need.
In addition to bright things such as footwear, hair rolls or closing spindles, there is also a silon nit (with it the stylist helps in photographing products such as pockets or hates), special clips to pick up the back of the clothes if it is bigger (spindles or other swords are not permissible, they would ruin the clothes), or a shirt.
To not just listen, but also try something practically, we learned how to fit the shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the surface is straight, the drainage could be damaged, even outside.
So we climbed and climbed.
The shoes should not be touched, so that they will not be damaged.
There is really a need for skill.
Mario praised me when he praised my creation without reservations.
That skill is not my friend.
This is just a little bit of what we heard about the second weekend course continuation.
It begins to be more and more clear to me that engaging in styling at a professional level isn’t really a walk in a pink set, no matter who wants what he wants.
Need for Speed: The Run is running across America.
Review
Originally, careless driving, due to a series of completely unnecessary laidake errors, turns into a routine morning journey on the shell.
The ambition has been achieved to a great extent, but it is nothing valid when no one obviously wanted to do anything extra.
The new episode with the subtitle The Run raised high expectations before the release.
He promised that the yearly racing series Need for Speed again will move a bit in a new direction and from the playable shows it appeared as a game that would not have to be just in the genre of action racing.
We were also curious about how the inserted passages will fall, in which the main hero will go out of the car and take on his own.
As in the NFS series it is a habit, many results are a little different than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole draws down a few unnecessary mistakes that appear in the series more than a few years ago.
So it’s actually not a mistake, but rather a manifestation of some uncomprehensible leness of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are listed in the story whose protagonist Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution it is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You will sit behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to arrive first to New York.
The idea brings with it several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race goes on a different track and the given stages are placed in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don’t feel like the game is always the same.
Some of the environments are also very nice to look, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
This is nothing worldwide.
But riding across the desert, autumn landscape or high in snowed mountains is visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are from time to time sprinkled with some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you get into a sand storm, which significantly decreases the visibility.
On the contrary, in the mountains again you need to be careful so that you are not drowned by the lavina.
In addition, the different races are well performed.
There are only a few types, but it is enough.
For a moment, you try to overcome the desired number of opponents (in essence a classic race), then you get time (a classic match with the stickers) and then you are waiting for a duel with a single opponent.
It is also a time to time for the police to get involved, which further discomforts your efforts.
The new is the passages outside the car.
It’s rather just such an interactive animation, when Jack mostly escapes from someone and you have to help him in doing so that in the right moments you print the right buttons.
Nothing complicated.
It will be surprising, however, that these passages are much less in the game than you would expect (especially even just three).
As a result, it is in favour of the thing, because this element has no chance to become annoying, and in the context of the above, it is so ranked to the elements that spread the game.
The driving model goes in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that it is definitely no longer known, but it cannot be said that it would be a negative.
If you’re looking for a realistic simulation, you’ll have to look elsewhere.
But more action-conscious racing here’s driving model fits still quite well, although we could find better at the competition.
Until then everything is perfectly okay.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the motorcycle model, the motorcycle model is no longer good.
From the game of this type we don’t expect it to count complex deformations and collisions, but when practically before any collision into any object you don’t have the smallest idea how your car will beined, then probably isn’t all okay.
Typically, when you get closely ahead or pass the cars in normal traffic, you sometimes only slightly fold each other, but other times in a almost identical situation your car will end in wild piruets.
Or even directly.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn’t really bother you, but it will break you reliably.
Restartes are resolved in such a way that if you break down or go far out of the track, the game will throw you back to the last catch point on the track.
There are only five rebounds available in each race.
When you get out of them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
It is, therefore, rather such a help for the case that something does not succeed, than that you could expressly rely on them.
But sometimes even restarts will not help, they will be solved by the need to learn the given part of the race to remember.
The big disadvantage of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curtains, for example, need to go in a specific way, otherwise you won’t get into them.
Other times you will meet on a given place “civil” cars always in the same configuration whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
It is especially angry in situations where you see the opponent between the two contrary cars before you easily pass, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to circumvent them or brake them.
It doesn’t matter when you get to them, because it’s “calculated” so that the situation always occurs right before your nose.
The competitors have another advantage.
Thro the time of playing you will encounter several places where you, again regardless of the time, will always be ahead of the same opponent in the same place.
Most of it dirty at the end of the game on a long bridge, where you go in the opposite direction.
The opponent must come there before you obviously for any price.
When it goes ahead of you, it makes you worse the overview of the contrary cars, so you start there about a couple of times.
You can understand the intention to make the game more stressful and adrenaline, but the performance is so obvious that it will reliably quickly disappoint you.
And it’s a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and places even so actionful that sometimes you literally don’t watch where it flies.
And it’s essentially no matter whether it’s worth a concept with fifty unique trails, ranging the races so that tired doesn’t have a chance, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the exchange of cars during races.
You have to pay attention to the petrol pumps on the road, because there you can change the car, although in the vast majority of cases you will get enough with what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Athletes are suitable for urban areas, strong American buses on straight highways and exotic super sports for technical riding, for example, on clocked mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand and the challenge mode, which is the races in the individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points into your profile, which is common for challenges and the story.
To get a higher driver level, various items are opened: starting with cars and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
It is also connected to the Autolog online feature, which, among other things, compares your achieved results with other players and obtains additional community features.
One of the other difficult to understand is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you get to the tunnel of the metro (budiž), where you marry it in the dark on the rails (budiž).
On the tachometer, the numbers are blinking between 150 and 200 km/h (budiž) and a set of the subway is attached to you from the back and uncompromisely shrows you.
In the edition, we will still have a few days of discussion about whether at the creation of the game really no one even a little thought about, or whether the authors have us as really so big fools.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in a few cases even great.
It freezes so that in some more exhausted moments the recording decreases, and in some cases quite tragically.
This applies, however, primarily to the buracks with a greater number of participants, when the smooth drawing is no longer valid.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an attempt to enjoy the wider scale of a younger audience, a soundtrack from the category "every dog is different" was created, but it can be assumed that because of the listening to music, the game will not be purchased.
Need for Speed: The Run is a great deal.
If the game avoided completely unnecessary errors, then we’t be afraid to say that The Run is the best piece of NFS in the past few years.
This is how the game does not work.
Fun is definitely good, but prepare yourself for the fact that the mistakes will throw you into the eyes by the power of airport reflectors.
The UK singing group will sound at the Students Samet concert
The combination of the celebrations of the International Student Day and the anniversary of the Samet Revolution with the musical experience offers the Festa Academica festival for the third time.
During the course, he will be presented to twenty high school and high school singing corps.
The main focus of the festival is two concerts held on November 17.
"The University of Karlova has a large part of the festival."
“Most of the participants are the Pedagogical Faculty and the Faculty of Humanities, the festival committee will be held by the rector Václav Hampl,” said organizational team leader Jakub Čaloun.
The peak of the entire festival is the public free-to-access concert of the high school churches, which will take place on November 17th from 14 p.m. on the premises in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the programme is the song of the prominent Czech jazzman Karla Růžičky Celebration Jazz Mass.
In the evening, a concert "Students of Samet" will be held in the ceremonial spaces of the National House on the Vinohrade, on which the university churches including the singing churches of the University of Karlovy will perform.
Festa Academica aims not only to honorably celebrate the International Student Day and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Samet Revolution, but also to present to the public the coral music at the highest level and to develop the creative collaboration of young people.
The main organizer is the Union of Czech singing chorus in cooperation with the Jan Kepler Gymnasium.
Over the whole event took the support of the mayor of the capital of Prague Bohuslav Svoboda and the rector of the University of Karlovy Václav Hampl.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
The schedule, in addition to ceremonial concerts, also offers a wide range of musical meetings, student happening, matiné and other shows.
Detailed information can be found on the festival’s website www.festaacademica.cz
Ambassador to the EU Vicen:
Czechs have a reputation of negativists and euroskeptics
“The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly disrupted the balance between the institutions.”
“I didn’t expect it to be such a hard war.”
“It will take five, six years before the situation is a bit stable, calm and before all players get used to their new roles,” Milena Vicen, a Czech ambassador to the European Union, began a lecture at the Law School.
How seriously she takes her motto “Comprehensibly and openly about Europe,” she showed in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the individual EU bodies and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that a number of lecturers from the UK Law School could envy her.
Vicen also praised the work of the new permanent chairman of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
“First, there was a criticism that he was unmarkable, that he was a gray officer, that he could not play any role, and I must say that everyone was breathing out, that he got the role well.”
“He is a man who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go.”
The new post was explained by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as a response to the question: "Who is the European Union? to which telephone number should I call?", that is, as a significant step towards the unification and greater readability of the EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to prohibit me.
Vicen also focused on the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The Czech presidency was a success.
The Czechs addressed the upcoming financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis or organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time then described as a great negative, which greatly damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is very busy at the moment.
According to the ambassador, "fact frmol" was not only the presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that is being addressed until today.
Furthermore, the new seven-year budget of the Union has to be approved, which is significantly complicated due to the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be thin and economical, which sectors will be preferred, which countries will be supported more and which less, all this is on the agenda of the next talks.
The ambassador also reminded her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "About Europe clearly."
“I really don’t like ugly shortcuts, strange words, a handy that no one understands.
“How does the citizen understand that there are really no curved or round corns in Brussels, bananas of different sizes, or that someone really has to prohibit the corn.”
It also wants to better exploit the EU environment and get more Czechs to the European institutions.
Multi-speed Europe
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation of euroskeptics and people who notice the negative rather than the positive sides of the thing.
It also affects the low representation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault is a lot of factors, such as the humility of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also the low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
Believe me that when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches, the French next to me will say, “Hey, what do you meet there, what do your Visegrad Four?”
In the future, the Union, according to Vicen, is predicting mainly new hard rules for the budget policies of the Member States.
As a very real, he sees the concept of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, rather than a new “European Federation.”
“There are countries in the eurozone and countries outside the eurozone.”
“We have a Schengen space, we have an institution of enhanced cooperation.”
“For the first time it was said that only the countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t want to stand away.”
“These institutions will be more and it will be a strongly two-speed Europe,” Vicen expects.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all issues that have an impact on the whole Union should be discussed among all Member States, not only among the Eurozone countries.
The Brand Story:
IBM Innovator Begins the Second Century of Its Existence
If someone was looking for a word that would most accurately express IBM’s strategy, the closest would probably be “long term”.
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of a technological revolution, it is a company seen as very contemporary, and yet it has been a hundred years since its establishment.
The foundation of this long-term was placed by the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already raised the motto that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His motto “Think!” became the footprint around which the life of the future giant will take place (and also the name of the internal magazine, which in IBM began to be published in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson’s carefully built corporate culture.
“For us from IBM, long-term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained faithful to its basic values and was not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second hundred we can even more,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, current CEO of the company.
developed system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the care of his employees similarly to the entrepreneur Baťa in the Czech Republic - people from IBM had as one of the first American employees paid leave, employer insurance plus elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system for rewarding the best inventors and merchants.
IBM has a long-term customer relationship.
The company was from the beginning genius in the extraction of talent – as one of the world’s first companies, it eliminated any discrimination so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategies, the current plan is that Palmisana, led by IBM, will replace a woman - Virginia Rometty next year.
She has been in IBM for thirty years and still holds the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has made so-called caves, online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations arise.
It is not surprising that there are enough ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institutions with a Good Name
The firm has a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM had a concept of institution rather than just a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor of Harvard Business School and author of the book about IBM.
“IBM is not a technology firm, but a company that helps solve business problems by using technology,” said George Colony, a consulting firm for Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, the difference is between entering the market and creating the market directly.
IBM - or "Great Blue", as it is familiarly referred to because of its logo in the United States - has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a hundred years.
It is apparently the most versatile technology firm – it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of all U.S. technology companies and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include a bankomat, a credit card, a financial swap, a barcode or a discet.
With about $220 billion, IBM became the second-largest technology company in terms of market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft since 1996.
Looking forward
Not all products and innovations hit the taste of customers and the time - for example, IBM did not bet on its own OS/2, the online service Prodigy or IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is built on moving forward, you can’t be emotionally bound to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms – and when they don’t work, then leave them.
Unlike the competitive Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective Technology
IBM’s sales are the largest of services, about a fifth of which is software and hardware.
In 1990 he was the strongest hardware representative with more than half of the share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets worth $15 billion, during the same period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the new financial crisis was overwhelmed for the first time.
IBM acts according to the reference of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investments during the major economic crisis.
Until now, it seems that IBM is experiencing the current crisis untouched.
IBM’s stock price has risen by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, and the net profit of the company continues to grow.
IBM’s corporate password is to change everything, but not its values.
Therefore, we can expect that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will manage it.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Flights to Space
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, originally had the complex name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over until 1924 – originally it was a brand used for subsidiaries in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later IBM gave the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
They owned technologies such as famous "pipe machines," i.e. hours recording employees' arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chairman of the company’s supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of the competitive company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The leader then concealed the founder of IBM – on Watson’s ideas is built the unbeatable corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of machinery for business - from meat and cheese cutting machines to cash.
During the first four years of Watson’s headquarters, the turnover has doubled to nine million dollars and the company has started its extensive expansion to all continents.
Watson was so unnecessary to the company that after almost forty years in the chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, humans and computers from IBM helped NASA control flights to space - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic “peach” that established the computer standard of that time, called IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the contrary, it bought the consultancy part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to dedicate itself fully to high added value consultancy and services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for over the past three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, “smartest planets.”
It aims to smart use of technology in even unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example, in transport and city management.
For the area of trade, IBM recently introduced the “Smarter Commerce” platform, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
She founded its branch in then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a centre for strategic outsourcing in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a world-class research team engaged in voice recognition.
The Unfaithful Husband:
I don’t want it anymore, I don’t want it anymore!
Rihanna (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtara (53) became not only the protector of Ivety Bartoš (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph will wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now she has no intention to wait and has set clear rules for the next life.
“Pepa can go home, but no longer as my partner,” Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtář gave asylum to Bartoš in her home this summer, she probably didn’t even think how her marriage would end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved from Greece after 30 days, Pepa didn’t leave the singer.
He even admitted publicly that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, reconciled with her husband’s relationship, and now even gave him forever goodbye.
He doesn’t care with whom his wife is sleeping.
If Rychtár and Bartošova had only split once, the open hand of his wife would not wait for him at home.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will expel him.”
"He will survive him not as my beloved, missing old bear, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," Rychtář said, with the fact that she has already retreated from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
Joseph's fact that Darina had closed his back door was not concerned.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
“I’m going to be with Iveta and I’m not going to change it.”
“My wife has established a paper marriage and I respect it.”
“The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy.”
“With Darina we’re having fun completely normal, just that we don’t share the beds together,” Blesku Rychtář said.
If Rihanna also found a new love, she will not be defending it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, and if he has a friend.
I know that’s my fault, I’m in love with Iveta and I take all my responsibility,” Joseph concluded.
The worst women’s bad habits: Do they affect you too?
When you’re asking men if they’d be able to mention some typical female bad habits, they’re usually all in one very fast out of the handheld.
Dear women, do you know yourself in the following lines, where there are several female bad habits that can make men perfectly pump blood in the veins?
Shopping
Does your second half blame you that you’re addicted to shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one handheld a week?
Do you like to shop in a lot of discounts?
Then in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that their shopping passion should be at least a bit shrinking.
But tell me who would resist it just so to walk through clothing stores, look for well-falling shots and then try them all (ideally in different colour designs) in the cabin?
Although shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a finished hell for men.
Remember how many times you have said to yours, let him wait before the entrance.
Continuous dissatisfaction
“I’m not too fat?”
"I need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
“I like you at all?”
Do these phrases remind you something?
that yes?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with how they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of this complaint increases, the more annoying women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It’s like an infinite wing.
Washing windows, drying, thinning plates, dust cleaning, drilling the bath - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for sliding the dirty legs on a clean plate, the children for sliding the drawn washing machine, and the glass living wall, with which you have done so much work?
If you’re suffering from this “chickness”, try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and purity should definitely not be the first place within the family.
This harmless desire for purity can threaten both your relationships and family well-being.
Rhythm
“You use the trains to throw into the basket.”
“Will you wear your old socks tomorrow?”
“The soft handheld does not belong to the ground.”
If you take this way to your partner several times a day, know that you can put it out reliably.
Of course, you don’t think it’s wrong, you want to get it all right.
Maybe if the men knew it, the women’t have to go so much into them.
Drawing, Drawing
For some women, they are also owned by deceit, scams, but also insults and associations against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, and so together they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
I hope each of us will get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
It’s a hand on the heart, it’s a hand on the heart for all women.
On the contrary, they are the thickest grains, which love and often thick, possibly disregard everyone and are dangerous for their surroundings – especially within the framework of the female labor group.
JAGR and Voráček assisted to win Philadelphia
Hockey attacker Jaromír Jágr took part in the NHL Monday match with two assists on the Philadelphia 5:3 victory on the Carolina ice and is again the leader of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
Thirty-nine-year-old star's overview was gained in both cases by Claude Giroux, who added another record and was proclaimed the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the match was recorded by Jagr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
After the match, Jagr told foreign journalists that he predicted a big evening for Giroux.
"I told him before the match that he would give a hattrick."
“I felt it.”
"Sometimes you'll feel like this," Jagr explained, after which Giroux gave a goal from the first Flyers shot.
A while later, the team had a Czech track.
The Voráček beat the Hurricanes goal and presented it between the circles to the score Maximo Talbot.
A second before the first break was weakened by domestic player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to Flyers.
Especially for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágre he shot the third goal, then his shot turned into the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
“I love to play with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely among the best three," Jagr said.
“I would never think that at the end of my career I’ll be playing with a hockey player like him.”
“I am pleased with it.”
“I want to play on him.”
“All those years in the NHL, my colleagues tried to play against me, now it’s going back,” Jagr added.
Carolina from the match still made the drama, the goal of Tuom Ruut and again Dwyer, who made himself out of a criminal shooting, got the difference of one goal.
But another complication was not allowed by Matt Read, who ended the numbering two to one.
“He played greatly in our Pronger band.”
“The coat was swallowed, I took the speed and (Read) went to the distant wing.”
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad that it came out," he described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia won the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defense player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček did not play a match against Buffalo, in the second quarter he resigned due to injury in the upper part of the body.
Candiens, in addition to the experienced beka, lost the two-band leadership and lost after a penalty shot 2:3.
One of their attacks did not change Tomáš Plekanec.
Instead of losing points, the home coach was regretted by an extensive back line, playing the match only for five defenders.
“It is bad.”
"We played only with one experienced player, the rest were young people."
“But we can’t do anything with it, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
"The shift for the shift was on us and we couldn't resist."
“We had to simplify the game, move the puppy out of our band.”
We had a gap in it,” added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions to a 5:2 win over Tampou Bay.
The goals of Jets, which broke the five-match series of losses, were divided by five different shooters.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time sold in the vast majority only trips to the countries of the socialist block, since travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists then traveled for a holiday to the sea to the NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on Crimea near the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime approached the West and the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of socialism was that the citizens of the socialist block (i.e. the Czechoslovak) were not allowed to travel individually freely even within the socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a call letter from this country, otherwise the individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to stand the front overnight with a sleeper or have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
However, it was not won either.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was the condition for travel to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a foreign exchange promise it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for the journey to the West.
The most frequently, however, the Czechs spent their holidays in the country, which resulted in a large number of chats and chalets that the Czechs purchased and this habit survives to the present day.
The travel of the Czechs has experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 holiday in the NDR or Bulgaria was our maximum, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
The enormous paradox that we don’t realize today is that it was not possible to travel freely to the most popular Croatia for us until 1989, since it was part of the Yugoslavia at the time.
At the end of the 1990s, the visa obligation to neighboring Western European countries was abolished, which initiated a huge wave of short-term visits primarily to Austrian Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovak people could not take a long trip to the West, everyone wanted to see at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, the Czechs' trips slept in parks in tents, as our earnings at that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a pension.
A typical feature of traveling the Czechs was at this time driving their own food, conserve, salads, etc., to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely exchanged Czech crown, thus our tourists could finally after many decades freely buy the Western currency.
However, our living standards and the average wages have increased, resulting around 1997 in another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have started regularly preparing charter airlines since 1997, making air travel unbelievably slower due to the possibility of contracting quantitative discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had already a visa-free contact to almost all the developed countries of the world, except the United States, which continued to make our travel easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution travel occurred in the year 2000, when the first direct charter flight to the exotic was made from the Czech Republic due to a large demand, it was to Thailand.
From this year so every year they fly with Czech tourists direct charters to warm distant countries, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic already to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolution development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. canceled the visa for Czech tourists and thus our country was definitely ranked among the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50,3%) and for the first time in history spent for one foreign holiday including costs at the place of residence more than 15 thousand CZK per person.
The general assembly has to find a chairman, but it is threatened again.
Nearly five months the Czech football has been without the chairman and it is threatened that the successor of Ivan Haška in the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on which electoral procedure to be implemented.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest in leading the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June and when he left, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the epoch after Hashk, football crushed back to the patches between the two coalition chambers, which cannot agree on the common candidate.
It was on the 16th of September, when the new president was elected.
The delegates of the general assembly sat unnecessarily to the National House in Prague on Smíchov, because the talks remained blocked and it was not just a way of election.
There has not been any agreement on who has the right to vote in the assembly—whether only statutory representatives, or even full-power officials.
In this single point since then there has been a partial agreement, which has also helped the recommendation of the Constitution for the State and the law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
There are controversies on the electoral system.
The executive committee has not made it too clear to the situation, which in its talks, whether ordinary or extraordinary, does not solve in essence anything else.
The view on the possibility of the election has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to move forward in the 3rd round to exclude the possibility of a pet?
"The dispute is whether to move in accordance with the statutes, or to find a different model," said one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR, Dušan Svoboda, who in the leadership of the association represents professional football.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate who will have a greater percentage of support in the Chamber for which he is candidate will win.
Morava is allegedly willing to go to the withdrawal to win a candidate who gets a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech party promotes the condition that the winner must obtain at least two-thirds of superiority in this percentage count.
"But it would then lose the meaning of the two previous rounds, it would completely deny the two-room concept," he understands the objections of the Moravian Party of Freedom, according to which it would be the best order not to move and vote according to the current statutes.
Tomáš Paclík is somewhat surprisingly agree with this, although it is estimated that the statutory electoral order meets the most of all candidates to Pelt.
“I wish that the votes will be made in accordance with the legislation.”
"To not invent some representative foolishness as at the previous general meeting," said the owner of Victoria Plzeň, who is candidate for the first time and in his statements defined himself primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburk, he said the new president will be known and believes that the candidates will collaborate constructively in the future.
"All the passion will calm the possible progress of today's national team to the European Championship."
“Football again will be on a happy wave, there will be greater willingness to cooperate,” says Apple official, who has the greatest experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more resilient.
“I hope in an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very broken.”
“It’s not between the people of Czech and Moravia, but there are efforts to target the regulations.”
"This can cause the blocking of the general assembly to happen again."
"I hope, however, that a healthy reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is no longer a lot of time to agree.
Some talks were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete.
The air special, in which they had to travel to Podgorica among other vice-president Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, namely from Prague due to a technical failure, did not fly in the morning and was looking for a replacement variant, how part of the executive committee to transport to the place of barage revenge.
It is possible that there will be a decisive meeting at the ministerial level, which may be held on Wednesday.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Bodybuilding Josef Dobeš would like to encourage the split parties within the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot in the game: state grants, the trustworthiness of football and the planned general gathering of the CSTV, which will address the new direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Mr Paclík is fighting for the president because he doesn’t see the right candidate.
If the chief of footballers Plzno Tomáš Paclík saw a strong candidate before an extraordinary general meeting, who would meet all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not enter the struggle for the top office.
“If a good adept exists, I’m fighting for him and I don’t go to the election.”
"But in the current situation, no one has been able to find such one," said CCC Paclík.
In the battle with Miroslav Pelt and Jindřich Rajchl, Paclík is motivated to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favorites of the elections, in the way to lead the FAČR.
Mr Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory he would remain in the role of chairman only until 2013, when a regular general meeting is on the agenda.
In the position, he would look forward to seeing an experienced and top manager who is not too connected to football events.
"With some people who would come into consideration, I talked."
“It was crazy for me when some said they don’t even want to identify with the Czech football at the moment.”
“I want to change this point of view,” he said.
Paclíkovi is now most concerned with the Pelt's connection with the President of the Plzeňsk district football union Roman Berber, a man with a controversial reputation, who is known in the background as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates at the general meeting.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík that Pelta stands in the presidential position.
“If he wins, the current state is preserved and nothing would move forward in football.”
"In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a talented trader, this would not benefit football even more," Paclík said.
It also shows that the name of Pelt years ago appeared in the latter during the investigation of the corruption case, but Pelta came out without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And how would we also look in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," Paclík said, who also takes overlooking his former statement that he would "sold the Plzeň club if Pelta became president."
If Paclík triumphed in Thursday's election, he would be able to imagine a future cooperation with Pelt.
The same is considered by another candidate Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended with a fiasco.
“He (Pelta) would be the first I would follow.”
“He has great abilities.”
“I could imagine him as the chief of the team.”
“But managing the association could not.”
"I also don't stretch my nose where I don't know," said Paclík, who in September raised great attention by standing behind the appeal of the arbitration commission led by Luďk Macela, which was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
He said he would be troubled by the association.
He refers to his capabilities from the management of private firms, since last summer he has also chaired Plzni, which with his support in May celebrated the Premier League triumph.
“I have the power to change something in the football environment to contribute to its cultivation.”
“To limit the influences of some interest groups, which may have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and appeal committee, which treats up to unpleasant situations,” Paclík said, noting his antipathies, for example, to the Spartan chief Daniel Kretinsky.
As one of the priorities he would also consider the strengthening of the relations of the FAČR with the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby at the political top for the sport to get more money from the lottery tax.
“This is one of the key things that the new president should deal with.”
“If gambling is taxed, as the political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they have to say where the money goes,” he said.
As a burden now Paclík does not even take its connection with the Plzeň club, although he himself claims that the chairman of the FAČR should be "supersonal".
Pelta is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague Dukla.
“It’s not ideal.”
“I don’t see any sense in the fact that I’m hypocritically transferring my shares to someone in the Plzeň club and in a year and a half he returned there,” Paclík said.
Pelta promises new FAČR statutes that would exclude election pat
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that in the event of the election, the FAČR will have new statutes that would definitively exclude disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic before the meeting on Thursday in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election struggle will significantly undermine the possible success of the football team today.
Pelta has already promised before the September unrealised election that it is about to focus on representation and funding in case of election.
He decided to go to the last minute to the election before the last general assembly, so he could have a two-month delay to defend and present his ideas about football management in a broader context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday.”
"He feels it's the highest time for someone to lead the association," says a man who is linked primarily to the Apple Club, but who has been in Sparta and the executive committee of the association for many years.
He also believes that he has enough experience to be able to drive the Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is the euforia that ruled during the time of the rule of Ivan Haška.
"Unfortunately, in the June general assembly, statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they don't allow different interpretations, we've had a chairman since September," Pelta said.
It was the re-working of the most important document of the civil association that he understood as a point of view for the delegates.
“If I become a chairman, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take a personal responsibility if it fails.”
“It’s a fundamental thing that we can’t be without,” says Pelta.
He continues to try not to fight against his opponents.
He has previously announced that he can imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, who he recognizes because of his legal education, and he knows well that his counter-candidate would be his first vice president.
For a long time he didn’t attack even Tomáš Paclík, who, on the contrary, didn’t leave the nit dry on Pelt.
"He has been in football for more than a year and has already achieved some success."
"But his attacks were unworthy and a lot of people jumped out in a way of electoral campaign."
"And therefore many of them are now doubting about his real character," he said to the opponent's address Pelta, who said he remains faithful to the claims he announced in September.
His strongest weapon is, according to him, the knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the representation.
This should be the explanation box of football.
"And I would also try to end all affairs, starting with the cause of the Bohemians or the hearings of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately go to negotiations with the private and public sector to ensure enough money for the whole football," the 46-year-old candidate said two months ago.
He also promised that his arrival to the head of football would not mean any staff cleansing.
"I have to get acquainted with the filling of the individual employees first," he told Strahov, where from the long unheld there is a understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the planned general meeting, they believe that delegates will not go to Nymburg unnecessarily on Thursday.
"If the only controversial point is how it will be voted in the third round, we will be able to pass through it."
“Football needs credibility, and it will only get it by finally having its leader again,” Pelta remains an optimist two days before the possible decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that under him the FAČR will begin to work hard
If the former Deputy President Jindřich Rajchl was elected to be the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic on Thursday's general meeting, many people in the association would say it would not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that in the event of his election he will begin to work hard.
He wants to implement systemic changes and make the executive committee members responsible for the individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money to football and to continue the work started by former president Ivan Hašek.
“As a president, I would like to play football as a whole.”
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football to youth.”
“I don’t say that I’m doing everything by myself,” Rajchl said in an interview with CTK.
“I’m a team player and I want to divide competences in the executive committee so that each member is dedicated to certain areas.”
“And I’m going to give hard tasks to move football a mile ahead in each segment.”
“Many people’t be delighted because it would start working really hard and not just criticize the work of others,” he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he thought he would not be elected again.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I won't have people behind me who will constantly throw my klack under my feet and challenge every step," he explained why he hesitated.
“But many people told me I should not give up, because then others would give up.”
“It’s a trust that I can’t just throw away,” he said.
He is also motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Hašk.
"These two years have been a lot of work done and I don't want to throw it down now."
“There are initiated processes that will be heard in just a few years, and I don’t want someone to stop them,” he said with concerns that in the event of the election of another candidate Miroslav Pelty, the situation in the union could return to the time before Hašek.
“I believe in systematicity, and that’s what Mirek Pelta doesn’t know.”
“There are people behind him that would make football so that it would be only for the elected.”
"I can be guilty of a lot of things, but not that someone's side."
“I try to be objective.”
“I want to play football for all because then everyone will be well and not just the elected,” Rajchl said.
He also said he would be a Czech president.
“While some people are trying to say the opposite, I plan to do my best for Moravia.”
“For example, it’s time to consider that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravia part, whose winners would go to the first league.”
"There would not be the current situation when there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem towards the young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Since the chairman of the Plzeň club, Tomáš Paclík, has been involved in the struggle for the president, Rajchl does not hesitate to estimate his chances of election.
"I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as its vice president and sees that there are clear achievements behind me," Rajchl said, who considers its achievements as saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating the lottery law.
On the contrary, it gives itself the fault that the bond does not stretch for one thread.
While Pelt claims that he is "disqualified from returning confidence to the Czech football," Paclík considers the other to be a strong candidate, who has what to offer to the football.
"No one can doubt that he has done a great job in Plzni for that year."
"If he was elected, he would continue in the matters that Ivan Hašek started here and would not fundamentally change the staff in the committees."
“He’t want to put it in his own favor,” Rajchl’s rival assesses.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
jump to blue
Julia Stanek
Browsing from the perspective of Ufona, a swimming pool in Budapest: Whoever travels through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after touring the cities or traveling let his tired legs rest in the thermal baths.
The book will show where wellness is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder travelled in the past one and a half years on the journey of discovery, it was not allowed to be missed in her luggage: her swimming clothes.
Leaving a sign on the water, she looked up to the height of the artisticly shaped cabbage, swimming in front of the marble pudding (a little naked boy, a child (with wings) waiting for her on the edge of the pool, and admired the carefully restored secesion floors.
If she liked some swimming pool, she brought it into her notebook - even with remarkable details about the construction method and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by the architectural historian Meder and now presents them in her newly published book "Badefreuden (The Pleasure of Swimming) ": People's swimming pools in Munich, the historic palace of swimming pools in Schwarzwald,"The Hard Core of Beton Buildings" in Taurus.
13 countries led her "The Journey to the Most Extraordinary Baths in Central Europe": Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a genuine enthusiast of swimming culture.
With sport it doesn't exaggerate much, says Meder - only in the water it's something different.
To anger is only that the fan swimming must be satisfied with the blue cracks and the odor of chlorine, while runners for health can breathe the omamly smell of smoke forests or listen to the joyful flaming of birds in the park.
“One day I wondered why the swimming pools must always be so harsh,” says Mrs. Meder, who lives in Vienna.
“So I started gathering beautiful swimming pools.”
Water level doubles architecture
Sleeping in the jumping pool and essential oils for the sauna - the well-being factor is therefore so large that it concerns all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the swimming pools could be a real pastry for the eyes: "Instead of the floor, a man has a water level in the baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: a high clay, a variety of clay, a jumping plate.
The Maloformate Picture Pack "Badefreuden" provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historic oasis wellnes - but it excites but above all the taste of jumping into the blue.
The remarkable examples were discovered by Mrs. Meder during her search in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent medicinal baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi baths in Budapest, she found water containing nitrates in the original Kras cave (Miskolc-Tapolca Jaskin Baths) and thermal baths, whose swimming pools are filled with alkaline water and are placed in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
A wonderful view on the contrary are offered by many heated swimming pools under the open sky in Switzerland and Austria. While a man has a whole city from the curyscreen swimming pool in the eyes, the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton can look at the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam swimming pools there is a window from which it is possible to watch the tourism on the ski routes.
Per the most remarkable design of the pool awaits the spa guests in Längenfeld: Ötztal Aquapark looks like a ufo that just landed in the Alps.
From the three up-open pans in the winter, the steam rises, while on the background of the Ötztal mountain it turns to heaven.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every swimming pool, the swimming pool collector Mrs. Meder smelled chlorine into flu.
Many thermal baths are felt after sulfur, in the Baths of Árpád in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells after heating oil to the extent that one will hardly believe that he got into the therapeutic baths.
The smell comes from medicinal water with the content of alkaline hydrogen carbonates, which is almost black and whose settlements fall on the skin as soon as a person slides into the pool - a somewhat special wellness experience.
But also one place was Iris Meder disappointed in her search for beautiful baths: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate baths of Luhačovice, she met on a closed ground.
In 1902, the bathroom designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovich was closed.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the broken windows of the red-white-yellow secesion buildings, she saw how massively the grass grows between the plates.
The disappearance was faced in the magical swimming pool in Schwarzwald: in the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These baths have already three stages of construction; one can discover not only the Novoroman elements that come from the time of its establishment in 1844, but also the Maurian Hall in the style of Alhambra, which was connected around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995 the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bathroom place of the swimming pool expert Mrs. Iris Meder, and not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's already some performance to combine so diverse building styles into such a wonderful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
In such a palace, immersion in a thermal swimming pool is apparently a marginal matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank to check goods trade
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned the working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the head of the group will find out the consequences.
Hamburg –
For federal citizens, it is clear: 84% of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn, according to one study.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to withdraw from the trade because the problem of the world’s poorest is deepening.
This is the result of the Forsa survey by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on the report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges throw prices up and banks thus bring co-win on the world’s problem of hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically targeted against the head of the Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, although big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley do the same.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to ensure traders against price fluctuations.
Meanwhile, however, the majority of experts agree that capital market participants with interest in high-risk transactions were dismissed from supply and demand – and at the expense of the poorest achieved profits.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised that the excuses will be checked and said that no trade "will not be worth the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank being given in the bet".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the International Working Group is monitoring outcomes from the Foodwatch Report.
By the end of the year, the control is to be closed, then the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of the Deutsche Bank - along with a recommendation on how to be charged with it.
At the end of January, the bank will announce the results.
At the end could be a reduction in the trade of commodities or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann works self-help on his image.
The head of Foodwatch, Thilo Bode, welcomed the report, but at the same time strengthened his criticism of the financial sector: “The betting on the rising food prices shows drastically how unrighteously banks today harm the general well-being.”
Let Ackermann be the highest bank lobbyist.
"Deutsche Bank must cut out of its portfolio all items for which money is used to bet on food prices," Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter whether Mr. Ackermann is about hungry people or Deutsche Bank’s reputation.”
Ackermann's insight appears to be surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the group would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before leaving office.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman, other than planned, will not go to the supervisory board.
By discarding the controversial agricultural speculation, it could improve its image.
And about possible losses he doesn't need to worry - with this he should eventually advise his successor.
Each second would declare the investment in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Institute Forsa on 7 and 8 November asked 1001 people.
Just 11 percent according to this consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments associated with food prices.
Many bank customers would also make personal consequences if they learned that their bank is taking part in such transactions: each other would, as a result of the survey, declare all investments for which money flows into raw materials speculations.
43 per cent would warn acquaintances before such a bank, 49 per cent said they were thinking about deleting their account and going to another institution.
House of the 21st Century in Vienna
Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with heights, falls and happy ends: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and disappeared.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
When heated for modern post-war architecture, for bright shapes, glass halls, brave breaks and new building materials that are typical for the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition 1958 is an exquisite and famous example.
The Schwanzer pavilion was then awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and profitable steel and glass structure.
The building is considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He celebrated the architect so that he also built the pavilion of Austria for the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-wheeled BMW Palace plus as a key made by the side building in Munich, it eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
Its as a temporary exhibition building projected pavilion after the world exhibition was placed in the Schweizer Garten near the Vienna Südbahnhof (Southern Station), reconstructed and in 1962 opened the Museum of the 20th Century - was named as "House of the 20th Century".
Suitable but for the museum building was not, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for the hanging of art exhibitions, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art came to a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has grown more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz pavilion has been reconstructed, now it is called "The House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as a Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening there will open the Museum of Belvedere, to which the palace belongs, the first exhibition - a happy intention in every way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted art historian with a distinctive career, among other things in the youth of a crocodile, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founder director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, promoted strongly the reconstruction of politicians and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruby should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a cafe and a bookstore should be created, and an office building should be built for this.
Strict supervision, low budget.
At that time, Krischanitz was an ideal occupation.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand the secesion buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and won the competition, but also because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna at Schwanzer and the pavilion was for him a "extremely important place" where he " almost every weekend" saw the exhibitions.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when moved to Vienna and changed its use.
At the current reconstruction there were far greater problems: the building was a "catapult for energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, used by glass fiber strengthened insulation glass and the glass roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold bridges - steel bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and the ceilings filled with asbestos have been sanated.
Two subterranean floors provided a place for new use, the open lighting channel between the building and the street obtains lighting, the bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the standing Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance doors remained preserved, the building is painted in an ancient anti-corrosive red-green color tone.
The cinema is exactly the same as it was before.
And all this under the strict supervision of the Monument Office and a low budget.
"Sometimes it had to be found a material that is good and cheap and also liked the monument office," says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken floor of the underground.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and air-friendly.
It was hard to say that it was with the pavilion, "which came here from Brussels," said recently Krischanitz, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
Such architecture says it stands "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "build adequate self-confidence".
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in an inappropriate place, as a urban happiness has occurred: in the circle around the Schweizer Garten, a completely newly designed "City Quarter at the Main Station" is created with office and residential houses.
And maybe there’s another happy coincidence: the 21st Century House could receive support from another Krischanitz’s building, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as they hear, it’s already negotiating with the city for a neighborhood in the station in the Schweizer Garten.
The Trail Plans a Million Dollar Package for the Winter Crisis
The railway has drawn up a crisis plan to prevent train failures in the winter season.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It will cost millions.
In the fight against the winter caused by train disruptions and delays, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The “Bild” newspaper presented a preliminary report with reference to the internal group plan that it is estimated to have a total investment of around 300 million euros by 2015.
It is intended to help improve the use of trains and railway networks also under extreme weather conditions.
It is planned, among other things, to double the number of internal and external employees per 16,000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and subway stations.
The objective is to get rid of the ground until the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary shifts within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of roads Rüdiger Grube warned after meeting at the highest level with government and industry representatives of train disruptions and delays also during this winter.
In the last winter season, the trail had significant problems in passenger transport because, among other things, in difficult weather conditions, it had a lack of reserves.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Authority for years.
In addition, there is a delay in ICE trains.
The train has not been able to do so for years, and ICE trains are likely to be more frequently checked at the ICE train at the main station in Cologne when the trains were destroyed.
Deutsche Bank to pay a million penalty in the US
After the shock around chairman Joseph Ackermann, there is a new trampot in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of compensation there.
As if the Deutsche Bank had not yet enough problems at home, the industry’s work in the U.S. has been traced by its past: the Frankfurt Institution has paid $145 million (106 million euros) in one settlement procedure to resolve disputes due to the bankruptcy of five major co-banks during the financial crisis.
It is the sale of mortgage cards.
The regulator of the financial market NCUA accuses a number of large banks of deceiving co-operative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that the risks are likely to be reduced.
Such papers lost significantly on value during the crisis and drove the banks with them into a gap.
“We are pleased that we could solve the issue without the parties having to go to court,” a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York said.
The bank does not acknowledge any guilt.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the welfare of both monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for co-operative banks in the U.S. and helps in bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is trying to get compensation for the billion damage caused.
Now completed balances are the first of its kind.
The regulator also applied to other big banks and in the summer charged JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
These are the so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
They are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble collapsed in 2007, it became fatal to a number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed their mindset.
Although the events occurred a few years ago, a sharp wind is now blowing out to the banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits in order to obtain corrections or affect errors.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
He claims to 18 international big banks that two U.S. state financers who deal with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s real estate in a $200 billion mortgage deal have disadvantaged.
Also, the Deutsche Bank has to face the FHFA claim, here it is a number of transactions in a total value of approximately $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires that the Frankfurt Institute be liable for "significant losses" without indicating any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and stated that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett gets $10 billion to IBM
Buffett’s financial guru invests greatly in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, it has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the major American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he will not invest in IT and computer, because the long-term development of companies will only be left with difficulties to predict.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s business reports and changed his opinion about investment in the industry.
Much earlier he had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and acquires computer systems for IT departments of other.
Warren Buffett’s investment in the financial world is considered to pass on the Knight.
As a result, it can now be called IBM’s IT motherstone “Sir IBM”.
Buffett told the U.S. Economic Broadcasting Agency (CNBC) that he has purchased IBM’s shares for $10.7 billion since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM did not know anything about his involvement.
He praised the management, who sought in the economic crisis even for good revenue.
“You’ve done a great job,” Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has long been beting on lucrative IT services such as operating computer centers.
More than 100 years of computer pioneer also offers software and advice and powerful computers for.
Buffett has avoided technological companies to the present day.
He claims that he only invests in companies whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett sought the cargo railway, the lubricant manufacturer or the machinery products.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway, in addition to about 80 own subsidiaries, also owns shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Municher Rück.
The 81-year-old man took over the 1960s the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and built it with wise investments one of the most valuable in the world.
However, his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of earning money brought him the surname "Oracle of Omaha" (The Miracle of Omaha).
When Buffett’s investment became known, IBM’s shares rose by one percent before the stock exchange was launched.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, has a total price of more than $220 billion on the exchange and is considered, together with Apple and Microsoft, the most valuable technology companies in the world.
In Microsoft, so many Buffett would not want to go on.
Bill Gates is his confidential friend.
The threat is tangible.
After the "Cell in Zwickau" was revealed, Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
The newspapers even talk about a “bloody ideology” which is now reviving again.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek in the years 2000-2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
The report was reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For for many German Turks this returns the horror, which has long been considered dead: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has not been any comparable violence with the right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany has never been doubtful.
The discovery of the right-wing extremist network, however, reveals the scope, the dimension of which has long been unseen.
“Is it a revival of a bloody ideology?” the headlines of the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper “Haberturk” sounded.
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the contrary, emphasizes that one of the offenders should be a secret police officer of the constitutional protection department and fears that the German authorities may also be involved in the right-wing radicals.
The Turkish community reacted cautiously: Germany remembered the weekend with a silent demonstration in front of the Brandenburg Gate of the victims of racist violence.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In joyful colors, a joint life was inscenated - as a history of success.
As a box here works the news of several Turkish media: "The Gift of Germany to the Fifty" is the title of the article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, the release of the newspaper "Hürriyet" for Germany cannot be taken, not to make this thought connection.
“It begins to swallow,” the title of the column is from Ahmeta Külahci.
He emphasizes that people who paid taxes and their work contributed significantly to the restoration of Germany were murdered.
The most critical is discussed in German-Turkish internet forums the police procedure and its late success in search.
Why did the German authorities not think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
So many are presented at least retorically ready to use drastic means: "If this activity is continued to be carried out so superficially, immigrants will have nothing but their own defence and weapons."
It will be the best self-defense.”
“On the quality of clarification and the proportionality of punishment of the entire network, the internal peace in Germany is very strongly dependent,” Selen writes.
What does it mean if the internal peace in Germany is threatened, clarify the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photographs of the burning site in Solingen are deeply thrown into the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has shown to the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that uncertainty and deviation can lead to right-wing violence.
However, the attacks have made the Turkish side feel more visible.
Do not repeat past mistakes
The Turkish press at that time was primarily criticized by the failure of German politics after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the fire attack in Solingen he sent a compassion telegram to the Turkish state president, but he left himself to represent his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the Cologne's sadness ceremony - Kinkel then in his speech calculated what fees the Turks were delivering.
It is as if the value of a person is measured by the amount of his tax.
The current news of the Turkish media once again shows how deep is the uncertainty of many German Turks in the state-law arrangement here.
In addition to the efforts to enlarge and re-evaluate the extreme-right terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Scandal Bank at the Lake Curry
The most adventurous bank in Europe has its headquarters not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered under the financial crisis almost bankruptcy and has since slept from one crisis to another.
It is a German to compare.
That’s what Axel Weber didn’t think.
After his loud withdrawal from the head of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that he will enter 2013 into a almost equally spectacular new job: the chairman of the Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber was pleased publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and said friendly comments to future colleagues.
“Die UBS has reached a turnover.”
“I’m looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.”
But in September it was clear that everything would be completely different.
One dealer from the UBS in London overturned all the security systems of the bank and waste about €1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, not only a recognized Switzerland bankier, had to leave.
The President of the UBS Board has since been as well as overwhelmed - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber banks may be advised since February 2012.
And the chairman of the board will take over in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It will be hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an emission banker, and he would need time to work.
It will then take responsibility for the strategy of the bank, which just once again proved that it deserves the title "Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe"
Because UBS is, on the one hand, enormous – until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world – and slows, on the other hand, for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, so it seems, will not remain a proud Swiss bank saved.
It started with the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS an excellent reputation.
The image of a silent and solid, but also intelligent asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
Thus, UBS 2007 managed on the one hand with $1.6 trillion more money of rich customers than any other bank in the world.
As an investment bank, she joined the world’s largest banks.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former bankier and later long-standing professor of banking in Zurich, tells us: “I always put UBS as a model for a good bank to my students at that time.”
From today’s perspective, man asks himself, “How could I just be so wrong?”
He mistaken greatly.
In 2007 it was clear for the first time that something in UBS was wrong.
In the middle of the year, the executive chairman Peter Wuffli, who has so far been considered to be a highly intelligent and also genius bankier, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, he realized why he left.
The bank’s investment division lost the Subprime-papers and had to withdraw billions.
In order to stop this, UBS announced a capital increase of really 13 billion francs.
That’s why she really found investors, but those on whom she’t even bear the nose: the untransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and the Arab state fund, which was so discreet that one could not even know its name.
But it was just the first blow.
In April 2008 it was worse.
The bank had to admit new billion losses, the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second best-paid board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster followed: UBS stood due to its wrong investments under the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
Nationalbank bought UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, while the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on obligations for which it could become the co-ownership of the bank.
The whole Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it was for a small country when it had so large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times the performance of the Switzerland economy (see picture).
"We could not save UBS again," says bank expert Geiger.
The first catastrophe follows the second.
For a few months, UBS has surrendered in a tax dispute with America and has demonstrated its willingness to issue the data of rich customers who, if possible, with the help of banks, cut taxes.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return of unlawful profits from these transactions including a fine fee.
This made UBS more or less openly aware that it helped reduce taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: a sacred candle of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same as before.
It followed the resignation of the chairman and the chairman of the board.
The exodus of customers’ money.
Thus, the bank has lost its credibility within a few months in both central business areas: in investment banking due to poor speculation and in asset management to help reduce taxes.
And just when it got a little calm, just when it was thought that UBS has recovered again, this unhappy trade anabase comes: The only dealer lost €1.7 billion before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And it’s clear: with the risk management in investment banking it’s probably not yet fit.
"The case of Adoboli probably found that the risk control changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and finance professor at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
Also, the financial director of the big German bank is sure: "The problem with UBS is that it fails to control the risk."
But this was precisely the idea of the caution with which Swiss bankers went long ago to become the guards of the world’s great assets: no too big risks, therefore security for money – also from this side the Alpine Republic again collapsed the world.
Swiss bank treasures have become a symbol of untouchable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fit to the cliche of a good Swiss private bank - it’s just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in the Curish Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curish Lake, which is rooted by the snowed heights of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are wonderful, the rental stores are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery such as Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional stores such as Sprüngli.
For centuries there have been Swiss banks: from the Nationalbank through the Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall enters with heavy rotating doors.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front of them stand a massive leather chair, next to the logo of the bank a large direction to the "seef".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
The Switzerland banks, both Switzerland’s big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have sometimes suppressed or betrayed this idea, as the head of a small Switzerland private bank finds.
His name would rather not want to be read in the newspapers, he eventually concludes, like all Swiss bankers, also with both big banks.
UBS is probably too bigger, it finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglosas have also expanded.
The Switzerland has nothing to say about it.
"And if so, they adapted long to the Anglo-Saxon ways."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that UBS changed, bringing it first high profits and then disaster: No European financial institution lost in the jungle around Subprime as much money as the Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was evident.
“On that Wednesday, a government coalition of a small seven-million country resolved on the biggest rescue action in the history of its nation,” writes author Lukas Hässig in his book “Der UBS-Crash.”
Up to 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billion euros, were approved by politicians to save the standing big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that have happened?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you see the problem primarily in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks joined a massive group.
The bank was formed, which had already been too big to the small Switzerland at the time of the merger – and continued to grow.
At the same time, the two different bank predecessors of UBS were complemented: a rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a heavy place in asset management and a poor, but internationally more engaged.
Suddenly internationalized investment bankers came advantageously to a lot of money with which they could turn a big roulette.
With this UBS rise, two names are associated: Peter Wuffli, head of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
“I’ve always thought Wuffli and Ospel are the team of the future,” says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, humble, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, a man controlling the feelings around the stomach, who has developed from banking science completely up."
But Ospel said he relied on Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "Maybe he thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
“This is a tragic case.”
It is tragic, probably.
The pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the leaders’ meetings, on which the group’s chief Wuffli repeated the same motto again and again: “Strack Goldman Sachs from the throne down.”
The U.S. Bank was the world’s most powerful investment bank.
She mentioned the "League Tables", an agenda that documented the success of the banks of that time.
In that, UBS tried to place it completely upward.
A few steps have succeeded.
In the exchange and stock trade, the game took part completely up.
However, the business advisors who were commissioned emphasize one weakness: In international interest trade, in the speech of the "Fixed Income" bankers, there is probably a big gap behind the largest banks.
UBS has some gap in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS decided to take an adventure that almost cost her existence.
The hungry after growth, invested both the bank itself and its founded fund to secure risks in U.S. Subprime investments.
It developed into a powerful machine that packed securities over to U.S. mortgage loans and passed further – while it also retained the risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, there UBS bought," says bank expert Geiger.
How big the euphoria is, so deep the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were harder than thought.
The positions at UBS have become a catapulting seat and so far are houped.
Whoever leads a big bank now has almost unbearable work.
They have to find a strategy for the bank that all close business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: End with investment banking, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
So far the bank does not want to go.
But the investment banking has to decline strongly, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, will present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was actually understood only as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated with its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, it has been promoted: It has to long-term run UBS shops, the Curish bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state in the mid-1990s.
3500 seats are cut.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is her?
What does he want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber already asks.
He says he will find a house in Zurich with his wife.
next year.
The fear of a recession in Europe burns the U.S. stock exchange.

First of all, the financial values stood on the tickets of sale.

“We’re not an island but dependent,” said Steve Goldman from Goldman’s management.
Europe will probably not recover from the recession so quickly, in addition, there are other signs of bank weakness.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this prospect: He said in one CNBC-interview that it’s probably not yet clear if Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
That’s why it’s probably too early to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left a few decades old principle and entered the American technology industry.

Intelligent worms are spreading in cities
In many places, cattle are considered “problematic birds”: However, these highly intelligent animals have long been unable to be removed from cities, experts say.
Some love them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: the woods have been the image of the city for centuries, yet in some villages the complaints of the inhabitants about the dirt and noise caused by the animals are accumulated.
There is no “problem birds” yet in surveillance.
Havranes of the field may not be expelled from the cities, experts said at the first symposium on the woods in Eastern Lear.
Experts from all over the country have consulted on the possible outputs.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Conservers of nature have also brought the problems of cities out of the exodus of protected fields: the use of chemistry in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
The persecution, the growing construction and the cutting of typical trees to nursing birds make life more difficult.
Worms are protected.
Great colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are among others in Westphalia’s Soest, northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz, and Achim at Brem and in Lear.
There caused a 2005 controversial project of mass murder in the rural district negative titles.
Critics have described the catch of animals into bird traps and klack killings as brutal.
“Normal expulsion, frightening, nothing brings,” so much found by urbanist and landscapeist Werner Klöver from Lear.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting trees often has unwanted consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
“The animals go down, the great colonies break down and divide into other places.”
Fear is thought only as an exception for hospitals, pensioners’ homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we don’t get them away anymore.”
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Lear.
It is thoughtable to combine the expulsion of animals from sensitive residential areas and their inclination to settle in other places.
"Information tables instead of chain pills" was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of a completely different treatment of animals: "One corn in the face we can ultimately best stop self-confidence."
Mrs. Jürgens co-founded in the Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg Scientific Wrath path, on which information tables provide lessons about the life of a highly intelligent field wrath.
The project has already received tourists.
Also on criticism of the noise caused by birds, Mrs. Jürgens had her own opinion: "Here is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: the Havrani fields do not only use the help to reach the palm, but even make their tools as a help.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the behavior on four field crashes, how far the bird intelligence reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones must lead to the collapse of the structure in order to get to the larva of the mole.
Without a great training they realized what size and shape the stone must have to cause the collapse of the platform.
In the second attempt, the melted worms then had to solve a more slender problem.
In the vertically built wing, the researchers placed a small container with the larva of the mole.
The birds were unable to reach their hostage.
However, the researchers put pieces of wire there.
From them, all the four animals made a hole, with the help of which they caught a container from the tube for a hold.
Three of the four field havranes succeeded in this even with an intervention.
Cristiano Ronaldo to shoot Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for the Cup did not come out.
Favorite Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have won the last tickets for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-off matches.
Guided by the double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth in a row participation in the European Championship perfect after the score of 0:0 in the first match.
The Czechs were enough in the revenge of the Play-off with the outsider Black Mountain 1:0 (0:0), when the first match was a clear thing.
Croatia did not score 1-0 against Turkey, Ireland scored 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) gave more goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional from the Federal League Zvjezdan Misimovic converted penalty (41) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) dropped twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia has already disappointed in the play-off matches for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal arrived.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free shot from about 30 meters into the network.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his qualities in a large distance shooting and scored from 25 meters to 2-0.
The Bosnians, who did not do in the first half of the hour, had their first clear chance in the goalkeeper Edina Dzek.
The former player Wolfsburu from the English at the head of the standing club Manchester City set the ball on the bottom line, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
Finally, he stood in the center of arbitrator Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After the procedure against Helder Postig in the Bosnian Criminal Territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and granted the Portuguese a yellow card.
On the opposite side, Stark carried out a controversial criminal blow after the action of Fabio Coentraa, which Misimovic with certainty changed.
But after the break, the 2004 European Vice-President clarified everything with four hits.
Peter Jiracek ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
In 1976, the European Championship was held for the fifth time in a row.
The team of coach Michal Bilk with Bundesliga legionaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1 FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the initial stage.
Brancher Petr Cech prevented reflexively in the last moment possible own branches of Tomáše Sivoka (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest chances when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the turn from the border of the criminal territory just close to the Czechoslovak goal.
After the break, the border had to save the place of the already crashed Czech world-class goalkeeper, again reduced the attacker FC Soul (50).
Shortly before the conclusion, she finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost with certainty has to release his third place at the 2002 World Cup, Croatia may be pleased with its fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir's stadium, the Turks should experience almost a fairy tale start.
Selcuk Inan hit in the seventh minute with a shot from a distance only a stick, the attacker Kazim also couldn't hang the reflected ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, however, Croatia was increasingly controlled.
The Croats did not win after the break.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice from VfL Wolfsburg, who from the 62nd minute released the dortmund Ivan Perisice, the legionaries from the Federal League were Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni to the European Championship
In Dublin, Ireland celebrated its first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who cared for success 4-0 in the first match already on a preliminary decision, in the 32nd minute to lead.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57) ran for guests.
Ireland has set the pace from the beginning, but it had to wait until the 23th minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only in the last minute the Estonian defense prevented the potential leader.
In the 32nd minute it was far away.
After the failed defense of the goalkeeper Paul London, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to the 1:0 status.

Massacre at personal level
Peter Englund’s emotional new book “Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War” begins with a long list of emerging characters until you’ll get the head out of it.
One advice on how to keep yourself in that moment: Carefully remove this page and make it a tab.
With all the people you will know very well in Mr. Englund's novel story and this list will serve you as a navigation - like a kind of lighting - in the moments when just like men and women in the story you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book that we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite accurately, as a "antihistoric work".
It contains several very well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energy journalists and discussions about tactics and equipment.
It’s not even a book about what happened, the author explains, rather as a “book about what it was.” It mainly talks about “sentiments, impressions, experiences and moods.”
"Beauty and Sadness" combines the war experiences of 20 more less dozen men and women on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanics to mountains, doctors, rescue drivers and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others will become prisoners of war, lose ends, get crazy or die.
Their lives are melting like the flames of candles burned in the church – new ones are added to the fate, while others are shut down.
Mr. Englund’s book is different from classic historical novels.
It adheres to the idea that the First World War was just about terrible battle on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sadness" is a skillful exploration of other places where war dramas were carried out: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, the Mesopotamia, and East Africa.
Soldiers in this book address problems with the fact that the bees fall on them, have to spend Christmas in the shadow of pyramids or face the presence of the ce-tse mouth.
It was a very impressive reading from the very beginning.
The war will absorb the lives of people as a natural disaster, like the hurricane Katrina smells of fire dust.
When a shooting starts to sound in the distance and you are a woman who is at home with your children, you’ll escape or stay?
Who is actually approaching?
Almost no one understands what’s going on, even why the whole war was started.
“The vacuum arising from the lack of facts,” Mr. Englund noticed, “was filled with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
"Beauty and Sadness" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young naval serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are all taken from biographies, letters and other material already published.
The descriptions of their lives may sound scary and fascinating, but thanks to the inclusion of tiny moments and details, they are entirely vivid and credible.
Many of them talk about suffering and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "Honours, everywhere the substitutes."
“Coffee drawing, aluminum imitation, rubber imitation, paper bonds, wooden buttons.”
It goes further and describes the food replacement in Germany.
It is referred to as a "mass made of pressed rice cooked in skop fat (and supplemented with a false bone of wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato slopes, shoes with wooden shells."
He mentioned that there were "837 registered meat replacement in the production of parks and 511 registered coffee replacement."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American finds in himself internal incentives to wildness and brutality, and then declares war: “In the end you will understand that this is the human nature; not sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whisky, evening newspapers or a good book, and pretending that this your mask represents civilization, and that there is no barbar behind that scratched self inside.”
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he is likely to die soon and no one will even notice it, even to be sad.
"When one finally agrees to sacrifice himself, he would at least expect that this will happen in front of the eyes of a thankful audience," he writes.
Instead, however, he looks like “a judge he secretly hangs.”
Other comments relate to the departure of the old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
“The conflict increasingly became an economic competition and a competitive struggle,” says Mr. Englund, “a war between factories.”
He captured what he calls “the new kind of bestie of the coming century: an explicit and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a dress cut to peace, who performs his bloodshed without rising from the table.”
People behave completely unexpectedly, subjectivity changes with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some sexual illness from the prostitutes to avoid the service on the front.
“The most grotescent example of this behavior was the trading of gonococcus dust, which soldiers bought and combated their genitals in the hope that it would end in the hospital,” he writes.
“The most desperate people have seen him in their eyes, which often blinded them until the end of their lives.”
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s prose is smooth, but not so beautiful, which fits greatly to his human theme.
In dozens of small outcomes, he captures the way the war “disrupted absolutely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People begin to wonder why their leaders force them to fight.
The best books about the First World War mostly rather than with a comprehensive story worked with clues, such as "The First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novels like "On the Western Front Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers the unconventional concept.
His book has the most disturbing conclusions, which in popular scientific literature does not have an example.
I will not reveal it to you.
You will, however, feel like the author suddenly jumped out of the book, pulled you a page from the list of heroes out of your hand and burned it.
After the previous mistake this time for a minute accurately planned
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some in the helmets used in the streets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park was almost empty at that time.
No one knew about the action except a few high-ranking officers.The others were first told that it was an exercise.
The action was led by police commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
The cases of recent weeks have not been repeated, for example, when peppers spreads were used against the protesters, violating the rules of separation and, in addition, a wave of public sympathy has spread to the squatter side.
Therefore, the police operation, aimed at cleansing Zuccotti Park from the protesters, was started only after two weeks of careful planning and training.
The leaders were inspired by the operations that took place in other cities.
A massive exercise for the case of behavior in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island part, which was the preparation for an event in the Zuccotti Park.
The leaders have strengthened the so-called training for the oppression of rebellions – anti-terrorist measures involving the rapid move of a large number of police officers – with a focus on the city area of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "in the last moment" stated by someone to whom the action was originally explained only as "exercise".
"I know a few police officers who were also called to the event, and no one told them he was going to Zuccotti Park," the person said, who spoke only under the condition that he would remain anonymous.
"On going to Zuccotti Park, only the highest position members of the department knew."
One of the reasons for the secret was the lesson that the city once received.
On October 14th, the city officials had planned to clean up the park, but then they withdrew from the plan, because once the protesters heard about it, hundreds of them went to the park before the operation began.
The Tuesday action was attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from all over the surrounding area – dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that a large number of people come and leave in the park during the day, so one hour in the night was the ideal time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when there will be as few people as possible in the park," he said.
Before the units departed, they ran on the intersection of the Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive streets, near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplions.
The lights and the recorded news burning from the amplions scattered many protesters.
When members of the order units entered the park in their blue winds, many demonstrators packed their stuff and left.
Police said they did not touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m., thus they wanted to give the protesters time to pack their stuff.
Other teams of police were seen gathering on the edge of the park to get into it if any arrest was needed.
Journalists were forced to leave the park.
Police department spokesman Paul J. Browne said it was for their safety.
Many journalists, however, have the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing their units in action, and some police officers also behaved brutally with them.
Mr. Browne claimed that television cars on Church Street leading along the western border of the park could be captured without problems.
Police progressed in the western direction and flattered with a thick confusion of the protesters’ personal things, including luggage and igelit bags filled with clothes. Through them, teams from the hygiene department, who immediately gathered everything left in the park.
Some of the protesters who refused to move were pulled out of the park. Documenting images appeared a little later on the internet.
The most famous group of protesters fled near the kitchen in their camp near the center of the park.
Some of them created a shelter and the police began their methodological arrest.
Around 10 people in the center of the camp connected to each other.
And two men were bound to the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of the emergency services were called to cut down the locks.
Until 3:30 a.m. there was no arrest in the park, Mr. Kelly said.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr Browne said that approximately 142 people were detained in the park.
The majority of the arrests were due to "organization of persecution and resistance during the arrests," he explained.
The highest-level police officer at the site of the event was Joseph J. Esposito, the commander of the police department, the highest-level uniformed officer at the department.
The operation was also personally involved by Phil T. Pulaski, commander of the detectives at the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he did not participate in managing the operation," Mr. Browne said.
The second group of police were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, for the event that it would be necessary to call her.
On the Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on the Pine Street, a block south of the park, were lifted tracks.
From these places the police then developed the protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
On one place, police officers, many of whom were equipped with shields, were seen pushing persons further beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest event of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. in the morning, one demonstrator south of Pine Street was seen jumping out on the cap of a police car, and several others who pulled the air out of the police truck tires.
At a moment, a piece of clay came out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protestant were hospitalized.
A trade union of assistant workers will prosecute the city for release
Trade unions representing hundreds of school assistant workers who lost their jobs last month are planning to appeal the city on Wednesday. They claim that dismissal was not necessary and, in addition, it was a discrimination, due to the disproportionate impact on schools that are visited by poor students.
The Court of Appeal is probably the last option that remains to the district council 37 trade unions in their attempt to reverse the release decision.
On October 7th, six hundred and seventy two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees, who belonged to the worst paid employees of the city, lost their job. Their dismissal was described by the trade union leaders as a remuneration for the fact that they did not allow him to access the health care fund managed by the workchats last spring, with the help of which the city wanted to stick a hole in the budget.
The city officials categorically rejected the accusation.
At the City Council meeting last month, the Minister of Education Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissal was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the council members immediately checked by saying that there was no specific talk in the budget about the release of assistant workers.
District Council 37 representatives announced that they have already filled in the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they will appeal him. On Wednesday they will hold a press conference, where they will formally announce the appeal to the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The accused in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the prosecutor will be eight dismissed workers, all of whom are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said that the city has not seen the lawsuit yet, and therefore it will not speak to the individual accusations.
According to the New York Times complaint, the trade unions focused on the number of dismissed in the poor parts of the city, thus supporting their claims of unfair behavior.
They point out that while in the schools in the Staten Island part was not released at all and in the Upper East Side part only at least, in Brooklyn, in the District 23 part in Brownsville, 17 school assistants lost their jobs and in the District 8 and 9 part in South Bronx even 46 assistants were released.
He reminds that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, although it’s a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The appeal says: “It’s not a neighborhood full of mobile parents who can obtain funds to compensate for a budget deficit.”
The public school 36 budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year and the school also lost money as the city changed the way of calculating the bonus funds for each enrolled poor student.
The trade unions, among other things, claim that high school directors could be confused by the way in which a document approved the dismissal of parental coordinators was written.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the event, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more commonly used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school's salary to the database of available workers whose salary is paid by the central authority.
"Six-six parent co-ordinators were released," it states in the complaint, "and not just moved to the database on the position of available workers."
Mission is over, Congress is ready to agree on the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree on something about the Rebellion in Libya.
But before this happened, the revolution had to succeed, the long-time ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of the United States units was terminated.
On Tuesday, the Senate Commission for International Relations will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn), in which he should congratulate the Libyan people for their successful rebellion and thank the U.S. troops for their "state".
“Through this statement we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who have started rebuilding their country,” Kerry said.
“Both parties of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts.”
These sentences may seem innocent, but no debate concerning Libya has been easy until now.
During the summer, lawmakers from both sides were constantly discussing the text of a series of statements to approve or reject the U.S. military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution allowing limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House due to the differences between the two political parties, so it was never voted in the Senate.
However, on the same day that the proposal was rejected in the House of Representatives, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop financing U.S. operations in Libya.
Thus, the U.S. mission in Libya was literally in the legislative cleansing - Congress criticized the way President Obama manages the mission, but its members obviously did not irritate so much that they stopped supporting him in his actions.
The congress was eventually preceded by other events.
The rebels conquered Tripoli in August and Kaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate is now ready to act.
In its statement, the International Relations Commission congratulates the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable durability they have spent in the attempt to liberate their people and praises the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their allies who have engaged in the operation to protect the Libyan population for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.
The statement also “confirms the U.S. national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new proposal receive the full support of the Commission for international relations, or will the legislators be divided again into two half, as it was when the June proposal was approved?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (India), the head representative of the Republican Party in the Commission.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that the final version of the new proposal has not yet been seen.
The House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va), will be the first amendment to the Constitution concerning the budget or any other topic which will be voted by the whole House or the Senate.
Other legislators have not yet been able to push their proposals until the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of the 68 amendments to the Constitution that were presented in Congress and touched a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same — the same proposal submitted to the House and to the Senate — and others are only small changes to others.
Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of the balanced budget supplement and another few that would like to "regulate federal expenditure".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters – especially beginner Republicans, who want to improve their reputation – can proud of their “autority.”
The budget regulation report, which was approved in August, required the House and the Senate to vote on the balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding statement to support the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss the limitation of the number of periods in which members of the Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods in which he may be in the position of president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a series of additions that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
A permanent proposal remains the addition prohibiting the marriage of couples of the same sex and the addition prohibiting the burning of the state flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of states stand against them.
Although Congress members seem to be very active in proposing various amendments, however, they do not significantly disappear from the average compared to previous years.
In the 111th Congress they proposed 77 amendments, while in the 100th Congress they were 66.
Their activity even bleed compared to the early 90s of the 20th century, when according to the statistics of the Senate Library members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than the current politicians.
The last amendment, which was added - the 27th amendment - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
“Smelted, but not defeated,” Gifford says in her first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after she was wounded by a shooter at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz) appeared on Monday evening on national television, singing along with the melody of the broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and stating that more than returning to Congress is worth healing.
Giffords appeared in the show "20/20" at ABC News with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that making phrases still makes her trouble and she needed help when walking.
The whole program documented her difficult rehabilitation, which was necessary because of a wound caused by a bullet, which broke her head in front, penetrated the left half of her brain and came out of her head in the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to participate triumphally in the debt ceiling vote.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, the fourteen-year-old Giffords replied, “It’s pretty good.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the watch special of the program "20/20", which was broadcast in the evening of the release of the new book of this couple, entitled "Gabby: The Story of Courage and Hope".
The special monitored Gifford's entire rehabilitation since the January 8 shooting.
In the videos that Kelly filmed during the first weeks, Giffords is seen in a hospital bed with a scratched head and a long scratch across the forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can’t do more at that time than just raise one or two fingers.
A few months later, Giffords is captured by sitting in a wheelchair and therapists teach her how to perform simple activities.
Drawing the head.
Spraying the lips.
And then, her first word: “What.”
In a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "toast" when she demanded changes in her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show that the key role for the recovery of Giffords was played by music: Congressman on them sings together with a melodic therapist to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During an interview with Gifford, who has spent two hours of therapy a day, Sawyer said she didn’t remember anything from the day the shooting occurred.
Her husband said Gifford had read newspapers about the shooting until March 12, when she was first asked who she was the six who was killed in the incident.
The shooting suspect is Jared Lee Loughner, who is detained in a prison in Missouri, where under the influence of violent drugs he is waiting for a trial.
“A lot of people have died,” Giffords told Sawyer.
“Fastful, terrible, terrible.”
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at a moment his wife during the recovery stated: "I lost."
“So I immediately said to her, Gabby, you didn’t lose,” Kelly described.
“You have just got a charge.
But you’ll manage it, you’ll go together, and you’ll return even stronger than ever.”
Military units meet more with compassion than with respect.
The event was a gala night on Wall Street, which brought millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who have no roof above their heads.
Kid Rock singed a ballade about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and sailors flew around him.
A crowd dressed up and praised with enthusiasm.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring benefit.
The ceremonial evening was also attended by the then Chairman of the Committee of Chiefs of the Staff. In addition to him at the place was the Admiral Mike Mullen, who, however, saw the role of the military units a bit differently.
“Everyone was presented as some orphan,” the officer wrote in an email.
I am sure that the organizers thought well.
I know that yes.
But what I saw was not respect, it was regret.
So completely opposite impressions only illustrate the unleashed relationship between the army and often moderate, sometimes celebrating American public.
The army is filled with praise for its victims.
But this praise is worth something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if individuals in uniform are regreting.
“We’re not victims at all,” said brigade general Sean B. MacFarland, who commandered the troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us into the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive to military commanders who don’t want to look ungrateful or break their relationships with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops once returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most words of regret are spoken in silence and in privacy among war veterans.
When the two sons of the retired Colonel Mark Canciana returned from the battle events, where they served as members of the Navy, their father warned them that people outside the army would look at their service from two corners.
From the sight of some you will feel respect and surprise because they defeated the enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
But others will be wondering if "there is no evil, violent veteran hiding under the surface," Cancian said, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and took a place in Washington after returning to the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people who interviewed him indicated unseenly whether he could resist the stress associated with working in Washington so soon after returning to the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
The army’s concern is partly derived from American indifference to war.
Successes on the battlefield rarely gain recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army and finds little of its own benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer appreciate military heroism as it was usual during World War II,” said Colonel David Barno, who commandered the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition by politicians and the public focuses primarily on the suffering of men in the weapons.
The soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they suffered, the number of friends they lost, or for the scope of their injuries.
The army is facing increasing pressure to struggle against rape.
This week it will decide whether 28 women and men will be prosecuted against the army for alleged inactivity in case of rape.
If not, hundreds of other applicants are ready to appeal.
The first-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old in the night when she was allegedly raped by her army colleague and was in the 11th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008 and she headed to the castles at the Miramar air base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she met her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beer.
He asked her if she could join her, that they could drink a little at her room.
“In my head was a warning light,” Lyman said.
But the native Texasan completely ignored her objections.
I thought he was 19 years old.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
“I want to listen to my instincts.”
She claims that just a few minutes after they entered her room, the man passed to her, threw her to bed and rape her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other existing or former army members will wait for a judgment of a hearing that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will go on whether the accusations against former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will only get before the court.
The accusation states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the fight against the spread of rape in the army, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In the following months, however, their number increased to 28-25 women and three men, all claiming they were raped or otherwise sexually attacked by their colleagues in the army and that the army failed in investigation, punishment and any pursuit of justice after the announcement of these attacks.
Burke claims that he goes by the neck to the highest-established commanders of the army, because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a directive system,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in the position that can avoid attempts to introduce measures against such acts?
Burke also says she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could be part of further lawsuits in the future.
Her strategy: Instead of grouping all the accusations into this case – she puts all the eggs in one basket, as she says – she will file lawsuits in several different cases, if necessary, so that the pressure does not fall.
The defence team is led by U.S. Prosecutor Neil MacBride, who, together with his colleagues, has made an incentive to reject the case.
The trial documents obtained by Newsweek detailed the defence strategy - in principle it is about the fact that current or former soldiers cannot prosecute the army for the injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the 1950 Order of the Supreme Court called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries that soldiers in active service suffer.
“The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the prosecutors,” the document writes.
The Ministry of Defense refused to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in battle, it’s just a wording: in modern wars it’s hard to find a clearly given front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, women’s troops played an increasingly significant role, especially in the communication with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: between these wars fell 150 female soldiers – two-thirds of them directly in battle.
It is time for modernization to take place in the army, Burke explains.
He is not alone in his struggle; in addition to him, three other lawyers are dealing with the case.
At the Yale Law School, visitors to the Veteran Law Service Seminar are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for alleged development of an atmosphere that promotes hate to women.
This claim focuses on the diagnosis of a "personal disorder" allegedly found in victims of rape, so that the army has an excuse to release them - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati belonging to a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, this is a completely common practice.
The group has already filed a lawsuit against a state veteran negotiation organization in December, which it accuses of discriminatory practices to occur in the processing of aid applications by persons who claimed to have been sexually offended in service.
The Congress presented nine separate proposals, which were submitted by a group of Senators and Members of both political parties and proposed a series of corrective measures.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Resolution of Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defense, 3,158 sexual assaults were in 2010.
However, this type of attacks remains unregistered in most cases, and according to Pentagon’s own estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated number of 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
The report published in March also describes the degree of criminal prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases in the army came to court – half compared to the civil justice system.
In the case of Burke, the prosecutors describe the attacks only as the first of a series of trauma.
For example, the first-class soldier Lyman the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to occur.
During the night, she said, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape eleven times to different police members, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape and in her bed was found the blood of the attacker - from the wound she made on her arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman had a court hearing, during which questions were asked about whether she was in love with her friend on the day of the attack.
Six people were appealed, who, as witnesses, declared the reputation in favour of the alleged criminal, who was eventually released.
“I remember the day when the judgment was sentenced,” Lyman says.
“I had the feeling that I was going to be born right there – with a scream I ran out of the court room.”
"They placed me in the psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember I told my commander officer, 'This was not his court, it was my.'
Lyman ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, indicating her as unsuitable for service.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honor and therefore without the right to service.
Whether Lyman’s and other prosecutors’ case is moving to the next stage or not, it’s a run on a long track, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University of Law.
However, he notes, "from my point of view, they should be able to move forward to the next phases of discussion."
Between them and the verdict, however, stands the aforementioned doctrine, which was criticized from the first moment she saw the light of the world.
I am a lifelong critic of the Feres doctrine.
The army is a few decades behind, because their duties fail to observe the same level of motivational incentives and frightening means.
He adds: “Chances are hard against them... but it’s important for them to try it.”
Changes will happen only when good people are willing to fight.
Unless the hearing is decided in their favour, Burkevoá, the lawyer of the prosecutors, will gather hundreds of other persons ready to appeal and start working on further cases related to the subject.
“We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue, where there will be no reform,” he says.
Or until we die, according to what will come earlier.
Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Explore You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigration opinions on the internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who admitted to the July murder, after which 77 people were killed in Norway, took part in his first public trial.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was definitely not lonely in the cyber space: during the preparation of the attack he spent a lot of time on the computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just go out on Facebook.
“We realized that getting them isn’t really so difficult at all,” says Jamie Bartlett, the chief author of a recent British research team’s report on European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett, that it was enough for scientists to simply take advantage of advertising on the site and thus with absolute accuracy determine the demographic group they are looking for – something that marketing professionals have done for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups, focusing attention on them and sending them ads. However, instead of calling them to a newly created group or offering some dietary products through them, they invited them to fill out a questionnaire with questions about their level of education, their relationship with violence and optimism with regard to their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans from 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"This is a completely new way of conducting research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are all the young men who are suppressed by the growing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism even with off-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the computer screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one of the examples of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use this site to study everything, from health problems to social trends hiding with state updates, wall posts and the "Like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them daily will provide an average of three different data, making this social network literally a "information supernova", which stands behind the development of many new research. The number of academic works, in whose name the word Facebook appears, increased compared to the state five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook lies in giving them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"In the past it was true that when you wanted to do a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You should get into a party where you would never be left,” says Bartlett.
“This is all Facebook breaks down – you just go directly to them.”
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify a social-health problem and avoid them.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren from the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who broke their drunk outcomes on Facebook were much more threatened by the problem of alcoholism than students who silent about this topic.
Moren suggests that fellow students of the site monitor and come with an offer of help to a student who publishes too many drunk status.
“The problem cannot be solved unless you can diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle.
“We found a way to identify threatened children that we would otherwise have no chance to discover.”
Facebook is constantly investigating the data of its users.
The information team of the site has drawn up statistics regarding the context of relations status and Valentine's Day, the 2010 election participation and the coefficient of people's satisfaction (mainly using the information to which they had access - internet freedom defenders have long claimed that the site should make its information treasure available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the page follows them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, they need the page to provide their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don’t even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules regarding how to collect data off-line. however, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I think most users didn't even think that scientists could look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using the public Facebook walls of his students.
"When it was about them, they took it in such a way that there was information only between them and their friends."
It is also important to consider the methodology.
Even with the research off-line there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is not possible to verify how much of the profile information and wall posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn explains.
That’s why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, believes that the pen and notebook are still the best possible tools that can be used for research.
"When you go out to the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line."
"Cold and unhuman": Anders Behring Breivik takes part in his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who admitted to the establishment of two attacks in which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public trial in Oslo.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among the Norwegian Templar Knights,” he said in a court where 500 people gathered.
“I object to the court because the mandate has been granted to you by organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I am aware of my actions, but I do not confess any guilt for them.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika interrupted during this monologue because "he didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could raise his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought his prepared speech with him, to reach the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in prison for another 12 weeks, banned him from any contact with the media for 4 days, and announced that the authorities would have full control over all his visits and all his correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of the victims and survivors took part in the hearing.
Some came in the hope that they will be able to look at Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure he is held firmly under the lock.
Everyone took part in order to move the case to a quick closure.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and unhuman," one of the survivors told NRK.
"It was nothing pleasant, but for myself I can say that after I saw and heard a suspicious, I mentally moved a little further again."
Breivik, in a dark dress and a blue cravate, remained quiet and professional throughout the time of hearing. When arriving and leaving the building without trouble looking at the present journalists and survivors in the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre idea that he is part of a greater "resistance" movement, the judge declared he was not crazy, and noted that there was no evidence that he would have some co-actor.
For some it may be a comfort that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the sadness and confusion that is still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
“I wish she would fall like a beast, but that’s not the case,” said one of the victims’ relatives.
“If so, everything would be much easier.”
7 lessons from the lost conversation with Steve Jobs in the movie going to the cinema this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5, the views of people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear - and chose him as his genius The Greatest Modern Inventor.
In the recently re-discovered Job's interview, which was disguised for a special movie that goes to the cinemas this week, it will be for all Apple fans the fact that his creative mind has perfectly understood the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, dreamer and self-known member of the hippie movement, but at the same time also a pedant organizer and a man who fits every little thing into the smallest details - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "the idea that a really great idea is from 90 percent of their work... [but] between a great idea and a great resulting product is still a long way to work."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumph of Computer Crazy, which discussed the Dawn of Personal Computers. During the filming, a unique, more than an hour conversation took place.
That time it was ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and had full hands to work with his new computer company NeXT, and was looking at how widespread public will accept the internet.
In the TV show, only a short part of the entire Cringely interview was used, and the original copies of the interview were translated to be lost during transportation.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
This material, slightly cut down, forms the basis for the 68-minute film of Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which goes to the selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
On someone who is famous for his disappointment to provide longer interviews, here Jobs acts as surprisingly enthusiastic that he can talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And he also shows himself as a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the conversation it happens that there is a longer break between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when it is to see how Jobs perfectly thinks the answer to be as accurate and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism runs on the surface, when Cringely’s questions act impatiently and pushes him to get faster to more important issues and topics.
The interview was filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, and there appear terribly prophetic ideas when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and wrong, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read Jobs’ post-death career reviews, but on Jobs, which we see here as a desirable dreamer in the flowering of his genius, there is something raw and inspiring.
It has its own vision of how things can and should look.
It didn’t take a long time, and after he expressed his thoughts, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How to manage a business:
"In years of business, I always asked myself: Why do you do this? and the answer was always the same: Well, that's how it's just done."
No one knows why he does what he does, never thinks in depth about business matters.
I discovered that.
Jobs continues by describing his effort to simplify accounting in Apple.
He was completely confused with the way the costs were recorded - often they started with the writing "standard costs", about their amount he could only guess. At that time he decided to go out his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine the trade costs within a minute.
How he made a rooster to the Pope:
Jobs remembers the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively browse into a telephone company and free of charge call anywhere in the world.
A lot has been written about the device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as a power tool is literally contagious.
It tells us how the Wozniak devices were tested using a paid phone and during the call they were allowed to switch from one AT&T network to another, while using as many satellites as possible.
“At least half a hundred times we’ve gone around the world, so when we then screamed something in a paid phone, it was a minute later from the other phone at the door,” Jobs laughed.
“We were young and we found that we can build a thing that is capable of managing the infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world.”
We both made a small thing that was able to control a much larger work – it was an incredible experience and I think Apple would never be created without it.
Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night they called to the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, giving the best of Henry Kissinger.
The members of the Catholic Church were gradually called up to talk to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they awakened the pope himself to the phone, the couple broke up and put the headset.
How he fell in love with technology (and telephone with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and was looking for spare parts to build a diameter, he found the number to Bill Hewlet in his telephone list and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Jobs had a secure summer brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
“It was the only company I knew at that time, and it shaped my view of what it really is such a company and how it should be treated to my employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the corporate research laboratory in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
He was big like a suitcase, had a CRT monitor and I immediately fell in love with it.
As a teenager, I went up and up in HP, flocked around that computer and started writing programs for him.
How Innovation Improves:
In several places, Jobs talks during the interview about how he is inventing new products during the course.
At the beginning of his career, when he went to sell a couple of plates with flat connections, one customer asked him to set a whole computer together for him.
He had only 30 paid days, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later in Apple, he remembers the problems they faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember how we were quite wildly guessing ... they screamed on me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] until I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer."
Nine days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies are breathing:
Long before he led Apple’s resurrection, Jobs clearly predicted that many industry leaders in their vision would collapse and lose their market share.
Let’s say you’re working with IBM or Xerox, so you’re making better copywriters or printers, well and what next?”
You have a market monopoly, so the company can no longer be more successful.
In that moment, sales and marketing are ruling, so companies are chaired by people who are responsible for this, while people who are responsible for their own products are exhausted from the decision-making process.
The technological genius that led the company to its untouchable position is now replaced by people who do not have an idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are necessary.
This is the case with Xerox.
Xerox could possess the entire computer industry.
It could be 10 times bigger than it was, it could be Microsoft in the 1990s...
Instead of victory, they lost.
Innovation is a form of art:
“There is still a long journey and a lot of work between an excellent idea and an excellent resulting product... and as the great idea develops, it changes and grows.”
During that time you will learn a lot about it.
You have to approach a wide range of compromises - certain things simply electron, glass, robots or factories do not force you.
You have to keep in mind constantly 5,000 things – different concepts – and make them together.
Finally, it depends on the taste - you try to think about the best things that mankind has ever created, and in a certain way you try to reflect them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I’ve never been ashamed for stolen the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and, by the same time, the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they would be able to do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with the opponents of the health care law at the time their case was addressed by the court.
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind the closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question whether to accept an objection against President Obama’s health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a ceremonial dinner sponsored by a law firm that will take part in the trial before the court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges gathered to discuss the proposals.
One of the cases being discussed was the lawsuit raised by 26 states questioning the radical re-working of health care, which last year was approved by Congress - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
However, a 5.5 hour trial is expected in March, the result of which will further expand the presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012 and will be in full flow at the time of the decision.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and will try to reach the rejection of the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Prosecutor General during the George W. Bush government.
Clement’s legal company, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has been engaged for years in defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, is represented by one of the legal trade associations, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are in the process.
The dinner took place in the Washington Hotel a few hours after a court discussion on the subject of the case mentioned.
He attended, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Supreme Representative of the Republicans in the Senate and the confirmed opponent of the Healthcare Act.
And the guests? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: This couple of judges have participated in the activities of the Federalist Society group for years.
This is not anything that is contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct that are subject to lower federal judges.
If not, however, their behavior would definitely fall under the principle C4, which says that “the judge may participate in the events that the relevant and other organizations organize in order to obtain funds, but the judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, nor should he be listed on the agenda of the event.”
Nevertheless, Scalia and Thomas’ relationship with the two legal companies involved in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in the case, was richly enough to alarm the activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of behavior is contrary to the claim of several judges that the Supreme Court behaves according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause organization.
“The judges drunk and dinner for social benefit together with the lawyers waiting for their case to be discussed before the court.”
Their presence and help in obtaining funds through this action undermines the legs with all claims of uninterest, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed a little understanding of their critics and told them that they also easily combine their judicial duties with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas’s wife, Ginni, is a highly qualified conservative activist.
The conservatives also argue that the ethical problem is mainly the judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the Prosecutor General during the Obama government when the first objections against the law appeared before the court.
Kagan’s critics push her to refuse to participate in the case, claiming that she then fought so much for the law that she could now be uninterested.
Kagan did not indicate that she was going to resign.
Boeing receives $18 billion record aircraft contract
Emirates will order 50 Boeing 777 two-wheeled aircraft with the possibility of purchasing 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it receives more than $1 billion.
When a company receives an order for 50 pieces of its products, mostly it is not a reason to celebrate.
However, if that company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft is a record $18 billion, it’s something different.
The same important news is where Boeing has obtained the contract: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to the forecast released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order in history in terms of the dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-inch Boeing 777.
The sensational contract came from Emirates airlines based in Dubai.
At the 2011 Dubai Air Show, Boeing announced that the airline had the possibility to buy 20 more aircraft, making the total value of the contract up to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8, sometimes also called Dreamliner, which are proud of significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
“This is an excellent news for the entire Boeing company,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar analyst.
“The quality of these specific customers is very high.”
Many of the airlines in the Middle East belong to the nations that burn oil.
This means they have not only the money to pay the aircraft, but the rise in fuel prices – mostly damaging airlines, because it’s one of its greatest costs – is not so decisive, because the country itself earns on higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines that they could cancel or delay aircraft orders due to increased fuel prices, says Dihora.
“They have such a natural protection,” he says.
The order from Emirates strengthens Boeaing’s leading position in the broadband aircraft market and brings it to the narrow airbus SAS, which wanted to try to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus’ representatives announced that the first flight of their largest A350 will be suspended, which is the direct competitor of the 777-300ER.
The withdrawal occurred because customers demanded greater utility loads of the aircraft and the aircraft, so the manufacturer took time to provide the machine with greater power of the engine.
Boeing Co’s stock price rose 1.5 percent to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister was defeated in the Michoacán election
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon from the PRI, was helped in the hunt for the governor's chair by drug dealers.
The sister Felipe Calderona appears to have lost the post of governor in Michoacán in the violent state elections. on Monday she later stated that one of her opponents had been helped by drug dealers to win.
The preliminary results were attributed to the leadership in the governor's elections of the Western state to Faust Valley by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The interference of members of organized crime in the entire electoral process and especially in the course of yesterday’s elections is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our whole country,” Luisa Maria Calderon said in an interview with the radio day after Sunday’s elections.
“They threatened our candidates, members of the public opinion survey group...They closed the election urns, they built road barriers...and they allowed people to vote on an order for the PRI.
The PRI party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost its presidency.
However, it plans a quick return to power and the victory in the Michoacán elections is an important step in this effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential election in July.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who led a day before the election, just very tightly.
Calderon, a candidate for the conservative party of her brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejona as a winner.
The third place was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or the PRD, which until now has dominated the governor's office. For the unfortunate and unfortunate party, it is a very unfortunate defeat before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital named Morelia, rejects any relationships with drug dealers and encourages other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and metamfetamines.
It is the native state of President Calderon and in December 2006 in Michoacán began a military struggle against merchants.
But the violence continued.
The PAN mayor, the supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was murdered just a week before the elections and many candidates from the elections withdrew from fear.
However, regardless of how the results of the election in Michoacan look for the PRI party, the victory will help the party to get a new impulse.
The expected representative of the PRI party in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington congratulated Vallej and said: "I think this victory could be very encouraging in view of the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be prepared to help save the Eurozone from its serious debt crisis, otherwise the global economy could decline, which would have a negative impact on the growth of the economy in Asia.
Rajat Nag, Chief Executive Officer of the Bank of ADB based in Manila, said the two fastest-growing economies in the world have to "do everything they can" to help to rapid recovery of the monetary block through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the countries of the Bric Group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] follow all European difficulties "too unmotivatedly" and said that Asian financial assistance in combination with European leadership and funds will help to burn the long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all together.”
"So it's suitable for anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
“Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but it’s definitely not immune.”
“So if China and India can help, they should definitely do that.”
The European Monetary Association has been experiencing a serious debt crisis for several months.
In recent days, Italy’s loan costs have increased dangerously and Italian and Greek presidents have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that the global economy could be pulled back into recession, and a call has begun to unite emerging leading economies and help the Eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that all Asian support will be directed through the IMF, but noted that bilateral assistance — such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union Financial Aid Fund, the European Financial Stability Institution — would provide more negotiation opportunities to Asian partners from European countries.
Anand Sharma, the Indian trade minister, said that "India will do what it will be able" to help the Eurozone, because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and drying the flow of foreign capital.
“No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and unreliable,” he said.
“We are facing a difficult task and we have to maintain a high rate of growth.”
“It’s not an alternative, it’s a naked fact, because how otherwise we could find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies, such as the Indian, have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid for Europe to 1.2 billion people in India, when 800 million of them live from $2 or less per day.
“One day they could find that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and enjoy the holidays on the beach, which would be hard to explain to them,” he said.
Lee Howell, the CEO of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why Indian reserves should be used to maintain well-paid jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and losing sectors such as rail transport.
Mr. Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis is threatened by a "dangerous domino effect".
The bank’s forecast that Asia will have a 7.5% economic growth between 2011 and 2012 is now facing a “risk of decline” due to the European threat.
He stated that vulnerable developing markets need to create “unpredictable expenditure plans” to protect them from decline and significant capital flows from their economies.
Pentagon warning of possible defence cuts
The Defence Minister Leon Panetta on Monday at the Congress properly placed under the coat when he warned that rising automatic budget cuts could endanger national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting in the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend a $450 billion budget reduction over the next ten years, but now it is concerned that it will be reduced by another $600 billion if Congress fails to conclude a spending agreement.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the whole resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called obstacle would cause a 23% fixed decline and the stop of many new projects.
“Because of such a huge reduction, used in this unconscious way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or shipping projects – you can’t buy only three quarters of the building or ships.
“We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian staff, and as the reduction is to take place so quickly, we will also almost have to send civilians on forced vacation to be able to meet the target requirements.”
“These changes can shoot with the faith of those who take care of our army and seriously damage its preparation.”
Finally, the cuts will also affect the combat units, Panetta announced.
"Al the accounts for financing possible war operations abroad will not be directly affected by this procurement, the operations there will be negatively affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
“There will be cuts in the contractual staff, which will result in a delay in agreed contracts that support the war efforts of our people.”
“The status of paid employees will be reduced, which will result in delayed payments to suppliers and subsequent disruption of legal and political support.”
Both senators filed to Panett ten days ago and asked him for details about the possible effects of automatic cuts at the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of the deployment at the Ministry of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military force."
“We are strictly against this hard measure,” the Senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panett’s letter.
“It’s not a conclusion with which we could live, and we definitely don’t want to sign under it.”
“Planed cuts are a threat to the U.S. national security, which we should not allow.”
“It’s only to see if Panett’s letter and fresh warnings will increase pressure on Congress approving the budget and increase the voices calling for the Pentagon’s dismissal from the list of cut areas.
Panetta was recently increasingly open in talks about possible scratches, although he himself moved to his high position in the Pentagon with many years of experience with the approval of budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was put into a hard struggle.
At a press conference held a minute week, the Minister of Defense suggested a brief picture of what his resort can expect - the armor's shell, but inside which the core will be missing.
It will be like a ship without sailors.
“It will be like a brigade without ammunition.”
“It will be like an air force without trained pilots.”
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of castles, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of a Pentagon speech.
"It will be like a unmoral unit, unprepared and unable to deal with a possible enemy."
As a result, it will be welcomed by aggression.
In the annex delivered with a letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, it describes how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late reactions to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant limitation of landing and deployment possibilities worldwide; the predicted unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, Panetta added that some of the largest defence projects could be expected to be completed, including those that are already tested, and those that are just in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, the project of the F35, the planned new bombers, the new-generation ballistic submarines, the new coastal fighter vessels and the new ground fighter vehicle, which the army and the Navy wanted to replace humvee.
The stop of further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next ten years, but its supporters say it is a necessary further step in improving the army, which is necessary for the country to cope with potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize lies
A glimpse look at recent newspaper titles tells us how serious and everywhere lies and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has full hands of work with the accusation of having sexually harassed several women - both parties claim that the other one lies.
Managers at Penn State University were accused of false testimony as they tried to hide records that a retired football coach sexually attacked the boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was arrested as he sparked a microphone telling U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lies have been able to destroy the entire career and shake the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made himself foolish by publishing information that was immediately rejected by unquestionable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of abusing the funds of his campaign to try to hide his unmarried relationship.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that broke around Bill Clinton when he lies during the second period in the function about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewin.
This is the story of fraud in school and university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers, just to make them look good in their opinions.
Mentors, who should learn the opposite, broadcast the message that lies and fraud is acceptable.
How many fraud are we facing?
Studies show that in one day you get somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let’s assume that many of them are mercy lies.
Another study showed that strangers during the first ten minutes of their first encounter in their lives swallowed three times.
Determining lies, or “recognizing lies,” is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire, whether for personal or work reasons.
However, it’s not a social game that would be similar, let’s say, Sharada, when a man screams, “I have you.” Recognition of fraud is a serious industry of science working with scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been rejected.
The liars look calmly in your eyes.
It’s not that they would stick, cocktail, red or swallow.
But don’t think it’s hard to see and uncover the liars.
A trained lies identifier can reveal the truth from the phrase structure, small expressions in the face, the way questions are formed and their timing.
I’ve spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from the extensive and emerging field of lies recognition and it’s clear that detection of lies is a modern skill that can be easily learned and in today’s complex world it can help you greatly – especially if your job duties include hiring, organizing interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them be curved in vigilance, direct their emotions and intuitively realize how the other party accepts them.
From research we know that extroverts lie more frequently than introverts, that men speak more “self-centered” lies, while women say more lies “oriented on others” – mostly to protect someone’s feelings – that married people lie less frequently to their partners than free people (but the lies they say are mostly “unpleasant”).
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called “Primary Observation”.
This will help you to find out what to compare with later.
Note the body holding of the subject, his laughter, work with the voice.
You should know if someone is usually constantly knocking on his feet so that you do not unlawfully accuse him of lying just because he starts knocking on his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to determine the aggregates of false verbal and non-verbal behavior.
But take it only as a warning signal, not as evidence of a lie.
People who lie can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their imaginary story, they can shoe the top of the shoes to the door, tend to the east, significantly change the body’s attitude or show “relief after the end of the conversation” – excessive relief and change of position when it’s difficult to confess behind them.
People conducting interviews often issue a false signal that the interview is at the end, just to see how the relief will look after it is over.
Understand the subject’s language.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once overlooked and used the past time when he claimed that his murdered wife is alive, which started a national search for her body.
Lying individuals can also express themselves moderately: “I didn’t have any sexual relationship with that lady... Mrs. Lewin” or they repeat the difficult question.
The most common verbal characters are very small.
Someone can use a lot of “smelling language” when answering a difficult question: “Well... to say the truth... from what I know... according to my best consciousness.”
In such a response, we don’t know too much of the facts and it’s often another warning signal.
There is no magic to reveal every lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills through which a lie can be revealed.
With the help of these skills, a person will have a greater chance that in his personal and work fail to be a liar and fraudulent.
The controversial oil pipeline construction plan will be redirected after the threat of delay approval by the U.S. government appears
A few days after Obama’s government threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico – thus pushing the trade unions against each other but calming the environmentalists – the company responsible for the pipeline construction announced it was willing to redirect the project so that things could move back.
TransCanada on Monday evening announced that it will move the planned pipeline route from the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project will still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the government.
TransCanada's co-founder Alex Pourbax claims that the company is convinced that in the end the pipeline construction will be approved, even though it will lead another route.
This announcement came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week announced that it is delaying the decision on the federal approval of the project, from where it will not conduct a study of possible replacement routes, using which it would be possible not to interfere in the area of Sandhills in Nebraska and in the waterproof layer of Ogallala, a wide underground water reservoir.
"This is really a move forward," Republican representative Lee Terry from Nebraska told Fox News.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably postpone any decision until 2013, that is, a year after the elections next year, but the authorities refuse that politics would play some role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700 miles long pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the Alberta province to the refineries in Texas, it flows 700,000 barrels of oil per day.
There will be six countries going through this path.
This project is entirely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by staff who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the pipeline.
However, the lawmakers in Nebraska opposed this plan and considered the introduction of laws that would force the company not to interfere in the Sand Hills region and in the waterproof layer of Ogallala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The existing environmental impact study ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project will have only a small negative environmental impact, but a source from the energy industry said that the Ministry’s general inspector ordered a new review of the whole process of the original study, and focused mainly on two questions.
One time it was whether the lobbist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's 2008 adviser, did not represent a conflict of interest in the program.
The next is whether the company that was hired for the original study was not selected inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of being scared of fear.
The New York family says the singer Patti LaBelle angryly broke into the vestibule of their Manhattan house and scared their daughter so that she turned out of the fear.
"Lady Marmalade's performance scared the eighteen-month Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said in a lawsuit to the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10, last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a school teacher, and Genevieve were on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk landed the car, Roseanna Monk gathered their luggage down to the vestibule of their house in Riverside Boulevard and carried with her Genevieve.
Roseanna Monková said she stopped at the door for a moment and put the child down for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind my back and said, 'You know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and I went to lift her up.'
LaBelle irritated the pregnant woman.
“In an aggressive tone she told me, ‘You shouldn’t put your daughter to the door,’ Roseanna Monková said.
“I said to her, ‘I’m not interested in your opinion.’”
She was angry and began to speak foolish—writing loudly the simplest expressions...
She had a bottle of water, and she started drinking water from it.
He says Genevieve has been hit by a hysterical attack.
“I said to that woman, ‘Look what you’ve done to my daughter,’ the child’s mother said.
LaBelle was thrown on her mother – which still had Genevieve in her arms – and had to stop her until her accompanying, which later pulled her into the waiting car, Roseanna Monková said.
At the same time, her daughter was screaming so much that she turned back, adding.
Later, the family sent a letter asking for apologies to LaBelle, but they did not get any answers.
LaBelle’s lawyer and spokesman don’t respond to our telephone calls to comment on the whole case.
The prosecution demands closer unprecedented compensation, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken free of charge and that the family plans to all the dismissed money to dedicate to a charitable organization devoted to children with cancer.
“The goal is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions,” Davis said.
"This behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an eighteen-month child in his arms."
Climate disadvantage breaks the economy
During the first year of the government of Maria Lopez Valdeza, unemployment and unreliability increased in Sinaloa, foreign investments decreased and with them the economy increased.
The 2011 year will be recorded in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Maria Lopez Valdeza, which itself calls the government of change. This government has brought great expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to the unfavourable climate conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth has been and even the main indicators of economic development have decreased.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, limited the possibilities of growth of the state economy, are aware of a 3.6% decrease in economic activity in the first half of this year.
According to the report on the damages caused by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damages were recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated soil, of which 78,03% were completely destroyed and on the remaining 21,07% partial damages were detected.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a constant increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state recorded an increase in the first three quarters. From January to March, 55 053 inhabitants of the state of Sinaloa were unemployed, representing the unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate increased to 5.28% and between July and August, the average unemployment rate continued to rise and reached the value of 6.19%, which represents approximately 74,000 unemployed.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard Lopez Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on the steps that have been taken at the level of public policy.
“We are witnessing an increasing unemployment that is linked to various factors. These include, among other things, the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource restrictions as a result of a legislation approved by Congress in connection with the fight against money laundering. For people who illegally possess dollars, it is not easy to earn them, invest them or use them for something,” he emphasized.
Stop the migration
López Cervantes said that a demographic factor is also involved in the growth of unemployment.
“The number of people who leave for work abroad, to the United States, has decreased, on the one hand due to the reasons of difficult entry and then also because even if these people get outside the border, it’s hard for them to get a job.
Unreliability
According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the state works without giving benefits to the social security administration.
Unemployment and unreliability are added to other characteristics of the labour market, such as low wages. In this administrative territory, the lowest wages from all over the country, according to the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning registers.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5 352 pesets by September, deep below the national average, which moves to the amount of 7 375 pesets.
Reduction of Foreign Direct Investments
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, the most significant decline in foreign direct investments in the last 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, in the period from January to June, foreign direct investments reached 630 697 dollars, which represents a decline of 87.74% compared to the amount of 5 143 312 dollars in the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government reports investments of 17 280 million pesets per year.
Debt
In connection with the scenario of economic decline the government of this state requested in July the State Congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be intended for investments in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million pesos. Until November, no profits from debt were recorded, in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government Maria Lópeze Valdése pointed out the lack of governance skills of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, the chairman of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of the will of the individual sectors, including the government itself of the state.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really small during this year. we have to work intensely to get back the land we lost this year. in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we were missing to harmonize our efforts all and especially the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. We hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Slow economy
Loredo López said events like frozen at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including the colds. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which failed to recover quickly enough to re-establish dynamics that would allow to an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services.
Re-definition of mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employer Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state to more dynamic productive activities.
We believe it is necessary to prepare a long-term plan in which the goals and economic direction of the state will be redefined, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
The work that is ahead of us
Chairman Coparmex stressed the importance of setting a vision for the future that would better guide the government’s efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has been trying to good results in different areas, some progress has been made in the field of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He said that the current administration has shown progress in the leadership of public policy.
"There are elements that allow you to claim that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is work done here and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Condemned for 8kg marijuana
Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days fine for holding eight kilograms of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a health-threatening crime, namely for holding marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican army on June 7, 2010 during a walk in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of the station 80 in the El Castillo district, Navolato.
The dealer was in a pick-up type of white color. In the car in the police had a black bag and a small bag on the passenger's seat. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained available to the Judges of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of Legal Impacts of Crimes.
Contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programs such as Habitat, Public Places Rescue and 3x1 for migrants, face the risk that they will not be questioned until the end or that they will have a great delay due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Urban Social Development said that if so far the construction work has gone forward, it is now threatened that the state government will not be able to provide the relevant supplies that require funds of more than 11 million pesos for three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos. the state falls 25%. until this time the funds for work were supplied only by the Federation and the city, therefore it is possible that the implementation of the projects will be delayed.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and although the year is already coming to the end, we didn't get anything at all. And that despite the fact that we had to get a part already in July," he said. "To not waste time, the projects we started and continue very well, but we lack money."
He said that last year under the administration of Jesus Aguilara Padilla the state failed to comply with the corresponding supplies, and therefore at the beginning of the new period the city had to apply for a loan to be able to pay more than 7 million, which the state administration did not give them.
“The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state had no economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. To get to the aforementioned programs this year, we had to get funds that would cover what the state did not complete,” he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a promise by state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he said that the request was sent to Armandu Villarreal, Secretary of Administration and Finance, to accelerate the procedure and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
"They had to give us 12 million and although the year is near to the end, we have not yet received a peso."
The court approves "the end of analogic broadcasting" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional appeal submitted by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which wants to accelerate the so-called "output of analogic signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the court chairman, Juana Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued a decree that specifies the individual steps that will lead to the transition to ground digital television.
This result rejected the appeal submitted by the Senate because the qualified majority of eight votes needed for the court to make an opinion on the constitutional or unconstitutionality of the referred decree, which thus remains in force, was not achieved.
The proposal for a judgment prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposes the possibility to declare the decree unconstitutional because the regulation of all matters relating to radio and television is a matter that is, according to the law, reserved to the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument both the Senate and the House of Representatives supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to fight the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the implementation of the decree and all the actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitization.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the appeal submitted by the House of Representatives without entering the discussion of the proposal, which is also responsible for the Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech the Prime Minister stated that he does not match the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal execution cannot structure through the general standards of measures to prepare the public administration.
"I don't think that even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority," he recalled that the planning of public policy in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analog signals by digital is one of the greatest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is associated with better use of radioelectric spectrum, better quality of signal and multiple channels.
He believes that delaying the change would mean delaying the benefit of digitalization, which requires decisions in matters of public interest. digitalization in fact has not only a technical dimension, but "it also affects economic, social, political and national security issues."
As he emphasized, these issues “require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state.
He recalled that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and did so through their governments, even though they had highly specialized technical authorities available.
He pointed out that it is impossible for the government, by issuing a decree that interferes to a certain extent in the area of Congress’s powers, to introduce in the area of administration compliance with the laws prepared by legislative power.
In Michoacán, they analyze the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the data published by the PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the governor's elections is less than 27 percent.
The possibility of counting "voice by vote" appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where according to the data published by the Program for preliminary election results (PREP) the difference between the first and second place in the governor's elections is less than 27 per cent, and this has not yet been counted by the votes of 879 of the total 6074 electoral districts.
In this context, the Chairman of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that a few days ago, 9 November, the Electoral Authority approved a series of measures to harmonize local standards with the federal election reform.
As it will be recalled, Michoacán has not officially confirmed his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Law on Electoral Justice. The State Congress has approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force had to pass in this election period and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has forgotten their publication within the specified deadline in the Law of the Official State Journal with the fact that he had some objection against them.
On 9 November, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislative power and declared the head of state’s voice in the matter of constitutional reforms “invalid and illegal” because he has the right “neither to approve nor veto them”.
On the question of the possibility of counting "voice by voice" María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the General Council of the IEM will be possible that partial and total counting is carried out by the local electoral authority.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, one or more voting packages, will be possible under the following conditions: voting results disagree; there is no registration of voting and calculation in the corresponding box or it is not available by the Chairman; or if there have been errors and obvious violations of the voting results.
In addition, a total recounting of votes in all elections will be possible if there is indication that the difference between the potential winner of the elections and the candidate in the second place is less or equal to one percentage point; whenever at the beginning of the session appears an explicit request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition that proposed the candidate in the second place.
The total recounting of votes will also be possible when, after a proper counting, the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal or less than one percentage point and also whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate ended in the second place.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second places is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ash will be spread in the mountains of Zapalinamé, the family confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown.
According to the family, the ultimate desire of the subcontinent was that his ashes would be dispersed in the mountains of Zapalinamé.
After, together with the other people who died in the accident, received the highest honour, the family of Bacio Cortése returned to the capital Coahuila on board the aircraft of the Mexican Air Force.
In the afternoon, the subcolonel's ashes arrived in the chapel located in the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where family and friends also arrived.
At 5:30 a.m. a farewell was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, which was organized by his former high school tech colleagues and members of the American football team, whose Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of graduation preparation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla and his desire was that his ashes were spread in the mountains of Zapalinamé. so he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the sub-colonel fulfilled all the wishes, he was at the peak of life, "it was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and entered the Colegio del Aire air school in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he even was driving a truck, however he always went for his dream of becoming a pilot.
His grandson Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "Sotva came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopán to promote his uncle, so he is convinced that he died with what he had loved in his life: driving a plane.
He gave his last goodbye.
With Felip Bacio Cortés, Deputy Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that came to give him Governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and the government of the state, the Mexican Army through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technology High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he stands out both in the studio and in the sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the past days after a helicopter that was driving fell. On board was also the Secretary of State, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of the state.
At 18:05 the remains of the saltillan native Bacio Cortése (depleted) arrived to be transferred through the funeral service to the Mexican Air Force under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez to the space where the family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, sisters and other relatives, students and teachers gathered.
Three dead bodies were found on Cadereita NL.
A few hours before the discovery, military officials presented to the media 11 people who were detained in the area for crimes associated with organized crime.
The bodies of three men killed by shooting into different parts of the body and head were found on the abandoned ship of the Cadereita Jiménez village, Nuevo León.
It was found on a 1.5 km road from Cadereita to Santiago, on the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People moving in these places noticed that the chalet with a beige-cafe plot had open doors from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the corpses of three people, so they immediately warned the competent authorities.
One of the people wore a sporting t-shirt of yellow color and dark cotton pants and was not covered. next to him, a man was also in a sporting t-shirt with white stripes.
A few meters further there was the body of another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three lie in the face toward the ground.
According to the data obtained on the site, all three persons were likely to be killed elsewhere because the ammunition was not found.
On the ceiling of the chateau were found messages addressed by one group of organized crime the other and also a series of footsteps after the bullets, both on the building and on the door.
11 suspects arrested in Cadereita
The Secretary of National Defense presented 11 persons, including youths, who were members of a criminal group operated in particular in the Cadereita area and which is associated with kidnapping, murders, persecution and illegal burial.
According to the information published in the first attempt on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros, eight people were arrested and one person was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured.They confirmed that they are members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
The military staff was on a walk in the Rancho Viejo area in Cadereyta when he noticed cars without SPZ and two people in it.
After the car stopped, they conducted a tour and discovered one gun, a munition and 18 munitions.
Then, on the basis of these statements, on November 13, around 14 a.m., one of the Complices in the La Frauda area was arrested.
They were accused of illegally buriing in the municipalities of General Teran, China and Cadereita.
The new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
Nominated Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present him a new government that will face the crisis that keeps the country over the gap of economic disaster.
Nominated Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him a new government that will face a crisis that keeps the country over the gap of economic disaster and threatens the entire euro area.
The presidential palace issued a report in which it announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgi Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm him that he can form a government.
It is expected to be presented by a government composed of a majority of technocrates, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present the president the results of his talks he led with political parties in an effort to form a government.
“I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country’s ability to overcome this difficult phase,” the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti explicitly did not say he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that obstacles are overcome.
“The frame is now well marked,” he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, that is, in a much shorter period than usual.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Montim must approve the hard package of savings that European leaders require.
Due to the market instability, interest rates from Italian bonds BTP with a 10-year deadline exceeded the 7 percent limit, the level where Greece and Ireland had to ask for a rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, the chairman of the Italian employer organization Confindustria, told reporters after a meeting with Montim: "We said we would greatly support this government."
We believe that this government is the last way to get Italy out of this burning situation.
Monti's hopes for success have increased significantly thanks to the support of PDL Silvia Berlusconi, who was forced by the crisis to resign on Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are predestined to good results,” said Angelina Alfano, the secretary of the middle-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant, since until this moment a whole number of its members were opposed to the government with a technocratic majority, which is composed by Monti.
Support of Parliament
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to promote unpopular savings reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in an effort could cause a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Foreign Bank Association has joined the pressure and warns that Monti’s failure could result in a disaster.
Monti began talks with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women organizations on Monday.
The meeting will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitan, which allowed a very fast progress in response to the crisis.
After a short fall from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, the interest rates of Italian bonds returned to the critical boundary, reacting to the uncertainty whether the new Prime Minister will gain success.
To save Italy, whose public debt is 1.8 trillion euros, would be beyond the possibilities of the current financial reserves of the euro area.
Monti said his government should remain in power until the next elections, which are scheduled for 2013, despite the general forecasts that politicians claim to give him time only to carry out reforms, and then proclaim early elections.
Monti said he would like to incorporate policies into his cabinet, but big parties insist that this government must be made up of only experts to get Italy out of the difficulties that the country has come into due to financial pressure.
Political sources said that mutual uncertainty and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to incorporate both political and political personalities into the government.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Rica
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will cross the border of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 invited players reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rica side if we compare 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 on the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and Europe champions, the number one of the FIFA monthly ratings, have a wide range of class A matchs on their account, Costa Rica has only the defense Michael Umana, who as the only one played 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers, playing in the Star Wars and in the powerful clubs of the English First League, maintain intensive activity over a year at the league championships and domestic cups and high-level matches within the European Cups such as the Champions League.
To the previous we have to add also the experience of the Spanish national team in complicated removal matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rica's players, on the contrary, have very limited possibilities of foreign matches in the area. There is here for example Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within the FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish team has on his account the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (defeat 0-1 in London) reached the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches.
Casillas will face Costa Rica and win a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, the main player of Barcelona, has 106 matches on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even last week officially announced by the UEFA along with other Spanish players who have on their account a hundred matches. Among them the already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol has won 97 matches.
The following are Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and close to Michael Umana, the left wing of Júnior Diaz moves with 48 matches and the goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Further, only 5 crossed the border of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The minimum number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain figure Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Víctor Bolívar has only one in Costa Rica and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
Spain's best shooter is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rica side, Bryan Ruiz has the most interventions, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour on the occasion of celebrating the 20th anniversary of existence
“The journey to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes reality.”
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the band is ready to offer one of the best concerts on the National Stadium next Sunday.
We’ve been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that for them the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a fulfilled dream.
This is what the basist and founding member Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour on the occasion of the celebration of the 20th anniversary of existence and on Sunday 20th will be on a unique stop in Central America.
This day will appear from 19:30 on the National Stadium together with the angel group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample of the interview, the full translation of which can be found on the La Nación website on the Internet.
Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The journey to Costa Rica is also our dream that becomes reality.
We are hardly in South and Central America for the second time and the experience has been great.
I’ve been in Costa Rica only once, on a holiday. It’s a wonderful country and I believe we’ll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we are very pleased that we can bring our music to you.
I ask, because here the group is literally loved, fans experience these preparation days very intensely.
What do you say to your best supporters?
Thank you for staying with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we regret it took us so long.
Some people talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does this cause greater pressure on you?
Some of the greatest shows we have shown over the past 21 years have emerged within a few weeks.
We showed a few great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we get into form for a concert in Costa Rica.
We really look forward to this concert.
We love this country, we love surfing, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and its waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends ride to surf Costa Rica or to Nicaragua, or to Mexico. These are the best places to surf. And so we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared an enormous show with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Because we’ve never played here, we don’t have any limitations that we couldn’t do.
We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You will never repeat the repertoire.
Why ?
I think it is partially because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs we’ll play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not played for a long time, we focus on them and we are also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and therefore I think it is more interesting for people.
This tour is celebrating 20 years of art.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve done?
Yes, it is sure.
First, I think no one of us could imagine we’re in one big rock group and we’re in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much we have been given and impress us that we can continue to play together.
We love and love to make music.
We are lucky to be able to look at the places we have always wanted.
We couldn’t get better.
What did you mean that you were an important part of the formation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, in which the giants are represented.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It is surprising when the movement arises from a group of friends, too often it does not happen.
From time to time there will be a group in the city, but it is much less common that five to ten groups come out of one city at once.
We are proud of it and we are honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play with some.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on a tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored that we can be part of this movement that was created in Seattle.
It is also very unusual that a group like yours keeps together and still has the same members after those years.
Yes, we four have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a much longer time than the usual duration of the group.
I think, first of all, we are all lucky that we are still in this world and second of all, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other plays our role.
We are all close friends and thanks to this we managed to open the music pathways that leave everyone enough freedom to experiment with themselves.
We trust each other, we appreciate the music of the other, and I think it could not be better.
Your relationship with the word glory was not easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew, it was more and more easy to find balance.
We try not to ride too much to the tour because it’s very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you will remember that you have to respect the music and what you gave it. You should not let yourself be kidnapped by being famous, rock stars.
What about Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote great songs and it was something great at the beginning.
As a band we existed for three years and we never released any album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we get friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in a band with us. When I listen to a song or look at the pictures, I remember Andy how incredible he was, how I laughed with him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, laugh, talk about music or football and many more.
He was an incredible person and we lack the power.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to launch the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why you’ve chosen them as the predecessors?
Yes, the production sent us videos with a few suggestions and this group liked us the most. Therefore we are curious what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very fun.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter?
This is a question to Eda (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know it.
He sings it and I think he adds the first thing he feels.
Who affects you as a basist?
A lot of people.
I am first attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I can talk all night about the basists I like.
How did Pearl Jam keep the grunge even though it’s no longer in fashion?
I think we’ve always felt slightly separated from the word grunge.
When grunge is said, I will imagine the groups I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that were created at the same time. And if music is valid today, then it’s something great because it’s the music that’s worth listening and groups like Mudhoney today play better music than ever before.
At first, your music had a slightly empty character and now it’s more positive.
What is worth this change?
This is interesting because I feel that in the new album there are a few songs that are lighter, but there are also songs such as The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very cloudy, although they may sound positive.
At both, when Ed played them to me, I was crying, and the songs are deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or friend, these things begin to affect your art and music, and these two songs for me are just this.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make a foolish music.

Fujimori was hospitalized due to medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss he suffered in the area of the lower limbs.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including cancer of the tongue, for which he has been operated four times and is currently under the control of doctors.
Deputy Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told Canal N that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases within three days, where they should find out why he is hurt and why he loses strengths in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that according to his opinion, Fujimori could receive grace for humanitarian reasons, however the former president himself does not want grace because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times due to tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms and added other disorders such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in the legs.
Fujimori has been sentenced since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people killed by the murdering squad of the army operating illegally in the first years of his rule.
Mujica visits Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the President of Uruguay, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessately, will start a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. Its objective is to an expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch the political topics of the region.
Mujica will meet on Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felip Calderón. This is the most important meeting of an extensive visit full of meetings with politicians, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political matters between the two countries," the Uruguay presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to force Calderon to support Uruguay in the dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the country in the list of tax paradises at the G20 meeting in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that will continue to remain in the position of tax paradise will be expelled from the international community. This statement caused a rejecting opinion by Uruguay and consultation with a ambassador in this European country.
Mexico has been the leader of the G20 since November.G20 is a group made up of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world.The Latin American country has since January this year signed an information exchange agreement to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguay government has been seeking to concrete the agreements on fiscal exchange in order to get out of the "black list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which countries have not introduced all the required international standards of tax cooperation.
From a trade point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which helped to strengthen goods exchanges between the two countries.
Youat installers run in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been struggling for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the spars of the thief Bowser, but has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to all stores around the world, has been created from the beginning to take advantage of all the features offered by the portable Nintendo 3DS console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
“Mario is a character who has to tell how the stereoscopy without glasses should work,” said Omar Álvarez, a press officer at Nintendo in Spain, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier" because until this moment successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
A spokesman for Nintendo said that in addition to the image is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth party.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you overcome this level, you can go into the "second round" on the levels of the game, which are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of action. but it will be necessary to play in 3D so that it is possible to overcome a variety of challenges and "not subject to optical fraud".
This new Super Maria's 3D arrival also predicts the character's return to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays in the note to those who watch the saga and repeats the successful formula from the previous parts. It consists in the fact that the brown man's installator will have to pass through dangerous mined platforms to release Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in the movements, in the surroundings, in the clothes and also among the enemies, the "playing" Luigi will also appear.
Colom approves Portilla's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom on Tuesday announced that he had taken steps on the issue of the extradition of former President Alphonse Portill, who is to be responsible in the United States for a conspiracy to wash $70 million.
This is how the trial ends, with the aim of Guatemala to respond to the request of a northern country that requires the extradition of Portilla to be able to judge him.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision is in line with the independence of judicial and executive powers and that he reminds that the criminal court has already ordered extradition.
He assured that during his mandate he was "not interfering" in court decisions and allowed all the extraditions that came to him on the table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be released for murder and serious health injuries and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's step means a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to conduct a trial against the former president, who ruled between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the judgments of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after his legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights respect will be guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent in the case of fraud 120 million at the Ministry of Defense at the time of his presidency. This process preceded the release, but the Ministry of Public appealed and thus returned the case to the game.
Trinjove has helped 6,000 young people in danger
The organization was created to help children without education not feel at the edge of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the existence of the Trinjove Social Support Organization is very important: 6,000 young people who were threatened by social exclusion received assistance.
It is necessary to add to the long hundred jobs that have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday’s anniversary also served to present the balance in the framework of the ceremonial act, which took place in the former Fabra and Coats factory production spaces and in which more than 300 people participated.
Trinjove was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, unemployed, drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday’s meeting in Sant Andreu attended a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
A variety of political representations, during the election, showed the unified nature of the work that Trinjove carries out.
Together with the president of Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the ceremonial act was attended by the former socialist educational adviser, Ernest Maragall, and the former deputy mayor and current ecological-socialist council, Ricard Goma.
In the big hall of Fabra and Coats also arrived the current Advisor for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and Director-General of Social Work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinity was created in a very difficult time and that today’s time also poses a number of obstacles, but he added that the work that the association has brought to this day is “a good basis.”
The President has given Trinjove as an example of how it is possible to fight against unfavourable circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
“The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does,” he said.
There was a displacement of a house in which a giant party was held.
Aliens owned 11 of 13 apartments in Balmes, 51
Twelve occupants left the house on Wednesday afternoon without resistance.
Everything suggests that the nightmare that the neighbors from the 51th Balmes Street experienced is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they illegally lived and where they organized giant parties that awakened neighbors.
After the operation was completed, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent the repetition of the situation.
“From this moment, the entrance will be watched,” the manager said.
The occupants, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical and partially water equipment, in addition to painting the walls and leaving all kinds of waste, especially bottles of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments held enormous parties, which lasted up to two days and awakened the other tenants.
Near the building is a discoteca, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that during the time the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the discoteca emphasizes that the occupants of the building made it an unfair competition because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the discoteca costs 10.
But the problems were not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially those who attended here organized parties, whose frequency and intensity have increased in recent weeks, according to the angry inhabitants around.
The owner of the discoteka explained that the problems were so big that they even agreed with the owner of the building and for nine months has forgiven her rental.
The city police also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors over the situation over the past few weeks.
People's Party PP City Group Chairman at the Municipality, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week demanded that "the building be immediately displaced and ended with the problems of civil coexistence that neighbors suffer, and the destruction of the area."
The President of the People explained that only one floor was blocked before the summer, but in the last months the occupants have reached all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and in one of them there have been even theft.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to stop with impunity and be consistent when it comes to acts against civil liability that occurred in the building."
The city police also cleaned the building in Nou Barris.
At 15:30 a.m., the police arrived in the 35th building on Mont-ral Street after it was called by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or Mountains?
Architects gathered on the occasion of writing a proceedings that carries more than controversy about fees
The city selection procedure for 16 doors again opens the debate on the role of the Collserola park in Barcelona.
In the middle of the 1980s, during the time of the greatest flourishing already disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this municipality printed several pamflets to support the Collserola park.
It defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of Barcelona.
Moreover, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with the New York Central Park.
After the CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the mind of many as the top border of Barcelona. the Catalan metropolitan is in fact one of the few that are not oriented to the north-south axis, but up (high) - down (the sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park goes in this direction.
The reference was not Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild bears instead of the bear Yogi.
This was the position until September, when the municipality announced a mega competition consisting of 16 competitions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
The door, of course, is recording the idea of the park.
Whether this, or someone is trying to put the gate to the field.
So the only question arises: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from the point of view of purely organizational and based on the city reflection, this question becomes the central topic of all Barcelona architects.
It’s already a topic as dirty as when two members of this old castle chosen at a meeting in the elevator give their hands.
And this is exactly what caused one of the rare coincidences between what three Barcelona architects and advanced university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender proceedings have their own justification.
According to Roldan, after the question of the Gulf Party began, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain side", so Ildefonse Cerda's speech about green apples was not quoted to the end.
“We must rely on the principle that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its high availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "the gates to Collserola" in itself carries a "lexicological hole": we should not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a definition of zones where it is possible to operate."
Modol, like Roldan and Bayona, with experience from the world of urbanism qualifies the design as a "intellectual challenge" bringing "some dangers".
The danger arising from the “uncertainty presented today by the public site project” after the experience of the 1980s, which had in the forum “their labouty singing”.
The first concern is to define the boundaries where it should be built.
“To define something means to take the next step,” that is, in principle, to move one step further.
"We need to keep in mind new urban and planning tools, because those present (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan) can cause a real disaster."
If we focus more in detail on the question, Modol believes that the Collserola valley can be "thought as a park", but the Barcelona part does not, and that for purely topographic reasons.
Modol also reminded that there is already the work carried out by Patronat de Collserola, which "should not end in the wastehouse", although he welcomes the fact that the municipality offers his grémium that it will interfere with the project from the "first moment".
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountains and cities is a kind of gap that allows architects to engage in the debate, but he “dubbs” that it should be just this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams (“it’s all about skills,” he adds), which must be created: “Architects should be only tools.”
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name to this game is complicated, because in the subjects for the tender proceedings there is no global vision of Collserola: "16 tender proceedings have been announced that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no long-term study that would look at the area and understand it as a whole."
This makes that at least he, signed up to all 16 tender proceedings.
Otherwise, the project of a single gate can face the concept and definition of the architect of the neighboring gate.
According to him, the municipality should ensure that the area located directly above the Ronda de Dalt should provide equipment throughout the area to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino has forgiven Jonási Larrazábal who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the lawful author Cadino Red gave grace to Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged harassment.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent 72 days in jail and will now be released after the lawful authority of Casino Red gave him grace before the Second Criminal Court in the district, which discussed the case of the harassment in which the brother of the mayor of Monterrey was accused.
After the assassination at Casino Royale, Casina Red owner, Sergio Gil García, posted a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonas had to ask him to pay the economic quota so that the municipality of Monterrey allowed an illegal operation in the gambling house.
After the public prosecution, the State Prosecutor's Office began the criminal proceedings of the brother of the panistic mayor. on 2 September, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After 4 hours spent in front of the Agent of the Public Ministry number 3 for property crimes he was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the capital of the state.
He remained in this place the following 49 days after the second arrest order was issued and the public ministry agent denied the possibility of co-participation or organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereita for suspicion of cheating the owners of the Casino Red in the amount of one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in prison with medium heavy supervision because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in the city cells in San Nicolás de los Garza during the process.
On October 25, he was sentenced to an arrest order issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who declared that after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence was collected to prove Jonas' guilt. The evidence includes, for example, the payment of the amount of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the casino in exchange for the promise that the operation will be allowed.
On Monday, Casina Red's lawmaker, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, came to judge José Luis Pecin and asked for grace for the brother of the mayor of the region.
During the legal trial, the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez if the damage was corrected and who of the associates decided to grant grace.
On the basis of the official document 197/2011, a legal grace is granted to Jonási Larrazábal. In the proceedings that was conducted against him, no complaint is possible.
After a trial with the lawmaker around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton.
The court secretary, Jorge Yanéz, arrived in a prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he was granted an official grace and his case was postponed in the archive.
He also told him that the judge issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details about the air crash in which the Secretary of State, Francisco Blake, and seven other people were killed.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) that the results of the investigation of the accident in which the Prime Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven others died show that the helicopter fell directly on the ground with full force without the pilot had the chance to try forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft was launched, the pilot stated that the climate conditions allow flights.
"The parts that appear indicate that the unit came in contact with the ground several times, the wings plunged into the branches of trees 25 meters from the place where the unit lost the body."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons, therefore it meets all requirements for the transport of staff.
In addition, he said that on the basis of the investigation carried out in the area of the collision, no components were found on the ground.
“With the search, it was found that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft hit the land as a whole.
“The helicopter was intended for 19 people, it meets all the requirements for passenger transport.
The ground shows a curve with a inclination of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment it is most important to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Assistance Services, said that at the moment of the collision, the President's General Staff's helicopter was moving at a travel speed and the accident occurred on a soft upper ground.
“This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a regular overlay operation,” he said.
At a press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome mentioned six key points of the investigation:
The Visual Flight:
According to the air standards, the flight was implemented according to the rules of visual flight, that is, the crew must see on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological Conditions :
The reports in the AICM indicate adequate conditions at departure, according to which the aircraft progresses in the direction of the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico were visible layers clouded at low heights.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the clouds the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility up to the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
The collision coordinates and the last record of the helicopter from the radar coincide, it is likely that before the collision there was no loss of control or disturbance of the flight trajectory.
Distribution of aircraft remains on a limited territory:
The information we are currently available allows us to assume that the collision occurred on the straight trajectory and from the side.
The picture of the dispersion of the remains of the aircraft suggests that at the time of the land attack the helicopter was holistic.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence on the site of the accident that would indicate that there was an explosion or a fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that there could have been several contacts with the continent.
During the fieldwork, the remains of the aircraft were found at a height of up to 9200 feet above the sea, the ground is swallowed, the height of the inclination goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show images in which there was likely a breakdown along the mentioned route.
The information provides elements that appear to suggest that the helicopter could get into contact with the land in several places.
After a thorough search in the vicinity of the accident, no remains of the helicopter were found on a territory that is larger than the landing area, which reinforces the assumption that the crash occurred in a state where the helicopter was still intact.
Mexican Institute of Health Insurance Starts Research on the Gen That Causes Obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance is conducting research to discover the genes responsible for the obesity of children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the Institute of IPN
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to detect the genes that cause obesity in children and young people. The research called "Genetics of Obesity in children and adolescents" will allow to obtain results related to overweight.
In a report, the head of the Research Medical Unit in Biochemistry from the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Center of the 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
People can come to the participating IMSS sports centers in the Valle de México, where each summit from 8 hours will be conducted tests for teenagers.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexico State) and since October 8 this activity is also carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Centre (Eastern Mexico State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children will be obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to determine the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity, and to track on Mexican children and young people risk factors and thus prevent the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on November 14, he reminded that the goal is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutritional questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney insufficiency.
He clarified that every Saturday, all participants are performed anthropometric measurements (weight, height, belt circle), blood pressure is measured, the level of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin is determined, and genes are examined (there are attempts to identify the genes that are involved in the formation of childhood obesity).
Cruz López said this research reflects the concerns of healthcare professionals about the alarming increase in child weight.
“Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years only boys had an increase in obesity by 77% and girls by 47%.
He said that one of the reasons for searching for indicators is the assumption that the country’s population is different from the other populations by its genetic history.
He that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that generally obesity genetics is commonly explained as the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they get a total assessment of the child’s condition, thus finding out whether they show some known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearms indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-diabetes conditions.
For now, the information is confidential, the doctors transmit it in writing to the parents and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make in order to avoid their children from the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sitting way of life meaning a lack of daily physical activity, a day-to-day sitting in front of TV and using transportation instead of walking on short distances.
Overweight is also caused by high calorie intake, i.e. greater consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no excuses in Asfalt.
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Chemical Faculty, creates modified asphalt with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climate conditions and temperature.
If the clay was properly carried out, 200 thousand clay would not need to be repaid after every rain period in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who also added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt clay were adequate, there would be a significant limitation of clay or even it would be possible to completely remove them.
In his lecture The Technological Cause of Clashes, which he spoke in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalt with polymers, thus creating a mixture with similar characteristics as asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climate, for example in some cities in the north of the country.
He explained that asphalt, the heavest part of oil, is a group of carbohydrate molecules, molecules with a large molecular weight, which are called asphaltens, and others with a low molecular weight, which are called maltens.
The viskoelastique character of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in a solid state, while at low temperatures it has a tendency to break, he added.
This means that the asphalt resistance in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperature, the chemical engineering expert pointed out.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered by a flexible plate that consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers is an asphalt insert, formed by small stones wrapped in asphalt and then pressed.
He emphasized that every stone that forms the insert is filled with asphalt.
When passing the cars or creating pressure, it is possible that the forces in the plate are well distributed.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would dissolve even better, a chemical engineer believes.
He added that on the asphalt insert is placed the last layer called a coat, formed by fine stones, i.e. sand also wrapped in asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with the rafts of the vehicles, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and must ensure the traction of the road.
Since as part of the sliding will be exposed to a large burden, the coat must have a sufficient thickness and must be careful about the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially moisture and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. especially water has a great impact on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the ground is wet, the water spreads inside and it’s hard to get out, it causes the softening of all layers of the plate and thus the formation of moulds.
He explained that during the creation of the scratches the film of the coat is first destroyed and only then the asphalt insert is damaged. The damage does not occur at one moment, but it is a slow process that should be stopped already at the first signs using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of the vehicles is another important factor in the formation of clay, and therefore the thickness of each layer of the plate must correspond to the load of the vehicles and must ensure that this load does not exceed.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that when it comes to asphalt, a lot of work is still waiting for us and research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and allow easy repairs without having to use high temperatures.
What missed the candidate from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not win the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle won the 14th first multi-miss title.
The Valle del Cauca won the Miss Columbia Crown.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with finding herself on the stage of the winners, winning a silver crown and sherpa, on the basis of which she became the new first multi-miss of Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, in which she won and seized Miss Atlantico, the aforementioned department won the 14th title of the first multi-miss. Melina so joined the crowds of women from the Valle del Cauca, which reached the winning crown, but eventually were proclaimed the first multi-miss. Among them are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Romero (1993), Garcese Garcese Garcese Garcese Garcese Garcese Garcese Garcese (2007).
A question that a lot of people are asking, what is missing?
The result is the defeat of the great favourite, who in all previous rounds showed that she has to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain became the Queen of Police and the Most Beautiful Face of Joile de Volgue.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name her only First Multi-Miss is the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question: "Which book you liked the most and why?", which was put by Martín Murillo Gómez of the literary editorial Leamos.
The candidate answered the question:
"I read a lot. I really believe in the role of literature, I think it's one of the forms of culturalization. The book that influenced me most in my childhood was "The Little Prince", a very deep book.
It is a book that is part of global literature that we should all know. And today I have a book by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian author. This is a wonderful book entitled "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer didn’t like, on the one hand, because of the term “culturalizing” and, on the other hand, because the candidate didn’t explain what the individual mentioned books noted her.
After the ceremony ended, Melina declared that she was calm and pleased with the result: "The world is wise, what is to happen, what will happen.
“And you people, read if you can, the little prince is a wonderful book.”
Another hypothesis is that Valle destroyed the favourite position.
The Bogotsky journalist suggested that the candidate was from the beginning the most popular, the most celebrated and the one who took all the previous awards (Gastronomic Challenge Oster, the public title for the best art dress and Queen Mother), raised the jealousy of other candidates, stressed the queen, which then burned on the scene.
This was visible at the first presentation of the swimwear on the Hilton Beach and during two shows before the final crown.
Though both were bright, it was known that she lacked the strength and inflammation that representatives from Magdalena and Atlantis showed.
Ariel Osorio, a program reporter "As at home" on Canal RCN believes that Melinda's first multi-miss title confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition ultimately doesn't go with the Queen's crown."
Moreover, Valle in the last few days had a rather unpleasant attitude towards the media and that didn’t make it worth him.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is the foundation of the National Beauty Competition.
Just on the edge, two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said they are looking for a woman who will be aware of the social needs of their country.
"In the Miss Colombia competition beauty itself is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. it is necessary to focus on social feelings. it is important that candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explained.
It is also speculating that the candidate Valle lost points due to the deficiencies of her background and fibrosis that was visible on the backdrop. But this is completely contrary to the judgment of the jury that chose her miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queen, acknowledges that Melina didn’t have the best body, that there were better girls, “but problems with fibrosis on the back, which, in my opinion, was not too noticeable, took her points until the last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos from the magazine Cromos believes that a family member from Valle made a mistake when she underwent several surgical procedures.
"The surgical interventions are fine, but they did not succeed in Valle.
The body has never been her strong side and here she has chosen her tax.”
Because of this award, which was first awarded by the National Assembly of Beauty, after the show in the swimming clothes there was a cruel forecast that was fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo gave Melina so that she had not finally to give her the highest crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that Melina today began the year of her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where it will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, it will be recorded in history as one of the queens who, despite the strangling success in Carthage, did not reach the highest crown.
This was the work of a Cali resident who identified the body of Alfonse Cana.
A fingerprint expert from Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alfonsa Cana".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, last year, a fingerprint expert from the CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the Farc's top leader: "Alfonse Cana", through the fingerprint comparison.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working at the CTI department, this week the line was on Eliazar González, a man from Puerta Tejada, who has been working in the field of judicial research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at a town hall in Chocó, where he often had to go through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the bodies needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle and after completing the relevant courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin treating, i.e. hands and legs.
In the week when the operation was carried out against the aforementioned Alfonsi Can, Eliazar was told to take the clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night he departed to Cauca with a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he would have to identify two bodies and he suspected that one of them is the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world. Therefore, he was asked to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillermo Leon Saense (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigative team to the place where the body was located, he did not recognize him because of his physical appearance.
He had no brushes, dressed like a village in the given area, without glasses, much thinner.
The footprints don’t lie.
Along with the galton scrap, the ink and the transplantator and the light, Eliazar began to compare the daktyl records of the dead with the records from the card.
The eye did not disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was commissioned to confirm the defense minister Juan Carlos Pinzón whether he was really the highest commander of the Farc.
Search for stop
For the Daktyloscope from Sijin de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos expressed to Eliazar González at the press conference of the Operational Service against "Can" is very important.
Many people don’t know our work.
Daktyloscopy is the exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in deciding criminal offences.
In addition to identifying the bodies, these people help in investigating crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When they catch them, a lot of criminals present false documents or have no papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in a database.
The investigator told me that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house, because at this place the thief stood up to pull out a treasury full of jewellery and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to take footprints, but in this case we could get a whole-hand footprint and identify the criminal who was involved in several theft," he recalled.
Fingerprint can also confirm or deny suspicions in case of murder.
A man was found dead with bottles of alcohol around him.
On the basis of the investigation it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the footprint on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it cannot be hundred percent confirmed that he was really a killer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprint expert explained that from the objects the fingerprints are "strayed using chemical or physical reactive substances."
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used to take them.
Then the footprints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registraturu.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians currently, whose data is not recorded anywhere,” said a CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Just like everything that shines is not gold, not everything you touch remains traces.
However, if it can be used, appropriate comparisons must be made.
“Refugees” protests in New York
Hundreds of protesters protested on the Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to stand.
A large part of them waited for an order to clean up the space and moved to the nearby park.
The members of the Assassination Wall Street movement provoked New York officials on Tuesday when they tried to get back to Manhattan Square by a court order, where they were taken out in the morning.
Hundreds of protesters pressed on the Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get thanks to a court order that allows the "righteous" to return to stand on the table. The second part of the movement responded to the cleansing by taking the park in the north of the city, where there was another arrest.
“If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle elsewhere and we will continue the lawful battle to return to Zuccotti, both through assemblies and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Wall Street movement.
Bray clarified that the response of the “righteous” to the displacement of the camp, ordered by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg himself, came to the court, where judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent displacement of the site and allowed the protesters to continue to stand here.
In addition, the "rise" took another park located on the crossroads of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the fary land in the Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and arrested some of the protesters.Bray didn't know the exact number, but said he saw that the bonds were placed on some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the site. A delegation of religious representatives also came to express their support and also tried to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed. a trial is expected to take place on Tuesday, and during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters even dispersed and distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to members who guarded the square, which caused "some small clashes," Bray said, who condemned the fact that some police officers battle the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities to displace members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or to use "the laws that were published after the recruitment began, or to prohibit protesters from accessing the park with shops or other places they used before."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this court order, the city suspended the re-opening of public spaces and warned the protesters that local laws do not allow them to return to the tents and bedrooms.
The city’s high representative personally defended the morning displacement of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were arrested and joined because the protesters “broken the law.”
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the square because it became "a place where people didn't go to protest but to violate the laws and in some cases hurt others" because "some stores received threatening letters" and " neighbors were worried about the quality of their lives."
“The early cleansing was shocking and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people,” the movement’s spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “not respecting freedom of expression.”
The representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" also said they are planning to organize "great events" on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade unions to remind two months after which the protests lasted.
Pamela Anderson will present the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, he will appear in the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", a swimmer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of the long-term musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be Santa Maria in a special Christmas show of the Canadian TV.
The private television station CTV today announced that Anderson, along with the singer of sentimental songs Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear in the TV show "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a television show in which Anderson, also known from the internet home pornographic images, appears with his former husband, the engine "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Leem, as the Virgin Mary holding in the yellows a doll representing Jesus.
As Joseph appears on the scene Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently served as a moderator on the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen.
Krome Anderson and Peterse appear in a special Christmas broadcast on CTV Canadian singer Bublé, who married in late March in Buenos Aires with Argentine model Luisa Lopilato, and who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian at one of her New York concerts "the lick".
Japan returns to life after earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% due to household consumption and ends the fall period that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from the devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has faced since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government estimated material losses to $300,000 million, a wound that, despite the difficult global situation, heals well.
After three quarters of decline, the value of GDP between July and September came to such a position that it was possible to turn the side with definitive validity: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% annually.
The results of the second quarter - for Japanese tax year begins in March 2012 - also predict the highest growth rate compared to the January-March 2010 period.
The recovery can be partially explained by the purchase of machines that are necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Companies have increased their investments by 1.1%, expenditure will fall by 0.9% compared to the January-March period. This is the first decline after six months of continued growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based exclusively on the impulse that forces us to take advantage of the crisis to get out of strength or to restore infrastructure.
In particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to increased costs for vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Stigmatism
The toky was entrusted to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "rescue values" for investors who flee from the debt crisis from the euro area and from U.S. worrying forecasts.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak outcomes in July until September just to the rate of yuan.
While the markets continue to surround the EU borders, the Yoshihiko Noda government is cautious.
“We need to be careful about the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid increase of yuan,” said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are not really encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said the majority of the Member States had clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that predicts unflexibility in the world economy has shown that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
It fell by four decades to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone has even fallen below the average level of 100. it has reached the level of 99.13 points.
Athens repeats uncertainty
Papadimos says savings measures will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With rapid and risky border guarantees and the uncertainty that has regained, Greece is increasingly engaged in the labyrinth that leads to the outcome from the major debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "conformity" of the new transitional Greek government is given rather to the demands of Brussels rather than to the true belief of the political forces, begins to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100 days he received at his appointment will probably be short for their application, the chairman of the conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, stated that the new savings measures will in no way support and repeated his demand for the drafting of new elections on the expected date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that ends tomorrow with a vote on government trust.
The package of 24 programmes to promote employment, the reform of the official disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras does not clarify any doubts about his attitude: "We have committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else."
The Chairman of the Conservatives went a little far in his speech to the EU and the IMF. These organizations are intended to unblock 8 billion that Athens urgently need. But at the same time he said he will not support and will not sign any commitment regarding the implementation of saving measures.
The European Commission, already disappointed by the impact that Papandre's referendum games have caused, emphasized yesterday that its demands are irreversible: it will not block any aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main parties sign a "written commitment without doubts and as soon as possible."
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors from Troika will return "very soon" to Athens and will negotiate with the new government on what "he needs to pay the sixth part" 8 billion.
The Greek government has a little more to do.
Queen Sofia: “There are tools for progress and hope”
The Queen highlights the privileged position of Spain in relation to this kind of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position at the global level in terms of microfinance."
Queen Sofia today reminded that the country has become the second donor of the planet in the past two decades in terms of this cooperation instrument, whose essence is that "it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole humanity.
The Queen today launched the 5th global summit of micro loans in Valladolid with the belief that “there is no doubt” that this type of operations “is entirely necessary” to the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations until 2015. “In particular, it is about achieving the goals to a half reduction of the number of people living with less than one dollar per day, that is, the amount that sets the threshold of poverty.”
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly," Queen Sofia said, hoping that the initiatives and contribution of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capabilities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" to whom these loans are intended primarily.
“We’ve already achieved a lot” and “a lot of challenges are still ahead of us.”
The summit on micro loans is intended to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that will support "basic goals".
The aim is to ensure that 175 million poor families have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that 100 million families are beyond the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of micro loans spread to Spain and other countries of the world after "the pioneer of the idea Muhammad Yunus went on this journey," the queen said, adding that it was "a act of justice and the necessary recognition."
The father of this tool described it as a "admirable idealist who went on the way of fighting poverty." With his work she met 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get acquainted directly on the site with his loan policy.
The first global summit in Washington and the next meeting such as the Elephant Coast in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings I was able to constate continuous developments, the Queen explained, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned yesterday the title of "heads of the family", which she in Valladolid was awarded "the movement of the poor."
Queen Sofia ended her speech by calling on the participants to engage in discussions and seeking solutions, allowing them to continue fighting poverty.
“Ethical imperative”
The Foreign Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, said that solidarity “is an ethical imperative” which all democratic states must follow.
In this sense, she said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with the period of balohobyt, because this cooperation is a "permanent duty".
Jiménez believes that micro loans represent "a serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever, the governments of developed countries have to work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to become the victim of cuts.
For Spain, micro loans are one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on giving trust to the people to whom all the others close the doors. Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed the participants in the city that "openes their doors to the spirit of solidarity that is infectious".
The CDU proposes to vote for the European President on the basis of universal electoral law
Without serious difficulties for Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel held on Monday 14 November in Leipzig the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
The question of the future of Europe on the program was not at first, but it became only in the autumn, especially to be satisfied by the party members who consider the policy of the government today against the Greeks and tomorrow against the Italians as laxious.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission submitted by the leadership was approved almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates voted against and 10 refused to vote.
A few minutes of ovation ends Angela Merkel’s speech and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, a very pro-European finance minister, has not left room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summarized in the slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro.”
According to the Chancellor, “the time of change has come.”
This could be expressed by changes to the Lisbon Treaty allowing the European Union to strengthen control over the budget policies of the eurozone member countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of the general electoral law "to give Europe one face".
This is, in any case, one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: Britain is opposed and CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same position as well.
The direction is indicated.
Similarly, the delegates rejected with a large majority the proposal to evaluate the weight of each country in the Board of Directors of the European Central Bank depending on the weight of its economy, which obviously will result in the strengthening of the weight of Germany.
Leaded by concerns about calming the climate within her party, the Chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmute Kohla. but she did not try to get Congress speeches about "small" European states or about the states that are in trouble willing to criticize arogant Germany.
Although the proposal concerning Europe is one paragraph dedicated to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not regret France.
Only indirectly.
She recalled that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is a fraud in the case of unemployment?
After the support, the UMP party and the government are launching an offensive against unemployment.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 December, to visit the Social Support Office, where he will speak a speech on a repeated topic since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity.
As an accompanying of this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigidity, but is not less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on unemployment.
First of all, due to budget savings, the government intends to force private sector workers for the fourth day of unemployment before they begin to take aid in illness.
Clearly, without the company’s consent, a sick employee would lose four days of wage, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
Measures that are at risk of causing a lot of evil blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring €280 million.
And also measures that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic reach: to give public employees one day of unpaid unemployment (until now they have no unemployment compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the right-wing majority is also launching a fraud topic focused this time on malformations linked to unemployment.
“Controls will be much broader and in addition: if you’re found, you’ll be returned,” Xavier Bertrand said in an interview with RTL on Sunday, November 13.
Like in other cases, the effects of the notification appear somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about unfairnesses in unemployment.
These have in fact been the subject of continuous monitoring since 2002 and the political struggle that brought their fruits.
French people are not more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s start with some official numbers.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily refunds were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Healthcare, in 2008 daily reimbursements with their 11.3 billion euros accounted for 5% of healthcare spending.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity contributions and work accidents and 54% concerned unemployment, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
That is only 2.5 per cent of the health care costs.
According to a study by Alma Consulting, in 2010 the French had an average of 14.5 days of unemployment compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average that hides certain deviations: another survey published in 2007 on the job opportunities site Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed responded that they didn’t choose any day of unemployment.
Another study, this time carried out by health insurance institutions, clarifies that in 2010 37.8% of unemployment were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% lasted longer.
When comparing them to their European neighbors, French employees are not more than anywhere else susceptible to unemployment.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the CNRS (National Research Center) showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absence (for health reasons or not) oscillated in France between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in the case of unemployment represents only a very small portion compared to work on black.
When it comes to fraud, these are just a small scale.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 has led to systematic incapacity controls for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that at 1.5 million checks, 13.8% of 285,000 were carried out due to short-term inability "unlawful or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacities longer than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadjusted or unauthorized" were counted to 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132,000.
Therefore, a total of 169,000 "unlawed" cases for several million employees who had unemployment.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing the work in black.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this number would represent 9 to 15 billion euros missing in tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily compensation and thus endlessly more than the fraud associated with the latter mentioned.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke these words before Parliament, adding that a hundred days given to his government of unity will not be enough to fulfill this task.
"To rebuild our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new rescue budget plan," the Prime Minister said when he spoke his first public speech on Wednesday at the beginning of the debate to vote on trust in the parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken on October 27 at the Eurozone summit will be the "main task" of the new government, as the game is our country's participation in the eurozone, he added.
As a result, Mr. Papademos predicted that the country’s public deficit will be from now to the end of the year “about 9%” of GDP after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The EU rejects new savings measures
The right-wing leader, Antonis Samaras, on Monday expressed his support for the already approved measures to try to escape the debt crisis, but pointed out that his party is not committed to any additional savings.
"We will not raise the hand for any new measures," Samaras emphasized at a meeting with parliaments for his party New Democracy.
We have agreed on the reduction of deficit and debt and the fight against waste but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Mr. Ollim Rehnov, the European Commissioner for Economy and Currency, who warned that the IMF and the EU will not block the necessary loan of €8 billion without a written guarantee of all parties to support the planned measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he will not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the expert committee
According to the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians are denied death.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
The Canadian society lives with the idea of rejecting death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and make decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society’s extensive report involving six experts working in different fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Commission recommends the government to amend criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if such a choice appears necessary for a patient considered competent to make such a decision.
In the beginning, experts quote a recent survey by the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada was ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medication of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medication yes or not, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home, which the majority of Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to all of Canada, while in the province of Québec this number is the highest with 86% of hospitalized deaths.
As for the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to the conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide does not want to change anything.
According to experts, who have also undergone controls in all countries where such approaches are legalized or are not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that such decriminalization causes any abuse in application, i.e. in practicing euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons incompatible or disagreed.
On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday at a teleconference more than numerous cases of these overtracks in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Euthanasia is also done in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” explained Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians tend to euthanasia
Remember that according to an investigation conducted by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already expressed themselves in favour of euthanasia because they believe it will allow people at the end of their lives to relieve their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the life of elderly or disabled people has a lower cost.
As for persons practicing assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes toining or interrupting patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that the criminal law indicate that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Commission of Experts also requires that professional doctors be trained to respect the obligation to refuse treatment at the end of life without fear of criminal proceedings.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final calming already widely used in Canadian medical facilities, the Commission requires that it be considered as euthanasia when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain and that it is subject to the same procedures.
Recommendations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the Royal Canadian Society’s report.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of experts-signators of the report as "extreme" among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the sick in the final stage.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 years old could ask for help to commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the summary reports yesterday.
P. Deschamps also emphasizes that it looks like the authors of the report build the autonomy of a person above all the other values that form the social pretext of society.
For "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objection to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Canadian Society, doubts about the dates of the report concerning the absence of errors in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the U.S. state of Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus speaks of ‘completion’
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Bashar al-Assad’s supporters held a demonstration before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who with Russia’s support resists them and speaks of a “completion” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, a neighboring country in Syria, have taken a view in favour of President Assad’s departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was yesterday the first ruler of the Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "transmit power" in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the regime's military forces were killed.
"If Bashar had the heart of his country's interests, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," Jordan's king, a neighboring country, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish diplomacy chief Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts devoted to Turkish mediation with the Syrian regime undertaken since the beginning of the year were not crowned by success.
“Those in the Middle East who don’t live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey applies an increasingly harder line.
The United States rejoiced the "forcing consensus against Assad and the dishonest behavior of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are applying increasingly harder tone" against the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 pro-regime forces were killed in the city of Deraa in southern Syria.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians were killed"in shootings and concentrated shootings from heavy missiles in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country "goed out of the crisis."
He also responded to the decision of the League of Arab States to suspend Damascus’ membership, which he said was a “dangerous step.”
He added that “the complots against Syria will fail.”
After its decision to suspend Syria’s membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering the “Civil Protection Mechanism” and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favorably inclined to the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repressions of the regime, which he says is behaving "paranoidly".
The new Special Meeting of the League is called for tomorrow in Rabat to take a view on the crisis settlement plan, which was decided on 2 December and in which it was predicted the withdrawal of the armies from the cities suffered by conflict and the release of prisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the decision of the League of Arab States was "defective", while China urged Syria to adopt a resolution plan, while completely avoiding the support of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti Demands Time and Victims for Italy
The next Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti asked the markets for a little time to form his team and start implementing a program that will contain "offers" in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner talked yesterday with political parties before meeting today with representatives of trade unions and employers.
It should make up a relatively thin cabinet composed of technocrates not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti talked about an important program with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after a meeting with the designated Prime Minister.
House Chairman Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament to express confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end Mario Monti with the introduction of a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgi Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented on the nervousness on the financial markets yesterday and asked them for time.
In the "democracy takes accurate dates" as regards the preparation of the government and its program, he emphasized and added that he is "certain that the markets will be patient and understand."
His appointment as president was initially positively accepted by the markets, but concerns reappeared after the unexpected fall of industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should make up a team involving primarily the technocrates, although he emphasized that he would like to take "politics" into it.
He believed the new government will last until 2013, that is, until the date of the next elections.
Deputy Chairman Gianfranca Fini said that the new government will receive parliament confidence by Friday.
Mario Monti has promised that he will negotiate with extraordinary urgency and with the aim of making Italy "return to become a strong member" of Europe.
The spokesman for the European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the savings plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not its 2013 budget-balanced goal, and calls for new hard measures.
Confindustria business union chief Emma Marcegagli, who will meet with Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy"because a country that does not show growth cannot follow the deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, the former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence,"Professor" symbolizing according to the authors of the introductors"the challenge to seriousness" and"the other Italy", represents for Italy"epochal change" after 17 years"berlusconism".
The time of life of his team will be unknown.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place government bonds of 200 billion euros by April 2012.
Soviet scientists help Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used for nuclear weapons, a U.S. NGO specialized in nuclear risks said on Tuesday.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) and other documents escaped from this UN agency when identifying the scientist.
Last week, the MAAE expressed its "serious concerns" regarding the "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute widespread from the MAAE documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) had to work for three decades from the 1960s in the Soviet Military Research Center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he had to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he had to leave the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company had to lead him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia he was then working on the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, MAAE reminds "clear data that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one member state informed the agency - worked during a significant part of his work career on this technology within the military nuclear program of the country from where it comes."
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of crimes and crimes targeted against Muslims increased by 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence slightly decreased or slightly increased.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase compared to the procedure 13% in violence against Catholics, a 4% decline in crimes against Jews and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of “hateful crimes” increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47,3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After the decline in 2009 it is annoying to see these criminal acts and crimes rise again,” the Human Rights First human rights organization said, “the increase in anti-Muslim violence is significant,” the organization added in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered to be a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to cope with these evils,” he adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports on “hateful crimes.”
"Hate criminal act" in U.S. federal law is the inheritance of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin and now also sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of its followers, somewhat similar to its Facebook services.
The new "activity" and "name" offerings allow you to better and directly know the activity of other people who follow you or the people whose answers ("tweets") you follow.
This allows you to know whether they allow you to track posts, whether you log in to new accounts, whether you have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before it was spread to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for repeated dissemination of someone else's post, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre user) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately in their "tweets" differently assess the importance of this innovation.
"It's useless, it takes a lot of space and it's too similar to Facebook," writes @jemb123.
“The Activity function will help me better track some of my Twitter elements,” said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Registration of the Golden Rule on the Balanced Budget in the Constitution
The government of the large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to insert the "gold rule" of budgetary policy into the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid the possible reduction of Austria's rating by rating agencies (AAA).
It was the social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision at the end of the ministerial council in a situation where the Austrian public debt is with its 74.6% high above the maximum criterion of 60% established by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency was reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more on interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, a multi-chancellor and Foreign Minister.
Austria follows the summit of the Eurozone countries held in Brussels on October 26, 2011, where the heads of states and governments strongly demanded that the reduction of public deficit and the achievement of balance of public accounts be included in the constitution or in the law of the same value by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall every year by 0.75% of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and starting in 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of the GDP every year, while the federal countries, as well as municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The objective is to get the public debt below the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty in the 2020/21 years.
Strong only
Noda threatens new intervention on foreign exchange markets
Japan's Prime Minister Yošihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japan's institutions would have to re-interfere on foreign exchange markets if they should continue to strengthen.
"We will interfere, as we did the last time, if we find too much instability" in the exchange rate of the yen, Y. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, he only rose again to historical values, which on October 31 forced the Japanese authorities to intervene.
On that day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which has just recently overcome the record against the dollar since 1945.
But only since then it has regularly risen supported by the purchases of investors who consider it a "safe port" in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the European crisis caused by debt.
The dollar dropped again below 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic line of 105 yen to close to the levels that caused the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This outbreak of Japanese currency is harmful to the island’s exports, as it increases the price of the Made in Japan products and decreases the value of the returns obtained by Japanese companies from abroad when they convert them into domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and the wave of tsunami that destroyed the region of Tohoku in the northeastern part of the country, Y. Noda stressed, who fears that this costing of the yen will not kill a fragile recovery in the egg.
The third economic power in the world has restored growth in the third quarter (1,5% compared to the previous quarter) for the first time in a year thanks to the survey of the growth of exports and consumption of disastrous households.
But the prime minister ruled that the high value of the yen did not reflect "the national economy of Japan".
Japan's finance minister Jun Azumi called on Japan's Central Bank (BoJ), which began a two-day meeting on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the multi-governor of this institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, pointed out that the BoJ has already taken "suitable measures" suggesting that no additional monetary weakening can be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for Securities Emissions increased its purchases of state treasures by 5 billion yen (47 billion euros) and increased to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of the amounts it dedicates to the purchases of various securities in order to flood with liquidity.
The Eurozone:
Rates rise, stock exchanges fail
The risk of debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of governments in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
European stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, fall into negative expectations on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10 p.m., the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt has lost 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“With new tensions around the loans revenues of the eurozone countries that are in trouble, stock markets around the world continue to produce only a portion of recent profits.”
“Neuroscient investors are just too aware of the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets broker, quoted by Reuters.
The stock exchange in Tokyo closed with a 0.7% decline, which suffered due to market participants' concerns about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes focused on Europe and the exchange will continue only in the narrow corridory of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stable,” estimates Mitsušige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoši Investment Management.
This re-start of uncertainty about the future of the euro zone damages the currency itself, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The Euro is at the lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m. the European currency has the value of $1,3570 at a 0.4 percent withdrawal.
The currency, according to the brokers, collapsed after the CDU party of Chancellor Angela Merkel on its congress adopted on Monday a proposal that predicts the possibility of leaving the eurozone for countries that are in trouble without therefore having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond the 6% limit
The interest rates for loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning on Tuesday, the Italian 10-year bond revenues reached 6.85% and the Spanish 10-year bond revenues were 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates in the southern European countries, but also in France, continue to strengthen the concerns of market participants.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti strongly demanded time on the markets to be able to fix the situation in Italy threatened by poisoning caused by its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on October 27 at the Eurozone summit will be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is again in the intentional straight markets when the parliamentary elections are held in Spain on Sunday.
The rate difference ("spread") between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historic maximum.
Eurozone growth reports
Statistics say that France recorded a 0.4% economic growth in the third quarter due primarily to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected 0.3% growth.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised downward the figure for the second quarter to a 0.1% decline of GDP instead of stagnation.
This is the fourth quarter that concerns most economists.
From its side during the same period Germany recorded a 0.5% growth.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy Policy :
Facts have to overcome dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be captured on the basis of short-term balances or under emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural that the meeting at the election is an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will be successful only if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must rely on objective facts and rational data.
For now there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will trigger from now on to 2050 double the demand for electricity if we don’t want a significant part of the world’s population to get rid of important parts of life.
At the same time, there will be a need to face the lack of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity, and it cannot be forgotten that it is necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, which is a topic that is currently disappearing from ecological debates.
The accident in Fukushima does not affect any of these parameters.
And this is why Germany remains alone in its decision to refuse nuclear energy.
But this is not the case of Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find some other source capable of replacing itself, nor of Switzerland, which it considers appropriate to build only the last generation of power plants.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by restoring the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island crash.
If a German renewable energy model is sometimes presented as an example, reality is contrary to it.
Berlin’s choice will be manifested by the elevation of electricity prices, the increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, the sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
All of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The Danish case deserves to be considered.
The European champion in wind power plants, from which he takes 30% of his electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, causing CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, due to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbors will pay the electricity invoice by 40% higher than the amount paid by French households.
While in a globalized economy, energy costs are a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industry on the national territory, French benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant decrease in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would make the illusory beautiful declaration of the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of the purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of the French refuse to pay, as well as it is essentially not against this energy, as the public opinion surveys show.
Let’s remember that our country’s energy policy allowed to build a sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 follow-up jobs.
The strongly exporting sector traces a large number of small and medium-sized specialized enterprises to the international markets, creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France decided to leave the core, it would sacrifice a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises, and it would lose 6 billion euros a year that the country earns for the export of nuclear equipment and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while planned a collapse of its manufacturer?
When dealing with the energy equation, it is necessary to admit that there is no magic source for the production of energy, and that there is no devil source.
The development of low-CO2 facilities, nuclear facilities and renewable energy facilities by the French industrial group AREVA shows the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromised and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in the blood.
In the past 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious crashes.
The only in Three Mile Island occurred in conditions of normal operation and remained without human victims and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama caused the concept of the reactor and unforgivable human errors.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the disaster was the result of two unprecedented natural disasters that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take the lesson from this disaster just as it did in the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and German nuclear security authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR reactor represents a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all those interested in building a nuclear power plant consider it, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift offered to the competitors of the AREVA Group and EDF and the way to get the lead positions in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinery dominate the debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from different angles – the pollution of the police, the courts and the administration subject to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of the “land of human rights” by which France is proud.
Recently, it was an administrative disturbance, the subject of which were foreign students, which became up to date when the Minister of the Interior (see the Libération newspaper of May 23) declared that France "not needs foreign talents, walls and servants."
But so far it has rarely been broken down under the corner of the economy.
It should be said that in this area there is a fairly broad agreement between the left and the right.
In 1976, Jacques Chirac said that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million immigrant workers" and on the left Michel Rocard, when in 1990 he said that France "can't accept all the misery of the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the hordes of Polish installers on French territory was shared to the right and to the left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we aim to provide to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande limits himself to banality, saying that joint development will allow us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, p.
The reduction of immigration is hindering growth and damaging employment.
The concerns about the impacts caused by migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure to lower their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitute for French employees by performing work in sectors with staff shortage.
Low-qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees, and those most qualified in dynamic sectors in which education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Just as a surgeon will have trouble working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, these supplements between French and migrants cause the arrivals of immigrants to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri so calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% will trigger a long-term real wages increase between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high percentage of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in the European countries for an average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, one immigrant aged 30 will bring a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of €150,000 to the public budgets throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Sarkozy expressed his desire to come for the missing percentage of growth "with valued teeth".
The teeth used to reflect immigrants had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about democracy.
Democracy is a rare and very fragile product.
The European continent should remember that, despite the fact that it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced during the 20th century the tragedies of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulags, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Colonel in Greece.
Some people could believe that in order for democracy to definitively triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to make the choice and make it in the most direct way possible.
But it is already known from Napoleon that it was about the ease of thinking.
The universal electoral law, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not a condition sufficient and can become a "instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and power control, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just so and since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
Recognition of the error of the Greek referendum of the type yes will not have the value of double disclosure in this regard: the disclosure of the necessity of a great return of political power, but also the disclosure of the worrying feeling of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democracy have moved today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We can’t get anything if we demand a number of national referendum organized as necessary and disorganized.
Bianko exposed to the European absolute monarch or a jump with bound legs into the empty nationalist depths: what choice for the citizen!
No, we don’t want the knives of the gilotine, but a common, full-righteous, peaceful and continuous performance of choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal – nor would we otherwise know where to stop the list – because the crisis is in Europe.
It is in fact the whole Europe cheating against the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its inability and its lack of solidarity.
It is a whole Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are worried about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe – but it’s the whole Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty and with it each of its nations.
It is urgent to restore the management of the European project of democratic sovereignty.
For only together, Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debt, to get rid of market governments and to prepare for the future by investing.
The east of the crisis will assume decisions at European level that will not be able to be made without a complete democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After long struggling against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacquese Delorse, everyone today strongly demands a European economic government.
to be.
But thinking about it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be a new madness and a new blind street.
We need to take on a new stage of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to be Republicans.
The revolution in the interests was not enough.
This lesson continues.
We need to build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This will only be achieved by building Europe a more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
“Uncontact” chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the world chip card exhibition will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris.
According to the Eurosmart Cabinet, 2011 is expected to end by increasing the worldwide sales of microprocessor cards (banking cards, SIM-card phones) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most portable is the segment of non-contact technology, which allows you to pay in public transport or handle purchases by just approaching the card to the reader.
This year, 460 million chips will be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to continue to rise in 2012 (580 million units expected) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6,925 million cards).
After being long in the leak of the APEC countries, Europe gets the ground in contactless payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals are receiving them.
In France, the starts are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been issued.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour has released 2.5 million non-contact Pass MasterCard cards this year.
In order to rank a higher rate, it is necessary for banks to equip their clients with them from now on.
“Two major French companies have pledged to systematically distribute touchless bank cards to their customers in the future,” says Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Mobile Payments
But this is just the first step towards the payment means of the future: the mobile phone.
Near Field Communication (NFC) technology is now equipped with a small number of devices.
“They get delayed.”
"But their real growth is expected to happen next year."
“For 2012, we estimate their worldwide sales of 80 to 120 million units,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are getting ahead.
The Crédit Agricole Bank announced the launch of a test in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
Approximately 200 customers and employees’ iPhone devices will be equipped with a box allowing contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also Société générale announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its customers to pay by mobile phone without touch.
The terrorist front ranges from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the bonds between Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-term suspicions that there are bonds with the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Algeria Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria had "covered certainty" about it from now on.
"The way both organizations operate, and the reports of intelligence services show that there is a large cooperation between them," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two French people in Niger in January 2010 could help light the connective bridges.
After the AQMI members were kidnapped from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation carried out by special French units.
After the attack, French and Nigerian investigators had found a number of phones with chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the calls carried out leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigator is interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, which is Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to be close to the AQMI and the sect.
“It’s a progress, but we must undoubtedly wait for more convincing evidence before we begin talking about the operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram.”
“But it is possible.”
“We have been aware for years that the sector enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is manifesting itself more and more actively,” says Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has become more and more obvious in the developments and manifestations of Boko Haram or its operational procedures, which have since included human victims or increasingly complex explosive equipment of the same way of implementation as the equipment used by the AQMI.
Since then, the international community led by Washington has made pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems caused by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illuminated mystics of little interest.
Fast Success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the chaussa language means "Western education is sin", approves the establishment of the Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such an association has a rapid success.
The sect is politized and requires strict observance of the Islamic Sharia law, while its supporters begin a fight against the 'central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, the Boko Haram supporters become extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
The reaction of the government is the same as usual.
The army is surrounding the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the sect Mohammed Yusuf is arrested and killed in prison.
From that moment, the group is radicalized and leaves its operations in the north.
On Christmas 2010, a massacre in Jos will kill 80 people and another in the capital city of Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks the police headquarters in its first suicide attack.
And in August the local office of the United Nations will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now concerning all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda of Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and Iger, and the Al-Shabab movement’s Somalians operate in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new danger for the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé said that France is in a state of emergency and is ready to "transmit all information".
World by President Candidates
In matters relating to China, Iran or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry advance in simplification and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, manage the world with simple or even simplifying ideas?
When hearing the presidential candidates, voters could think about it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have repeated halastic statements and short guidelines on the issue of foreign policy, which is already traditionally a strong point for the Republicans.
Often unfounded slogans about China, Iran or aid to Israel blurry each other.
Mitt Romney, the best positioning candidate in the competition for the Republican's "Grand Old Party" nomination, threatened the Chinese's profession before the World Trade Organization and their accusation"for manipulation with their currency", which is a caring topic in America angry by the migration of whole parts of its industry toward Asia.
The worse, if this must include the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former Obama ambassador to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost retired in the attitude that "highlights" the emotions.
It required a hard but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who is on the last place in the electoral estimates, remains unheard.
The image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if the sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
“If I’m elected, I’ll arrest Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of disappointing in his duties to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, demonstrates a shy ignorance of documents.
Recently, he called for a sharp attitude against China’s military threat, as Beijing “proves to develop nuclear capacity” – obviously unknown to the fact that China has owned a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants attacks against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
Everyone is far else than the Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and yet won the Cold War.
They remind that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the urgent withdrawal of "boys" from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thus attribute him the label of a weak one.
But the attack is not easy.
The population is considering President Obama’s national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
Iraq has no confidence in the military intervention that leads to disarmament.
And with the arguments that America needs to be reconstructed economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama tells the right place.
Nord Stream, the new port of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream remote pipeline linking Eastern Europe directly to Russia and led by the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to work.
It must supply a gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to properly celebrate this event.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of states and governments, took part on Tuesday in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together control around the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
This new pipeline will begin to flow 27,5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas to Western Europe each year by the first pipeline of 1,224 km of length connecting the region of St. Petersburg with the federal country of Mecklemburgo-Pomorana.
The second pipeline, which must be completed by the end of 2012, will enable the supply of a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is the amount equal to the total French consumption.
And it is already reminded of the possibility of building a third pipeline of the gas pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this enormous building is a victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries protest strongly.
In fact, the Nord Stream will enable the gas to be supplied directly to Germany without being led by any third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are somewhat losing power: the possibility of pressing Russia with threats of closing access to the Western European markets becomes more difficult for them.
Warsaw most strongly expressed this when it did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet Pact", with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that it is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, with its support to this Russian project, has gained greater certainty in its purchases.
But it is at the expense of weakening Europe’s energy, as the project created breaks between Europeans from the east and the west.
Just five years ago, Russia managed to fulfill its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries with high gas consumption, whose deposits are approaching their end.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically,” François Fillon confirmed at the ceremonial opening of this pipeline and demonstrated at what point the big gas contracts are of both political and economic matters.
All this explains the widespread smile of the leaders of Gazprom present in large numbers in Lubmin, a gas supply site.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an important technical act.
The submarine pipeline is made of steel equipped with a concrete coat to be protected from boats of marine vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, it was necessary to avoid the mining fields originating during World War II.
“For security reasons, almost a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed,” says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal serpent weighing as 242 Eiffel bears, which for its entire length is not interrupted by either valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it when the Swedish were just a little willing to see the Russian state company as it permanently settles on their coast.
“In the event of a defect, we will stop the passing of the gas in less than 1 minute,” says Jens Müller.
In the case of intestine, the gas contained in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered to be unlikely for the builder, since the puzzles were designed so that the impairment arises once every 100,000 years.
The control of the gas pipeline from the outside is carried out by a submarine robot drawn by the ship, while the gas pipeline inside is controlled by the device that circulates inside.
This cigarette-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced to the inside of the pipe and is pressed by gas.
In the destination after all three days of the journey at a speed of 3 m/s, it will provide accurate information about possible deformations of metal parts.
The remote gas pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without any minimum repairs.
Gas circulation is easily secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the target.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
The leading position remains Gazprom, which holds a share of 51%.
It was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15,5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
The company has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
The Gazprom subsequently rented the company for a five-year contract, which can be renewed, all its capacity for gas transport.
“Gazprom will have profits from its overall capacity, no matter how much gas it is actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
The funding of the gas pipeline was provided by 30% shareholders and 70% bank loans.
The total cost of work is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for both pipes.
For GDF Suez, the investment costs amounted to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be returned, since the risk is taken by Gazprom alone.
The gas pipeline rises from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with borovic forests.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gas output gate.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the coming gas before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
If the full capacity is achieved, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - Branding Register
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to regain the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing at the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable with its black rectangular plates and its leaves sent white colors as if they were aged over time.
Moleskine, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, will then decide to put a new design but distinguished notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, takes over the introduction of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (leather imitation), which is for example used to adjust the surface of the layers.
This type of notebook was highly appreciated by writers and travellers.
“Moleskine has returned to popularity the old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leader of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to settle to 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is far from the secret production of the first years, when only 3,000 records were made.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to compile some artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook will take business as well as a student or professionals.
The image of the notebook Moleskine includes that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open spirit.
A small Italian company, which in its beginnings had 12 employees, today has almost a hundred and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notes to a bookstore and through the FNAC store chain to small boutiques in the center of the city, where he knew how to establish his identity.
“We followed the spirit of time and this need for new writing, through the stormy development of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened the exhibition"Tragedy", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Film Festival in Locarno, she also released new records reminding the leopard.
Moleskine profits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pensles, laptops ... The brand extends to a wide range of carriers.
Success that raised jealousy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the percentage of unemployed workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today is the 15th Week for the Employment of Disabled People.
Despite the volunteer public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed persons with disabilities is still twice the average, 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it crazy?
“No,” emphasizes Éric Blanchet, Chief Executive Officer of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for the Employment of Disabled.”
“The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable.”
“At that time, the percentage of unemployed was not twice, but three times higher.”
“There is still a lot to do.”
It should be said that for unemployed disabled persons there are numerous obstacles before they get to work.
These are older people: 37% are over 50 years old (17% in average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have a graduate degree and of 2.3 million university students there are only 10,000 disabled.
And ultimately - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in disabled people versus 38% in average.
In short, these are criteria that make the return to employment difficult and which represent the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, the CEO of the Tremplin Association, which was founded in 1992, to help recruit disabled workers.
So much about the objective brakes.
It remains unknown, ways of thinking that are developing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that the managers surveyed had a "low level of knowledge of disabled persons" with a "exaggerated idea of persons on the driving chair and mental or mental deficiencies."
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of employing 6% of disabled workers stipulated in the 1987 law.
The latest known figures, which come from 2008, indicate the status equal to 2.6%.
"We are now moving around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph responsible for collecting fees from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence is the number of “cashed” enterprises, as well as the paid amounts, which decreased between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 guilty enterprises to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law that increased contributions created a strong pressure on, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: “What Happiness”
Before Tuesday evening (20:45) the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match would bring to them.
We will not go so far to write that there was a coalition between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other at the tribune of Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard agreed shortly and well.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach gave his player only words of praise.
“I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country.”
“I want to move forward,” said the French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performance in club matches and national team matches,"it's one and the same, it's justified."
"I'm in Lille all the year, which is not the case with Belgium."
“I need to clean my brand.”
The gambler, saved against Romania on Thursday night because of this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "sweat".
It is not possible to forget the term “rejoice”.
Play against Bleus, which he encouraged since 7 years and in their winning strikes in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he said.
This necessarily contributes even more to the “special” nature of this meeting.
About that more, because opposite, they are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he reminds.
“We crossed immediately.”
“To be able to play against them is just a pleasure!”
Leekens also recalled “heroism.”
“The pride” to beat”match – a holiday.”
"The pride" also stated at the quality of the" neighbors" that France was a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna" again became a team of very high level."
“Laurent Blanc has done a huge piece of work,” he breathed.
Although Belgium will be missing at the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 in a plane with the French direction... Brazil.
“Our small Belgians will become big,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
“You’ll be aware of it for the next matches.” including against France.
Portugal is very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento starts with great optimism the match against Bosnia and Herzegovina (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
During the journey, the two teams missed realism.
“At the end of the 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubts. the Portuguese football team, which has been in charge since 2010, qualifies for the Euro 2012.
Portugal divides from happiness in fact 90 minutes.
There remains one match and one opponent - Bosnia.
Knowing the Friday result (0-0) in the hell of the Bosnian Zenica, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal had more than an hour of superiority, but was unable to give such a rare goal that would relieve him.
“It’s a good result, but it’s a risk, because we didn’t get a goal out.”
But at home on their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will go ahead of the audience, which should create a hot cottage there, even though the match definitely looks like "very balanced," says the optimist, but wisely thinking Bento.
"We are expecting a very balanced match, but we are completely convinced that we can get the top," the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
“We still have a 50% chance to be in the Euro 2012,” the successor, Carlose Queiroze, said.
The unresolved Friday match in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to give a goal and win.
An unresolved match can be enough for the Bosnians who also need to score a goal.
"It's a good result, which, however, contains a risk, because we didn't go out," Bento regrets.
“We’re going to play against a team that has great technical quality and has players with great individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenici, the Portuguese will be interested in developing maximum pressure on the Bosnian team from the beginning to "do not give them time to think."
This is a good idea, provided that this time it will be realistic.
