Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's already well established, but it also provides details that fossils are not normally able to provide, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's feather color was a light tan at the top with a pale carcinoid tint at the bottom.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur moths had no developed upper extremity, called the plumage, but had other features of feathers - plumage and butterfly - researchers concluded that the plumage was probably a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or display. The researchers suggest that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen shows feathers of an adult animal and not a chick's plumage.

Most of the work that was done was theoretical, but the software was written to mimic observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts gravitational pull on the Earth and causes tides and low tide, the Milky Way exerts gravitational pull on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is around the galaxy in a halo-like form, and it's made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a simple technological experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope that lists the candidate they are voting for.
After the officials verify his identity, the voter seals the envelope for the ballot and signs the voter's register.
Election laws in France regulate the procedures rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballots have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there were no envelopes on the ballots before the vote began and no more envelopes except those of the legal and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to act as witnesses at any stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

She's in custody awaiting conviction and trial, but any evidence could be corrupted since her picture has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in Britain, but the Scottish justice system works differently and courts have seen the publication of images as potentially biased.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that it seems that journalists are indeed willing to take risks if they publish pictures of suspects and so on".
The prosecutor's office, which is in charge of prosecutions, has informed reporters that no further comment will be made at least until a conviction.
The document, according to the leak, will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 borders in the Middle East.
Other issues reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement while the Palestinian Authority agrees to keep such a presence for only five years.
It is decided that the shooters in the additional pesticide experiment should be under the close supervision of foresters, as the experiment is under supervision and its effectiveness is being evaluated.
"In conjunction with the NSW Parks and Wildlife Service and the NSW Sport Rifle Association, we are recruiting qualified volunteers as part of the NSW Sport Rifle Association's hunting program".
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of the NPWS's Conservation Park and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting attempt received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Myrtle yesterday appointed a new nine-member interim election committee.
This is Myrtle's fifth temporary election board in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the dismissal of the former Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelli's response to the large-scale anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, were sparked by the non-existence of elections, which were supposed to be held as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, a problem that led to six fires and left four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple notified it of 34 additional cases of warming, which the company called not serious".
"The department's response to the Apple report's denial is very regrettable".
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency reports no damage in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 into the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Then the cameramen took the place of an elderly lady who needed a bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research the topic of preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that taking the hormone would accelerate the baby's fetal lung development.
"Shinhua News Agency reports that government investigators found two black box flight recorders on Wednesday".
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said Luna was the first queen of actors, my first manager.
"Dustin Goldust Ronnels said that Shilona was as freaked out as I was... maybe even more... "I love her and miss her...
Of the 1,400 people who responded to the 2010 federal election poll, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The incumbent Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those polled share this view, and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
In the poll results, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned because of his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to get over his pain because it's forbidden in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various materials and software in early February and the announcement came out on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water for Earth, along with organic matter that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
"He treated the rumors as political chatter and nonsense".
There's speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
"It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older, more ground-based technology to allow flight controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and give pilots more accurate information".
No new transportation and trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and ride facilities are not available on site.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be held behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was previously thought that the process took much longer, due to the marriage of the endemic Darwin's cactus (Geospiza fortes) and the large migratory cactus (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be shaped into all kinds of shapes.
It can be stretched on a thin wire, which can be turned and folded.
"It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts".
You can make an indicator out of cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) in the chemicals tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped from them (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with wet and clean hands, make a ball out of them.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a weird sensation and creating a kind of crust.
In the towns of Arapa and Muangodaru, there was a toilet with all the toiletries in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman Empire, the baths were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then transmits it back down, almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and mirrors.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways, and the biggest thing it's done for us is to give us a much lighter and faster means of transportation.
It brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pets) that eat the smaller animals that are much larger, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special role that every cat fulfills that prevents him from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, they live in large groups called swarms.
Groups consist of one to three adult male relatives, along with no fewer than thirty females and young.
The females are usually very close to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave very similarly to wolf packs or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats), and likewise are especially lethal to their prey.
Being particularly athletic, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group as the lions, tigers and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not like the mighty roar of a lion, it's more like a sentence of words that scream impatiently.
If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that the Ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists think that ocelots find prey and follow it by scent, sniffing the soil it's passed on.
They can see well in the dark using night vision, and also sneak in in silence.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (such as if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations from those they previously needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adjustments they did in the past.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new surroundings, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that they won't be seen as the same species.
We call this process homogenization, which means the creation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of our food is from plants.
Mozaurus was the super predator of his time, so he was not afraid of anything, except other mozaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with over 70 sharp teeth, and an extra set of teeth in the top of its mouth, meaning anyone in its path could not escape.
His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
Plus, it attacked any creature that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't stand up to it.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans did have strange or unusual items for celebrations, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called a manaman.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich liked to have banquets where they would be on their side while they ate their meal.
It's impossible that ancient Roman cuisine included foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered the house of God.
People would bring offerings to the gods and priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and the inner court was a sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special temple to God.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home wasn't that important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was in the open air.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just open shelves facing the street.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his travels westward he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen a national treasure movie, you might think of a treasure map painted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words of the original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776. The text appears at the bottom of the document, inverted".
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its history, the large card document (it was 29.75 by 24.5 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, it's probably just another label.
The defeat on the day of the invasion of Normandy and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by Vichy France, which was the French who collaborated with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragon".
Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a very large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin chibilis, meaning citizen, related to the Latin chibis, meaning citizen, and chibetas, meaning city or city-state, which also defines in some way the size of society.
Cities-states are the heralds of nations. Civilization implies the transfer of knowledge between several generations, a cultural footprint and a relatively large distribution.
Minor civilizations often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and without being recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no authority to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its laws.
And she had no authority to circumvent tax laws and tariffs between states.
The regulation required the unanimous consent of all states before an amendment could be added, and states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives often lacked.
"The Italian national football team, along with Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion".
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, volleyball, volleyball, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international events and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshū), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
"Because of the archipelago of Japan, it is often defined as an archipelago from a geographical point of view".
"The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when European explorers who passed through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which caused a change in traditional grain growing practices and the employment of Chinese workers in its rice and sugar mines.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1912-1644) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, relinquishing sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the compound have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was restored and the restoration continues to this day.
"For example, the most common still format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size in the late analog film era".
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, its ratio of width to height has been inherited into digital camera image formats.
"The dimensions of the 35mm format are actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high".
So the ratio of width to height of this format (in fractions of twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) should be 3:2.
Many common formats (from the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or close to this width-to-height ratio.
The rule of thirds, absorbed into the cutouts of ridicule and abuse, is a simple guide to creating dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in the picture.
He states that the most effective location for the central subject of the photograph is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into triangles vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound the nations of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
Her piercing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the central beliefs in Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had resided in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to wonder whether this principle was maintained.
Shortly after hostilities began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy proved effective, blocking vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated accepted international laws signed in a number of international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain planted mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its boundless submarine fighter.
During the 1920s, the prevailing position of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horror and horrors of war in World War I, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from occurring in the future.
"In 1884, Tesla moved to Arahve to take a job with the Edison Company in New York".
"He came to America with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor to Thomas Edison".
Ancient China had its own way of representing different time periods; each stage in Chinese history or each ruling family had a unique dynasty.
Also, there was an unstable era of divided provinces between the dynasties, known as the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the crown.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people dying in battle to sit on the highest seat in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Plus, after the revolution, professions were open to any man who wanted them, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This was true of the military because instead of rank being based on rank, it was now based on ability.
In addition, the French Revolution inspired many more oppressed working class people in other countries to start revolutions of their own.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this physical life. He often commanded a cave known as the Hira on Mount Noor to be immersed in deep contemplation".
The cave itself, which has survived throughout history, provides a rich picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave is on top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it at all even if you know it exists.
You can't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still in existence today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of many large pyramid structures built to pay homage to dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plain, or Giza Necropolis in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family.
"The upward archmark looks like a V and the downward archmark like a trigger pin or a square without its bottom rib".
Up means you have to start at the end and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the base and pull the bow.
The upper arch usually produces a softer sound, while the lower arch is more powerful and assertive.
Feel free to write your own notes, but remember that the notes are there for a musical purpose, so you should stick to them generally.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, age 11, and Louis-Charles, age 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forcibly resettled in Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowds forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a man in the crowd waved at the head of a Royal Guard soldier who was killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism for the occupation of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover a significant portion of the expenses and interest on bonds transferred in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the huge profits from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people will be the basic profit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The era in which the events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that lasted through the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The height of the Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally accepted to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, from push technology or technological command to a hardened sense that human destiny is based on logic derived from the laws of nature and their expression in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology progresses in a way that is largely uninfluenced by culture or politics, and that technology has effects on societies that are structured, not socially conditioned".
For example, you could say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed in an effort to lower the cost of car ownership.
The proliferation of private cars also increases the frequency of road accidents, leading to the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair bodily damage.
The Romantic movement contained a large element of cultural determinism inspired by writers such as Goethe, Pichta and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures associated with this geography arose, and these, thanks to their harmony with the place of society, were preferred over the laws imposed by arbitrariness.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its promotion as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 17th century, largely because the Crusaders returned loaded with gifts such as silk cloth and spices that were more expensive than the Byzantine markets offered.
During this period, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, the dress was deeply influenced by Byzantine culture from the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western European countries began to develop their own style. One of the greatest developments of the period, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to purchase clothing.
Survival agriculture is agriculture designed to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Survival agriculture is a simple, often organic, method that uses seeds preserved from the ecological zone in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Throughout history, most farmers have been self-sustaining farmers and that is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique because of the age, ethnicity, status, location and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture typically mark their membership by unique use of symbols and style including fashion, slang, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to learn from the sad, isolated cases of children who, due to neglect, bad luck, or deliberate abuse, did not experience socialization by adults while growing up.
"Some of the feral children were imprisoned by humans (usually their parents); in some cases, the child's abandonment occurred because the parents refused to accept the child's severe mental or physical disability".
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others, it was claimed, were raised by animals; some were said to live in the wild alone.
When raised by nonhuman animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (under physical constraints) almost identical to those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the skeleton method goes one step further.
Flawlessness is not a learning method but a learning aid that supports people going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Pygmies can be virtual or real, in other words, teachers are a form of Pygmy but also a small paper trigger in Microsoft Office.
Virtual skeletons are built into the software and are designed to ask, respond to and explain challenging processes that students may find difficult to handle on their own.
Children are sent to foster homes for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child in the world deserves to grow up in an environment that isn't nurturing, caring and educational, but they do.
We see the foster system as a safe haven for these kids.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide for all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were taken in the past.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and access to content.
"For example, it has been argued that learning and social interaction are important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995)".
"Personal engagement and lasting relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and Mockard (1998) when studying audience responses to websites".
The use of video imaging has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last several thousandths of a second.
And specifically, it was claimed that you can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his speech essay, noted how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately assess honesty.
He even suggested that such abilities in analyzing human behavior were also common to animals like domesticated dogs.
Studies from the 20th century showed that there are two reservoirs of genetic diversity: latent and explicit.
A mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection erases it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and re-combination mix the differences back and forth between the two reservoirs with each generation.
In the savannah, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most available plant resources were the available proteins in the soil and in the microorganisms, but for primates like us, it's hard to digest unless it's cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a large amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
"Given all the data, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees use in the savannah today".
Sleep interruption is a process of deliberately jumping during your normal sleep time and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without completely waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting your watch in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythmosis involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as urine) before bed, forcing the elderly to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of stress in a person's body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force.
The only thing that separates him from our goals is our stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but this was expanded by the Mahayana way of love and by many techniques from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With the help of Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and imagination.
Through the visual thought of various divine beings, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
"Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Arabs.
Within two years of the war's end, the former allies had become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
"It took place over the next 40 years and the actual fighting was carried out by armies through messengers, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places".
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses had been broken, and the only chance was to retreat and rearrange along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to move goods is the most efficient way in the Great Divide to move large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country can keep moving your people and your products, while disrupting the ability of the enemy to move its people and its products.
One of the most prominent recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to move people and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, which used mostly submarines, tried to stop this movement.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in taking Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats first appear to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, fur, meat and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who in many cases were children or teenagers, similar to the more familiar shepherd. These husbandry methods are still in use today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriageways were constructed of only parallel wooden supports, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the era.
Crosslinks were introduced early enough to hold the rails in place, but it gradually became apparent that rails would be more efficient if they had a strip of iron on top.
It became a common practice, but the iron played even more on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known form of mobility was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, didn't walk upright as often as they did.
The ability to walk on two legs was found in the fossil of Australopithecus from 3.9 to 4.2 million years ago, although the sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be environmental activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, it's just like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and we need to neutralize it.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot because of humanity's scientific and technological progress, and the problems have been exacerbated by humanity's population density and dispersed lifestyle.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house, a few blocks away.
"Over the course of the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap sheets".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives today.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But a lot of things in birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their back legs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one or two values, i.e., 0 or 1, these numbers are referred to as binary numbers  or bits, according to professional computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so general that they do not allow for immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine box or bottles of household chemicals.
You should check the label for first aid instructions specific to this poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient familiarity of bed bugs, which are insects that have largely adapted to parasitic relationships with humans.
Both bed bugs and bed bugs are nest keepers who have adapted to living in a host's nest or house.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), so it's still the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to be hit in the spinal cord.
Couples may decide it's not in their best interest, or their child's best interest, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to have an adoption program for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can be the child's parents.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works by using the scientific method. This method guides, in fact, most scientific research.
But it's not the only one - experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guides scientific research.
"Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Latin Bible".
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have noticed rhythms in physiology and behavior, which often depend critically on the presence of internal cycles, and on their formation by biological clocks.
Cyclical rhythms, not just responses to external time signals, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue for a period of time in regular cycles even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading claims that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where we tagged the DNA in the phage with radioactive nitrogen or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the stem cells of the germline can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who wish to visit natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife.
Examples of activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small rural towns in cars to go to work and pass other people who will take them back to where they just left.
In this dynamic transportation vehicle, everyone is in some way connected and supports a private car-based transportation system.
Science now says that this massive carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is involved in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems bring up such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are simple transportation engineers unskilled? Or is something more substantial going on there?
Traffic flow is the field of study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to stay within a consistent range of logic; therefore, traffic flow generally has a logical consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, let's relate the three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects enjoy the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the spiders and the flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite was true; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the sun (and other stars).
It makes sense, because we don't feel the Earth move, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it flows eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
20 percent of the water that pours into the oceans from the earth's tunnels comes from the Amazon.
"The central Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers".
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, no structure surpassed the Giza pyramids in size and construction excellence.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous country.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in its legislation and official media.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the country, while Latin is used for religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, as all of these can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, developed the theory that everything was made up of one or more of the four elements.
It was more like the four states of matter accumulation (in that order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also claimed that they also become new materials to create what we see.
Alloy is simply a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You can also make alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them can fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
So, from the beginning, the pencil was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil's status declined and its use declined.
People today type messages on computer screens, and they never have to go near the punch.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something new comes along.
The fusion bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a mountain.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no momentum.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust.
"The thickness of the crust is about 70 km at the near side and 100 km at the far side".
It's thinner under the dead and thicker under the deceived.
There may be more lunar moons on the near side because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the heart to surface.
Content theories focus on finding the one thing that motivates people or charms them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they reinforce as they grow older.
These theories examine what is in certain people that makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
"Generally, both behaviors can break out when people become the bosses of their former colleagues.
This kind of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, making disciplinary actions, performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and demanding people to be responsible.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes unrecognizable and feels he or she must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often ends in rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups are required to the same professional standards as regular groups, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as liaisons with their immediate physical team.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not be understandable to their local management.
"The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
"The invisible team is the management team to which all the team members are subject. The invisible team sets the standards for every team member".
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization?
When all the resources available to all functional departments of an organization are used efficiently, creativity and resourcefulness can emerge.
As a result, a process of organizing workers together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that serves the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, so it narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides us with a lot of information and material that we need to build blood models, which help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and time management, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, in addition to handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Things like this have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
It is commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military. It has also been installed in a number of home computer and video game software.
Tours play a big role in every classroom. Often a teacher will be happy to take her students to places where there is no bus access.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips, where students can look at museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or gaze at beautiful art while sitting next to their classmates.
Sharing a virtual tour together is also a great way to observe the trip and share future class experiences.
For example, every year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept online to serve as a memoir.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy punctuation, audience attendance often changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
"Blogging also forces students to become more aware of the world around them. The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004)".
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, encouraging students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"Appropriate use of blogs may empower students to be more analytical and critical; through active response to online material, students can define their own position in the context of others' writing, as well as form their own point of view on certain issues (Oraver, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, and it has a variety of galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south of there are Niagara Falls and to the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muscogee County and beyond.
All of this and more make Ontario seem like a stranger to a typical Canadian city.
Large areas north of there are relatively sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness areas.
"A comparison of populations that surprises many: the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens".
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest by a large margin, and a continent unto itself in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states, or associated with France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it gained a wide hold in the Comoros and Mi'ut.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, with the discovery of the Cape Route from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
To the north the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that every traveler say she is married, regardless of actual marital status.
It's also advisable to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can cause what they would have considered harassment, and that it's not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their arm, etc.
There have been attacks on men's rejection, and don't be afraid to stand up for yours.
"The modern town of Casablanca was founded by barbarian fishermen in the tenth century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa".
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Bayda and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the ancient country it's easy to find places that sell traditional Marokkan items, like Tajins, pottery, leather goods, routines, and a whole range of small items, but all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo far to the east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by an eruption of the Niragongo volcano that buried most of the city streets, especially the city center.
Goma is relatively safe, but any visit outside Goma should be checked to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nirgongo, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use a Buda-Buda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands".
Today, Timbuktu is a run-down city, although its reputation is a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the danger of desert sands.
"It was one of the main stops during the Henry Louis Gates special on PBS's Wonders of the African World".
The city stands out in contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has an Arab rather than African scent.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
"The park stretches over 19,500 km and is divided into 14 different ecological environments, each supporting a different wildlife".
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are two-day maintenance and entrance fees.
You may also want to purchase a Wild Card, which allows you to enter a selection of South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gave the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that tourists consider Rabin as a major destination.
The row of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a diagram of glittering bars revealed by the presence of Victoria Harbour Water.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, exit the island and head for the Kowloon coastline opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reserved land along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers saw themselves as belonging, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
"The Sundarbans is the world's largest free-ranging mangrove belt, stretching from the coast for 80 kilometers (50 miles) into the interior of Bangladesh and India".
"The Sundarbans Forest has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park".
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remnants of the great jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
"The Sundarbans forest stretches for 3,850 km, of which about a third is covered by water areas or grassy swamps".
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses leave the Inter-Regional Bus Station (across the river) during the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jacquer/Boumtang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Because inter-provincial buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of travel to nearby destinations, such as Faro (150 Nm Bhutan) and Punakha (200 Nm Bhutan).
The Avevoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Avevoque River to connect the cities of Avevoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Avevoque in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two lanes 3.5 meters wide.
The minimum height under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, so Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be ready.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chako region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycoru and the Piyagua, who survived by hunting, trapping and fishing.
"Seventeenth-century Paraguay, formerly called the Great Province of the Indies, was born from a meeting between Spanish colonists and indigenous groups".
The Spanish began a three-century-long colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and its players who are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Canitas Polo Grounds.
You can also see smaller tournaments and games here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and places to buy tickets to polo games, search the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) whose value is defined as equal to one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will be accepted on the way anywhere on the islands and inside Stanley credit cards and US dollars will often be accepted as well.
Credit cards are not likely to be accepted on remote islands, although British and U.S. money may be accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so when it's summer, it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical area; temperatures of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the heater shows.
"There are no defined rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains stable throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you must keep at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wildlife!
No matter how comfortable they look, buffalo, Canadian deer, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they didn't keep their distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so don't get on your body or cook scented food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
"The harbour was the site of a famous naval conflict from 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour".
All the ships were sunk except one British cruiser, nearly 200 Germans and Englishmen lost their lives.
During the Maoist-organized struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the city led to the assassination of Supreme Leader Topo Tamasha III of Liape.
There are many beaches, as Auckland stretches across two harbors.
The North Shore beaches are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are safe beaches for swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutokawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Liars in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded with a great variety of shops along the beach.
"The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing.
There are plenty of French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more resistant to travel.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but for those who are apprehensive, mineral water bottles are very easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of 'flat white' coffee is unfamiliar. Short black is espresso, cappuccino comes with plenty of foam (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is standard Belgian, expensive but excellent fruit juice.
Many trips to the reef go out all year round, and injuries from any of these factors in the reef are rare.
Still, take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish appear near beaches and riverbanks from October to April north of 1770 and are occasionally found outside these periods.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and avoid them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main breeding ground being in river basins north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the peace and security of having a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also save the invitation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests must first go through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to stay on site, and most attendees see this as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the action, you'll have to get in early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may have ended, there may still be areas at the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas for families with children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in the winter, check the location of the cell, because crossing the ice makes quite a terrible noise in the cells most exposed to it.
Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Typically, casinos go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are often unavailable, and not simply to find the exit.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offerings to keep guests in the mood and to make sure they don't leave the premises.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and any good gambler knows the importance of keeping a low profile.
Anyone planning to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On dirt roads with ice and snow, the friction is low and you won't be able to drive like you would on exposed asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to get you stuck can fall in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or wind-blown snow, or by compaction or ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted year-round.
Safari tours are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a headline for many travelers.
The term safari in popular usage refers to land trips to see the amazing African wildlife, especially in the sauna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment will allow them to be viewed comfortably.
Lions, cheetahs and tigers are sometimes shy and you can see them better through a pair of glasses.
"A walking safari (also called a bushwalk, backpacking safari, or jogging trip) consists of a walk of several hours or days".
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Certain events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a problem.
There are a variety of cancellation policies, but since the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are not covered until July 2020, the date set for the Olympics.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with most tickets priced around ¥7,000.
Wet ironing can help them dry out. Many hotels have a tanning bed and a tanning bed available for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If there's no tanning bed available, or you don't mind wearing tanned socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if there is one.
Be careful that the cloth does not overheat (which can cause cramping, or in extreme cases, burning).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, it's enough to boil water for a minute, in others it takes several minutes.
The efficiency of different filters is not constant, and if you have concerns, you might want to consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests unknown to them from their native areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, are not usually classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and tariffs in certain places.
Travelers who arrive in countries with high taxes can sometimes save significant amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section from Point Marion to Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Appaloosa-Pittsburgh Expressway, and it often passes through deserted and isolated country.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert: There are many steep steps, narrow paths, and sharp curves along the way.
"The posted speed limits are significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/ h) - and strict compliance with them is even more important than usual".
Strangely, cell phone reception is much stronger here than along many other sections of the trail, like the wilds of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are pretty good, and Bavaria, they're rich and varied, similar to those in its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pies are common. Apple pies can be found all year round while cherries and plums arrive in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain nutmeg, nutmeg and other nuts. Popular cakes are usually particularly well suited to a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich baked goods, try what are called according to the different regions berliner, pannochen or carfen.
Curry stew is a dish based on spices and herbs, in addition to meat or vegetables.
"Carrie can be dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid".
In the mainland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is used in curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But, when used without further description, the term refers to food that originates from the central and eastern regions of Central Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of dishes served simply, and the prominent flavors that Javanese people like are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
The rider's legs are supported by the rider's legs.
They provide more stability for the rider but may raise safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot gets caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse runs away.
First, most riders wear riding boots with smooth, rough heels and soles.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the saddle's skin to fall off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from the mountaintops. Climbers from all over the world are constantly building new routes within the walls' infinite potential.
Snow sport on slopes, including skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport based on skating down a snow-covered surface with skates or snowboards attached to the feet.
"Skiing is a major hiking activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called ski jumpers, planning a complete vacation around skiing in a certain place".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting people skiing date back to 5000 BC!
"Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians in Australia opened the first ski club".
Ski backpacks: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski tours.
It is related to but does not usually involve alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter being performed on steep terrain and requiring much harder boots and skates.
Think of a ski slope as a similar slope to a nature walk.
Under good conditions you can cover greater distances than by walking - but you will very rarely get the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on trails that are trained for it.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries requires going through the visa application and passport control process many times.
The Schengen area, on the other hand, acts a bit like a single country in that respect.
As long as you stay in the area, you can generally cross borders without going through passport controls again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, so we save time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is considered antique. Some taxing bodies define goods that are over a hundred years old.
The definition varies geographically, and the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products may be considered antiques, even though they are younger than similar products produced in mass production.
Northern reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood among the Sami and the culture around this hand-sending is also important to many other professionals.
But even traditionally, not all Sami were involved in large-scale deer farming, but lived by fishing, hunting and the like, and kept deer mainly as livestock.
Today many Sami people work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Sapmi.
"Although it is widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word gypsy is often considered offensive because of the associations it raises with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani people".
If the country you are visiting receives a travel warning, this may affect your health insurance or flight cancellation insurance.
You should consult the governments of other countries, but their advice is for their citizens.
As one example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel warnings are simply a brief summary of the political situation in a specific country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and overly abstract compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous climatic phenomenon that can cause damage, serious disruption of social order or loss of human life.
Hard weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of it, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and raging fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hailstorms, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal effects of severe weather include strong winds, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the danger of severe weather in the area as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be designated a war zone needs to get professional training.
"An Internet search for a hostile environment course will likely yield an address for a local company".
A regular course will include all the topics discussed here in more detail, usually alongside practical experience.
The course will usually last between two and five days and will include role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on wildlife survival are common, but publications on war zones are few.
Passengers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery in another country must ensure they have valid return travel documents.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without an X-rated or updated document to match the desired name and gender is changing.
The difference in the willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is no less great.
Security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people before surgery shouldn't expect to be able to pass through the scanner without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Backflow is the return flow of waves that break on the shore, often in a reef and the like.
Because of the underwater topology, the return current is concentrated in a few more deep sections, and a fast deep-water current may form there.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion, from trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once out of the stream, swimming back is no harder than usual.
Try to head somewhere you won't be caught again, or depending on your skills and if you've been spotted, maybe you should wait for a rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs earlier than culture shock (there is less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to a new culture sometimes have a hard time re-adjusting to the culture they were born into.
When you return home from a foreign country, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits from your home culture.
When you first arrived in a foreign country, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to new countries have to adjust.
People may not expect that patience and understanding will be required for travelers returning home.
The pyramid's light-sound show is one of the most interesting things in the area for kids.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the voices of the tourists and the vendors.
The sphinx serves as a backdrop and narrator for a long story.
The scenes are shown on top of the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the highest number of bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located about 120 kilometres north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Astrias.
With the others are Livingston Island, and Disappointment, where the flooded mud of an still-active volcano still forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern area of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellinghouse Sea.
The peninsula merges into the plain, then re-emerges to form the 200-mile Ellsworth Mountain Range, crossed by a Minnesota glacier.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, the highest of which rises to 4,892 m (15,830 ft) is Mount Vinson.
In remote places, without cell phone service, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Usually a satellite phone is not a replacement for a cell phone, because you have to be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is often used by vessels, including pleasure boats, as well as research expeditions requiring remote data and voice communications.
Your local telephone service provider should provide you with additional information about how to sign up for this service.
An option that's becoming increasingly popular for those planning a year off is to travel and study.
It's especially popular with high school seniors, and it allows them to take a year off before college without compromising their education.

"Finland is a great yacht destination. In the land of a thousand lakes there are also thousands of islands, in lakes and archipelagos of the coast".
In the archipelago of islands and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos of the largest coastal areas and lakes are indeed large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
A cruise is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for seven or eight people.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but beyond that it is unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most of the special cruises in the Baltic Sea include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
It means you can visit the historic city for a few full days and come back to sleep on the ship.
If you only come to the coast by boat, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some of the cruises have Berlin, Germany, on the banners. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fear or disgust of other things that many people feel.
For some people, understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during flight may help overcome the fear that is based on uncertainty and lack of control.
Freight forwarding companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Often, time is a very important factor when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Some of the routes to the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they were sending things by air, in some routes, unloading and clearing customs could take days.
The only way to get through this faster was to ship it as registered cargo, because airport regulations wouldn't allow them to ship cargo without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly business or first class is to pay a big premium for the privilege (or rather, make your workplace pay for it).
However, it's not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay for business class up to four times the price of a regular trip in tourist class, and eleven times the price of first class!
Generally, there's no point even looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A-H.
Airlines know full well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of reaching their destinations quickly and comfortably, and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
"In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment and declaration of the independent Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state".
Economic ties were reestablished between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and an excellent transport hub.

Please treat this site with all the respect, seriousness and respect it deserves.
Do not damage the site by marking or graffitiing buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of its inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost all speak Spanish.
However, most signs are written only in Catalan because it is defined in law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular messages in the metro are delivered only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have a reputation for being egotistical, arrogant and conceited.
"Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, still the best way to get along in Paris is to behave exemplary, like someone who is bien èlevè (well-behaved). It is very easy to get around the city".
The outward harshness of the Parisian spirit will quickly subside if you present basic distortions.

Rare animals can be found there, including European brown bear, wolf, owl, owl, spotted owl, wildcat, and giant squid, as well as many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and they must also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries do provide blankets for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own blankets, especially one of bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun when you enter.
In the same spirit, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
You can also ask the warehouse in the lobby, but the clothes don't go to the laundry after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all for men!
The Muroccan cuisine, like that of similar regions in the Middle East, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and makes extensive use of olive oil.
A popular and simple dinner, especially during summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available additive such as cheese, tuna etc.
"All nouns, including the word sie meaning you, always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence".
It's an important way to distinguish between a number of verbs and nouns.
This can be argued to make reading easier, although the need to find out whether a verb or a noun is used as a noun complicates the writing a little.
The pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to look out for are the C and the G, because the pitch changes with the movement that follows them.
Also, be sure to pronounce the r and therr differently: stealthily means expensive, while carro is a carriage.
Persian has a relatively easy grammar and is usually stable.
So reading this basic grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand expressions.
Of course, those who know Romance will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know little Spanish may be quick to conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it is not necessary to learn it separately.
Today's postmodern observatories are generally outdated, and remain as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to get to than those built in the modern era.
Most modern survey telescopes are huge facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching cherry blossoms, known as namami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century CE.
The idea came from China, where the plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the emperor hosted cherry blossom parties only for himself and other members of the nobility around the imperial court.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so refrain from picking even one flower".

There's a tradition of spending Easter Eve sleepless in an open spot to watch the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is very likely that it is a pre-Christian spring and fertility ceremony.
More traditional churches in many cases hold Easter Eve services on Easter weekend Saturday evenings, and congregations tend to open at midnight for the celebration of Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of its great distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since man arrived on the Galapagos, many mammals have been brought to the island, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the North or South Pole in the winter you will experience a polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
