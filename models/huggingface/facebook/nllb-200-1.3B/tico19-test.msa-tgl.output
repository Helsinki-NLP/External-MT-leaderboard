The rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, although at different levels depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in all countries.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the increasing number of patients with COVID-19 who will require healthcare, and in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

Since then, the disease resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Till date it has been shown that about 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild illness, e.g. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these patients recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolved into a more severe illness requiring hospital treatment while the remaining 6% of cases developed a critical illness requiring intensive care.
The hospital-acquired mortality rate for COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trend in cumulative COVID-19 incidence in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared those countries with Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK with those in Italy as of 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the 5 March 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 among those returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), of which between 31 December 2019 and including that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the count of COVID-19 cases reported in each country worldwide, obtained from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess the COVID-19 trend in the EU/EEA and UK, and to compare the data with Italy.
As a proxy for the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we have calculated the cumulative incidence of the fastest14-day COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural pathway of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK country, during the period 1 January15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases reported for each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 am compared to the number of cases in Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend in the latest 14-day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, cumulative COVID-19 incidence started rising around 21 February and then increased significantly around 28 February 2020 (Additional material).
This was driven largely by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, however all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar upward trend for cumulative COVID-19 incidences (Additional material).
Chart 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEA countries and UK versus cases in Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
It stressed that, as of 15 March at 8:00am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported the same number of cases as Italy just 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is rising rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed cumulative incidence trend for COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is spreading at the same rate in all countries.


Data on admissions of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, such data should be collected in a systematic manner to support ongoing monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The study conducted in 2010-11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
11).11
The modelling scenario related to healthcare capacity fracture, with estimates for each EU/EEA and UK country for the spread of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with > 90% risk over intensive care bed capacity, is provided in the sixth update of the Rapid Risk Assessment on COVID-19 by ECDC.
As cases have so far formed clusters in certain territories in EU/EEA countries and UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically handle a population with a clear area focus, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided in Tatanama for the regional units for statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and UK.

As emphasized in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from containment approach to reduction, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response appropriately if not implemented earlier.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health care measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity where countries have the possibility to continue to increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as well as reduce the pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, it is likely that the healthcare systems of other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing catastrophic human suffering.
Like its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of humans in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also have spread from bats and caused similar symptoms via similar mechanisms.
COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS but is more transmissible and affects more elderly than adolescents and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the newly emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive look at the subject of this rapidly expanding research.
We'll discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 and the related disease named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread to the rest of the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with over 40,000 patients being allowed home and over 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1" and has the potential to be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, over 2000 papers have been published on COVID-19 including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first report on 7 January 2020 determining the concentration of virus isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to summarize the research progress in this new and rapidly developing subject area.
Where appropriate, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, originated in 2012).
We will also discuss what we know so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease and some other important questions.
CoVs have traditionally been considered harmless pathogens to humans, typically causing about 15% of common influenza 4.
Though, in this century, we have twice discovered highly pathogenic human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the outbreak of outbreaks respectively originating in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon after spread to many other countries with severe morbidity and mortality rates.
COVID-19
As shown in Chart Chart 1,1, a pneumonia cluster of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later the coronavirus was released.

On January 20, infections among healthcare workers were reported, suggesting that human-to-human infection could occur.
On January 23, Wuhan city was placed under a lockdown with all public transport services suspended.
On 24 January the first clinical study on the disease reported that, of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which is considered to be the origin of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the disease as a global health emergency.

SARS-CoV-2 infects patients of all ages, but most are aged 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected patients were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old and only 14 infected individuals were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is spreading in clusters mostly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The mean time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted RO is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, coinciding with the time of mass movement before the Spring Festival in China.
The rate of death in patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the rate of death adjusted for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Tri factorsfor COVID-19are gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, protective viruses that contain single strands of sensory RNA.
The virus can be divided into four genera, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, among all alpha- and beta-CoVs known to infect humans.
Spike (S) surface glycoprotein binds to the cellular receptors of angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
Genus RNA virus is released into the cytoplasm; after genus replication, genome RNA is accompanied by surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid proteins forming vesicles containing virions, which then attach to the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type beta-CoV with over 99.98% genetic identity in 10 targeted samples taken from the site of the disease's origin, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
ACE2 in humans has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2's S protein binds to ACE2 more weakly than SARS-CoV, which coincidentally is similar to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new simple proteins encoded by orf3b and secreted proteins encoded by orf8.
orf3b for SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and possess IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any functional domains or motifs.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., reported that the cyro-EM structure of human ACE2 is completely at 2.9 Å resolution in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has both open and closed validation, has been combined as a dimer and that the ACE-BOAT2 complex can combine two S proteins, which provide evidence for CoV sequencing and infection.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug filtration to contain SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and intermediate hosts
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS Cov originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through foxes and camels respectively.

The intermediate hosts that help the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes were carriers of the virus from bats to humans involving homologous recombination in S protein.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that the common ant-eating long-nosed mammal in traditional Chinese medicine is a potential intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology in CoVs found in the common ant and SARS-CoV-2.
The 1% difference spread across the two genomes is still a large difference; therefore, a final decision to establish concrete evidence is pending (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 45 days below 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The entire human population generally does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore considered susceptible to novel viruses.

So we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Figure 4).
In general, after a virus has invaded a host, the virus is first identified by the host's natural immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including receptors such as C-type lectin, receptors such as Tol (TLR), receptors such as NOD (NLR), and receptors such as RIG-I (RLR).

SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus avoid an immune response.
Soon after, the adaptive immune response also fr the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8+ T cells go on to kill the virus-infected cells.
Helper T cells produce proliferative cytokines to aid in the cell's defenses.
CoVs can inhibit T cell function by causing T cell apoptosis.
Immunity including complementary C3a and C5a as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from patients who have recovered neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overexposure of the immune system generates a large number of free radicals in the body which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst case scenario, multiple organ failure, even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on early clustering, is more likely to affect older adults with comorbidities and pregnant women.
As is normal for those who are exposed to large numbers of viruses or whose immune function is impaired, they have a higher chance of being infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, typically 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
Though, studies of 1,099 cases have shown that the incubation period is 3 days on average and ranges from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as noted above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is important for health authorities to adjust effective quarantine time based on the most accurate containment period, while preventing those who are infected but have no symptoms from spreading the virus to others.
As a general practice, individuals who are exposed to, or infected by, the virus usually need to quarantine for 14 days.
Do you think the quarantine should be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and early symptom for COVID-19, which can be accompanied without other symptoms or symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia within a week of onset of disease.
In severe cases, the patient's condition rapidly progresses to acute respiratory syndrome, septic reflux, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormality of pulmonary imaging, should be screened for virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the symptom percentage was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients require respiratory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of family clusters and clusters caused by spread from asymptomatic individuals.
In comparison, demographic studies in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
80% of them need respiratory assistance, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with higher incidence by MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) are the main symptoms and respiratory assistance has been required for about 14%-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2% as confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, the death rate from SARS as of November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on demographic studies as of June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
The R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was reported as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, whereas the R0 for SARS-CoV ranged only from 2 to 4.
The comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and RO of the disease is shown in Table Table1.1.
The above numbers suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher infectious capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less deadly than the two diseases.

Clustering often occurs within the same family or from the same assembly or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients in the last two weeks before the onset of illness.
Though, it has been reported that patients can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks and recovered patients who are allowed home from the hospital can carry the virus again, which sends a warning to increase the quarantine time.
Patients have normal or decreased peripheral white blood cell count (mainly lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count < 4×109/L including a lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia have been found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin have increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation have increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the levels of D-dimer, the degradation product of fibrin in the blood, have increased, and the lymphocyte count has decreased significantly.
Abnormality in chest radiography is found in most COVID-19 patients and is indicated by bilateral stacked shadows or glare of clay in the lungs.
Patients typically have atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute difficulty breathing syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, rapid fluid accumulation and fibrosis severely affect the gas exchange.
Type-I and type-II pneumocytosis reduce surfactant levels and increase surface tension, while reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung failure.
So, a bad chest X-ray finding is usually parallel to the most severe stage of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis for COVID-19 showed pneumocytosis, formation of hyaline membranes and penetration of interstitial lymphocytes as well as multinucleate sincium cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, consistent with viral infection pathology and ARDS as well as similar to the pathology of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the primary criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to high false negative rates, which could spark an epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
Similar situations occur with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory testing and radiological findings are important as well as imperative for making an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang's group described a protocol for the use of CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique for detecting SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a dip rod in less than an hour without the need for complicated equipment.

Therapy includes current and potential treatment with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 usually attacks the lungs at an early stage and may also attack, at a lower level, other ACE2-producing organs, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.

Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary imaging technique used for the treatment of cardiac or respiratory failure.

It has been known that cytokine storms result from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines trigger immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals which are a major cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for severe patients.
Corticosteroid and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include T-cell directed immune response modulation; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blockade; JAK throttling; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppressor 4; and HDAC throttling.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids in high doses are not useful for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
In contrast, steroids in high doses can cause severe side effects, particularly avascular osteonecrosis, significantly affecting prognosis.
However, low to moderate doses of corticosteroids for short periods have been recommended for use with caution for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.

Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Remdesivir also showed the possibility of the spread of other single-stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS.

In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this treatment with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation

True, recovered patients usually have relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
Antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects and it identifies unique molecules in the pathogen and then directly neutralizes them.

their symptoms improve within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral load and increased cloudiness in the blood.
though, validation and explanation are needed to suggest such methods for large scale use before specific therapies have been developed.
furthermore, due to the therapeutic effects, some of the adverse effects associated with the plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for plasma is great to treat critical patients.
It's hard to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly to fight a global epidemic.

This way, we can increase antibody production.
TCM has been used to treat various ailments in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends heavily on the combination of various components in the formula which vary according to the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most effective components remain unknown or vague as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combination.

For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsule and the Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule have been found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients have been seen in several provinces in China that use TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which uses TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest recovery rates (13%).

On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study to compare Western medicine (WM) treatments alone with a combination of WM and TCM treatments.
They found that the time required for body temperature recovery, symptom relief and hospital treatment was significantly shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the rates for symptomatic conditions becoming more severe (from mild to severe) were significantly lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rates were lower in the WM+TCM group than for the WM group alone (8.8% versus 39%).

It's also interesting to describe the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of TCM treatment or a combination of these treatments if possible.
Patients who suspect or confirmed COVID-19 often experience intense fear of the highly contagious disease and may cause death, while those who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, infection symptoms such as fever, hypoxia and cough as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to higher levels of anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, various psychiatric morbidities including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicide have also been reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, can cause people to feel more anxious and guilty about the impact of infection, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.

Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and timely updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.

The direct-depletion vaccine has been tested in animal models for SARS.
The in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in elderly individuals and dangerous challenge models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection must be determined before clinical trials are initiated.

In contrast, sporadic and cluster cases of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to persistent zoonotic sources in endemic areas.

The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgently needed and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulties as a long period of time (average 18 months) is required for vaccine development and dynamic variation of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just shown a full clinical pathway in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without re-infection.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in patients with severe cases.

Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33)):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 is most commonly seen in the 30-65 age group with 47.7% of the patients being over 50 years old in the study of 8,866 cases mentioned above.
Patients requiring intensive care are more likely to have hidden comorbidities and complications and are significantly older than those who do not need them (at median age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patient outcomes.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more males than females (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as noted above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to experience acute cardiac injury and arrhythmias.
Cardiovascular disease is also a cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2 positive colangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is common to note that age and latent disease are interrelated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal lab findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been suggested as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and eventual cure.
The link between CRP levels and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been suggested.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.
The enzyme is abundantly expressed in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and is released during tissue damage.
So it's become a traditional marker for heart or liver dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: Chest X-rays and the progression of clinical symptoms over time should be considered along with other issues to predict the consequences and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressive drugs commonly used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
As high doses of corticosteroids have been widely used in severe SARS patients, many former patients have suffered avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for short periods in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic many patients have suffered from extreme stress as they often face long quarantine periods and extreme uncertainty as well as witnessing the death of close family members and friends of the patient.
It is important to provide psychological counselling and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 can multiply efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
Thus, patients who are infected in the early phase or in the containment period can produce large amounts of virus during their daily activities, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
SARS-CoV transmission is thought to occur during severe illness, whereas most transmission does not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.

The most optimistic estimate is that the pandemic will end by the end of March and the phase of decline will last for 3-4 months.

Paul Hunter, et al., estimate that COVID-19, which appears much more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., modeled the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in both the central and throat swab of patients who had recovered and left hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could be a recurrent episode like influenza.
,,,,........
Ebola was initially projected to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

A comparison between the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is provided below (Figure (Figure55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious through coughing or sneezing, and can also be contagious through direct contact with material that has been contaminated with the virus.
The virus is also found in feces, raising new possibilities for fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be due to nosocomial infection, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 healthcare workers.

The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of contagion is by wearing a face mask; both the use of surgical masks and the N95 respiratory mask (series # 1860) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from potentially infected individuals from spreading through ventilation or sticking to the surface of the material, which can then be spread to others.
N95 masks (series #1860s) are the only ones that can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions able to penetrate N95 masks; SARS-CoV-2 is nearly identical to SARS-CoV in terms of dimensional size where both are approximately 85 nm in size.
As virus particles can penetrate five surgical face masks worn together, healthcare workers who have direct contact with patients should wear an N95 mask (series #1860s) instead of a surgical face mask.
In addition to face masks, health workers should wear personal protective equipment to reduce contact with the virus.
Viruss can also infect individuals through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 face mask; the virus may have entered his body through an inflamed eye.

For the public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is advised that all residents wash their hands with disinfectant soap regularly, stay at home and reduce contact with individuals who may be infected.
Tri-foot distance is considered to be the appropriate distance to stay away from patients.
These measures are an effective way to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

The message has eased public anxiety, especially as the entire country is preparing for the Spring Festival, and it is not welcome to curb the spread of the epidemic on a minimal scale in Wuhan.
China's disease control agency might learn from this and make improvements in the future.
For example, appropriate agencies are (1) more cautious in making announcements to the public as every detail communicated affects the attitudes and decisions of the public; (2) more sensitive and reactive to extraordinary information received from the clinic than waiting for a formal report from a doctor or official; (3) more assertive in containing the epidemic than in pacifying the public; and (4) more frequently hold training to raise public awareness about epidemic diseases and test and improve the public response system on a regular basis.
The transmission of COVID-19 is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus which started in late December 2019.
n less than 2 months, it's spread all over Chinaand nearly 50 countries around the worldat the time of this writing.
As the virus is nearly identical to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also nearly identical to SARS, the COVID-19 transmission has created the sentiment that the SARS outbreak has been repeated.

COVID-19 affects older individuals than younger individuals and affects men more than women, with severity and mortality rates also being higher in older individuals than in younger individuals.
SARS had a higher death rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can spread the virus without experiencing any symptoms whereas SARS patients spread the virus in sickness, resulting in difficulties in containing the transmission of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
The results of the RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for COVID-19 patients.

This finding indirectly increases the risk of transmission.

Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genetic homologs are found in SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like SARS-CoVs, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 also originated in bats.
What is the intermediate species that spreads the virus from the domestic, for example, bat, to humans?
without knowing the answers to # 1 and # 2, we cannot effectively stop the spread, and the epidemic can recur at any time.

Do the viruses also bind to ACE2 expression cells in other organs?
without a clear answer to this question, we cannot achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does this virus genetically evolve through transmission among humans?

The zoonotic origins of the human coronavirus
Mutations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its primary hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The SARS and MERS outbreaks have changed the way people think and revealed how HCoVs are terrifying and life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China in late 2019 has attracted attention to the CoV and surprised us with its infectiousness which is easy but less pathogenic than SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs can help us.
Most HCoVs are derived from non-pathogenic bats.
The intermediate reservoir hosts for some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human disease.
The investigation of animal CoV host interactions allowed for important understanding of the pathogenesis of CoVs in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of the existing knowledge regarding the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origin and inter-species transmission.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate HCoVs from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombination.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for successful host exchange and the implications of viral evolution on disease severity were also emphasised.
Coronavirus (CoV) belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of single-stranded, sensory-positive, enveloped RNA viruses.
The genome is between 26 and 32 kilobases long and is the largest genome among RNA viruses and is named "CoV" because of its morphological shape which looks like a crown under an electron microscope.
In structure, CoVs have non-segmented genomes that share a similar structure.
It is estimated that two-thirds of this genome possesses two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are interspersed, which are then translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
The polyprotein is then processed to produce 16 unstructured proteins, known as nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of ORFs for structured proteins, including the adhesive (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some clone-specific protein accessory proteins are also encoded by different clones of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), where the beta-CoV genera comprise most HCoVs and are divided into four sequences (A, B, C and D).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Over thousands of years, CoVs have outpaced species resistance and some have emerged as important human pathogens.

Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 which are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 typically cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, the newly identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, resulting in severe lower respiratory tract infections in patients who have a high probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from nasal swabs of patients who had the flu in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gathered through extensive studies regarding HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which result in self-control symptoms.
The concept was widely accepted that HCoV infection was harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003 and was one of the most devastating in history, infecting over 8,000 people with a crude mortality rate of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a continuing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
Novel HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, was the causative agent of the ongoing epidemic of the 2010 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-1), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 individuals as of 3 March 2020.
The world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from bats, mice and domestic animals.
Evidence supports the evolutionary origins of all HCov from bats, where the virus is adaptable and non-pathogenic yet shows great genetic diversity.
The COVID-2019 epidemic has brought major medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the rest of the world.
The zoonotic origins of HCoVs provide a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and limiting factors for the jump of species.
It may also drive and facilitate the search for reservoir animal hosts, intermediates and tracers for SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in preventing future outbreaks.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, inter-species transmission and pathogenesis for HCoVs.
In particular, we outlined and discussed the common theme where the HCoV virion is non-pathogenic in the natural reservoir of the host but becomes pathogenic after interspecies transmission to the new host.
We also re-examined the direction of the evolution of HCoVs where increased transmission often occurs with pathogenic reduction.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In the past few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) can provide information and instruction.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract germ infections in 1966, and subsequently adapted to grow within the WI-38 lung cell line.
The HCoV-229E virus is transmitted by the human genome.
Then in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequently serialized in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection is seen to be similar to infection by HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are widespread worldwide and tend to be more transmissible during winter in temperate regions.
Typically, the duration of the suppression of both viruses is less than a week, followed by illness for about 2 weeks.
According to studies on human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E experienced a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients showed severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, was the first pandemic caused by HCoVs to be well-documented in human history and its etiological agent was SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first SARS case can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province in China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.

SARS-CoV-infected patients initially exhibit myalgia, headache, fever, diarrhea and cold, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphophenia, altered liver function tests and increased creatine kinase are common SARS laboratory abnormalities.
Alveolar damage diffusivity, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages have also been observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
Besides infection of the lower respiratory tract, various organs including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storm, which can be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
Virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of an index patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, much effort has been made for HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially found to be widespread in children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory disease.
The presence of cholera, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study reported isolating the same virus from nasal specimens of an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses and the peak incidence of the disease is during the early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.

Besides community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has also been reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbation.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illness.
All four HCoVs infected in this community have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic disease, although accidents do occur for unknown reasons as there are rare cases of the more harmful HCoV-NL63 subtype, which has recently been reported to have caused severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.

MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.

Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestation for MERS is similar to SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also experience acute renal failure, which is so far unique to MERS among HCoV-caused diseases.
Over 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, over 2500 lab-confirmed cases have been reported with a high case fatality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most severe viruses to affect humans.

The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Public Health Emergency at the International Level and has also named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been reported worldwide, with a crude case fatality of 3.4%.
Significantly, the case mortality in Hubei, China is 4.2%, whereas the case mortality outside the region is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, appearing as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhoea also occurs in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly escalate to acute respiratory distress syndrome.

SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more infectious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may have contributed to rapid transmission worldwide.

First, the timing and duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs found in the community (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 shows characteristics more frequently seen during infection by community-acquired HCoVs, including the presence of nonspecific, mild or no symptoms.

Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting pattern features for both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
In one sense, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of HCoVs found from the community.

Lastly, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.

It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 may be seasonal as in community-infected HCoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 features including infectiveness, pathogenicity and continued spread after through humans will affect the eventual fate of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
All four HCoVs infected in the community causing mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to all four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived past HCoV pandemics.
The HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and humans that have severe HCoV disease have been eliminated.
To allow this to happen, HCoVs need to multiply in humans to a degree sufficient to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that fight host restriction factors.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more humans are infected, the greater the chance for the virus to fully adapt to humans.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Over the years, four community-infected CoVs have circulated in the human population, triggering a common flu in immunocompromised subjects.
virus doesn't need an animal reservoir.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, on the other hand, have not adapted well to humans and the transmission of the virus in humans is untenable.
The virus must remain and multiply in its zoonotic reservoir and seek opportunities to spread to susceptible human targets, perhaps via one or more intermediate hosts and breeders.
SARS-CoV-2 shares similar characteristics with both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs infected in the community.
It is as infectious as the HCoVs that are infected in the community, at least for now.
The virus is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoVs.
Time will determine whether the virus will fully adapt to humans and spread among humans without reservoir or intermediate animal hosts.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, we should discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary hosts, nature, reservoir, intermediates and reproduction of HCoVs.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host for HCoVs if it has very close inheritance that shares high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The inherited virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the reservoir host stores HCoVs continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the host is usually naturally infected and is a natural host for the HCoV or its virion.
In contrast, if a new HCoV is introduced to an intermediate host before or around its introduction to humans, the virus does not adapt well to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source for human infection and play a role as a reproductive host by allowing the virus to temporarily multiply and then spread the virus to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoVs can become deadly if they cannot maintain their infectiousness in the intermediate host.
HCoVs, on the other hand, can also adapt to intermediate hosts and also establish long-term endemism.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveal that SARS index cases have a history of contact with game animals.
The study also found that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in the general population.
The lamri (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the live animal market were first identified as carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
This is supported indirectly by the fact that no more SARS has been reported after killing all the foxes in the market.
However, it has been reported that lamry foxes from forests or farms without exposure to live animal markets are mostly SARS-CoV negative, suggesting that lamry foxes may only be hosts reinforcing intermediates but not natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV.
Most significantly, given that 80% of the different animals in the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that various species of small mammals may also be hosts reinforcing intermediates for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of these appear to be dead-end hosts for SARS-CoV.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The bat is positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This bat and other CoV bats share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
This study has provided the basis for the new concept that bat hosts produce human pathogens.

The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from bat fecal samples is shown using bats, foxes and human ACE2 as receptors for cell entry.
Even more interesting, the serum of a recovering SARS patient was found to be able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related lineage for SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence homology.

The phylogenetic analysis places MERS-CoV in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 and bat MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, peptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequencing of MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to the virus in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
Till now, no live MERS-CoVs have been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and the closest family CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87% of nucleotide sequence homology.

Live MERS-CoVs similar to the virus found in humans have been isolated via Arab camel nasal swab, further suggesting that camels serve as a pure MERS-CoV reservoir host.
It should also be noted that generally mild symptoms but large viral decay have been observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV.
Infection camels release viruses not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral tract, which is also the route for the virus to be released from bats.
However, questions remain since many of the confirmed MERS cases have no history of contact with camels before symptoms began, possibly linked to human-to-human transmission routes or unknown transmission routes involving unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homologs with the bat RaTG13 CoV isolated from the bat Rhinolophus affinis.
In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the divergence in orientation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine a parent relationship.
It is possible that bats are not the closest reservoir hosts to SARS-CoV-2 but rather that a near-similar bat CoV is found in the future.

Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as the hawksbill (Manis javanica) may also harbor SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs.
This mosquito CoV genome shares 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with approximately 90% identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two sub-descendants of the SARS-CoV-2-like virus in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-binding domain (RDB) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In apparent contrast, the RBDs from SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite having a higher degree of genome-wide homology.
Previous studies of infected turkeys also reported the detection of viral contents from lung samples, which were later found to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used manual assembly and selection methods to generate a partial genome sequence that comprises approximately 86.3% of the complete virus genome.
We can't rule out the possibility that hawks are one of the intermediate animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 originating directly from turkeys due to divergence of orientation between SARS-CoV-2 and turkeys related beta-CoVs.
Additionally, the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-COV-2 turkey-associated beta-CoV.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, crocodiles and other mammals has yet to be determined.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Strong speculation suggests that the high-level similarity between RBDs from SARS-CoV-2 turkey-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective, sequential, concentrated evolution.
A proposal back in favour of recombination between SARS-CoV-2 related turkeys and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driver, re-entry occurs widely in beta-CoVs.
Research is ongoing on the direct zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2.
Besides the highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while HCoV-OC43 and HCov-HKU1 virions have been found in mice.
It has been reported that a bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American tricolored bats shows close association with HCoV-NL63.

For more details, current knowledge about animal origins for known HCoVs is formulated in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The HCoVs are also known to be highly pathogenic.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic cattle around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E transmission between species is vague.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Among them is the alpaca alpha-CoV.
some lines of evidence support bat-to-human transmission of the virus.
First, humans but not alpacas may have had contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat-related alpha-CoVs with HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca-related alpha-CoVs induce respiratory disease in animals of expected
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that alpacas acquire HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.

Alternatively, although bat alpha-CoVs are deeply ingrained in the HCoV-229E gene, alpacas and arapacas may be intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is the best example of species-to-species transmission from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
The original evolution of MERS-CoV from bats was known at the time of initial introduction and has been confirmed by subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that bats provide the virus with a species-wide interface for the exchange of genetic fragments between species and for transmission between species.
Longevity, dense colonies, close social interactions and strong flying ability are all conditions that encourage bats to be the ideal 'virus spreaders'.

It adapts well to these camels which have switched from intermediate hosts to stable and natural reservoir hosts.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
The sporadic transmission to humans is unintended and humans remain the final host to MERS-CoV as transmission cannot be sustained.

In particular, turkey beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in turkey.
They may be the end hosts for SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, similar to foxes in the case of SARS-CoV.
Some possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between species from animals to humans should be accepted or dismissed in future studies.
First, bats could be reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2 related viruses which are nearly identical to SARS-CoV-2.

Second, hawksbill may be one of the newly identified mediator hosts of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses.
The virus is transmitted to humans through slaughter and eating game.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is required.
Third, as stated above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that had contact with both bats and crocodiles.
The search for animal origins for SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Besides the different host types, three major factors on the virus side are also important in making it easier for CoVs to cross the species barrier.
First, they have a relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to single stranded RNA viruses, the estimated CoV mutation rate can be considered as "moderate" to "high" with an average exchange rate of ~10-4 exchanges per year per 2 sites, depending on the phase of adaptation of the CoV to the novel host.
CoVs have profuse exoribonuclease readings, whose extinguishing results in extremely high volatility and weakness or possibly lack of vitality.
Remdesivir is known to inhibit CoV multiplication through the activation of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the best anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.

Additionally, mutation rates are often high when CoVs do not adapt well to hosts.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate in SARS-CoV-2 appears to be low, suggesting a high degree of adaptation to humans.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic modification will render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in a short period of time.
Second, the largest RNA genome in a CoV uses additional plasticity in genome alterations for mutation and recombination, while increasing the probability of co-evolution between species, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are right.
This is supported by the numerous unique open reading frame and protein functions encoded towards the 3' end of the genome.
Third, CoVs swap templates randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a unique "spontaneous-selection" mechanism.
In hosts that serve as mixing vessels, thread exchange occurs frequently during transcription of CoV RNA.
Subgenome and full RNA that are highly homologous can be recombined to produce new CoVs.
Evidence of natural phylogenetic fusion has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus hosts interact with each other to transmit.
Besides the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with host receptors is another major factor that influences inter-species transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a special example, which also shows evidence of positive selectivity during the event of inter-species transmission.
Based on a comparative analysis between human and fox SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is suspected to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations in RBD on S protein.
RBD on S protein in CoV interacts with cells and is strongly selected by host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acids on the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as the co-receptor for viral entry.
RBD from SARS-CoV is able to identify ACE2 receptors from a variety of animals, including bats, foxes, rats and raccoons, allowing for the spread of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed as distinct from human and fox virus splicing in RBD and 4 of these were located within receptor binding motifs for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV fox possesses K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may enhance the binding of the spike protein interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, both amino acid exchanges may be important for the virus' adaptation to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same receptor cells as SARS-CoV.
30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein has the effect that the binding affinity of this S protein to human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, cryo-EM research shows this bonding to be 10 to 20 times higher than between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other co-receptors may be necessary for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
More interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different S-part.
There are many other HCoV receptors in existence, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and sialic acid teracetyl 9-O for HCoV-OC43.
It may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of this CoV in humans following interspecies transmission from its animal hosts.
Besides cellular receptors, the outcome of transmission between HCoV species also depends on host dependence and other barrier factors.
The difference in these host proteins between humans and natural HCoV reservoir hosts such as bats, chameleons and rodents may create a barrier to inter-species transmission.
HCoVs need to capture host-dependence factors and subvert host-containment factors for successful interspecies transmission.
In this case, the molecular determinants in the critical areas of these viral interactions have not yet been identified and characterized.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Novel HCoV emergence: back to the beginning
The diversity of bat CoVs provides a wide opportunity for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this respect, bat CoVs act as the HCoV gene pool.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
For example, the acquisition or loss of a gene encoding a novel protein has the potential to drastically alter viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adapting to humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been isolated but found to encode the ORF8 protein that replicates.
SARS-CoV-29 nucleotide-deactivation characteristics were found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This blackout separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered to be an adaptation mutation that promotes host exchange.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gamma CoV lineages, of which a large number of smaller recombination regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
The recombination site has also been identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and part of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been shown to experience a recombination event between different strains, which occurs in Arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, re-combination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, which saw HCoVs re-combine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that false selection can contribute to unintended changes in the viral genome, which are most likely the result of freeing the virus from imposed selection stress, such as by the host immune system.
One example of this effect is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, due to the blackout of two nucleotides.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Lastly, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by selective stress in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms have been detected when bats are infected with CoV, marking a co-adaptation between CoV and bats.
It appears that bats adapt well to the CoVs both anatomically and psychologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats was suppressed due to increased binding of NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell receptors and low levels of expression for the class 1 molecule of the major histokereserase complex.
Furthermore, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the bat's high metabolic activity can both inhibit CoV multiplication and affect profuse readings by exoribonucleases, while also providing selective pressure for the care of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced to new hosts.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein traits for host adaptation.

CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
It multiplies rapidly without triggering a strong host immune response.
THE COURT OF THE SYSTEMATIC CAREER
The severe symptoms are mostly due to the hyper-activation of the immune response and the cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the worse the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been offset from CoV multiplication.
The same strategy that unleashes the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is very strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type 1 interferon at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
Additionally, inflammasome activation in bats is ineffective.
For this reason, the NLRP3 inflammasome enhancement with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 followed a common theme of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

Tengkulak beta-CoVs that are highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that the dengkulak may be one of the intermediate hosts or that the dengkulak beta-CoVs may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.

CoVs have returned to the spotlight following the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has drastically changed our view of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs for HCoVs in human transmission.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
As SARS-CoV infection originates from human-to-human contact with foxes in the market, closing wet markets and killing foxes should effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, turkeys should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, due to the discovery of multiple turkeys beta-CoV lineages closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
The weather and the way SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans via ticks and other mammals need to be explained in future investigations.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been present in the Arabian camel for a long time.

The camel is found throughout the Middle East and Africa.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
To prevent the re-transmission of the MERS outbreak, a holistic approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, combined with other infection control measures.
nce we can't get rid of this virus, new genotypes might appear to cause epidemics.
Zooonotic CoVs are spreading in the woods.
Especially, bat CoVs with highly diverse zoonotic potential.
There is a lot of chance for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or potentially lethal in humans in the future.
The practice of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be stopped to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparations and response plans should be made.
nfact,manyviruseshavebeen on this planet for a long time.
The virus stays in its natural reservoir until it has a chance to spread.

Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to stay away from the ecological natural reservoir for zoonotic viruses.

First, if bats transmit the inherited SARS-CoV-2 virus to crocodiles, it would be interesting to see how bats and crocodiles might share the same ecological niche.
e pae,e paeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, the way it interacts with different species including humans, bats and crocodiles needs to be explained.
Lastly, as many mammals including exotic animals may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be conducted.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Continued investigation in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.

2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we have responded to a review of our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspect case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest (seventh version) COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-10 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed rapid advice guidelines and the guidelines have been published in the Medical Health Research paa 06 February 2020.
The guide has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
Please note however that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasing slowly based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies should be continuously updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts substantially modified.
Our guidelines received a review by Zhou et al., who introduced a simple scoring recommendation based on their clinical experience.
their efforts add new evidence to our guidelines and also become a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We recognize their important efforts and thank them.
However, their efforts also require updating in line with the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh trial edition) and the latest studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case requires a combination of either one item of epidemiological history characteristics with two items of clinical manifestation to produce a comprehensive analysis, or it must meet three items of clinical manifestation if without a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) History of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days before symptom onset; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 case infection (with positive nucleic acid testing); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 has been reported within 14 days before symptom onset; (4) history of contact with confirmed case clusters.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases with any of the following pathogenic items or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) virus-wide genome sequence showing high homogeneity to known novel coronavirus; (3) positive for IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing; or exchange of SaRS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies from negative to positive, or titer increase of > 4 fold in the recovery phase over the acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acids in respiratory tract or blood samples has been added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogenic detection from blood samples was included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); and then serological evidence was included in the seventh edition.
The modification is based on the ongoing work of researchers who are looking for the optimal nucleic acid detection kit for immediate detection, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood samples, which enhance the availability of different specimens, and support bringing specific antibody positive results into the already validated criteria.
Plus, there's a growing body of evidence that warns us to be wary of typical symptomatic or asymptomatic patients.
The flow chart from Zhou et al. should therefore be updated, as they classify individuals without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be validated in further practice and clinical studies.
As a conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will come along and invite readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend tracing and following the new guidelines of their country of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest daily number
Twas, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths on the same day.
This is the highest number of deaths per day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Studies (IEDCR) reported a total of recorded infections including 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who are sitting at home.
17 fatalities have been recorded.
In an online news release, IEDCR director, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the fatalities included four men and a woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases are over 60, two of which are 51 and 60, and 41-50 years old.
He also said the two victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID 19 to be a pandemic on 11 March.
Hospital officials told a local news source, Anadolu Agency that one of the sick was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait's Maitree Hospital.


transporting essential goods - medicines, oil and food - is still allowed.
The first recorded COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on 8 March, in two people returning from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, all three have recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million infections worldwide.

At least 52 000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, the pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
This milestone comes on the same day Malawi confirmed the first coronavirus infection and Zambia had the first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claims, as of Thursday, to be among the few countries free from coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours leading up to 10am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, over 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, contributing to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reports, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, over 1,000 deaths in the US on Wednesday from the coronavirus infection.
Throughout the world, countries are announcing tighter measures to stop the epidemic from spreading.


The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the emergency to 15 days; the vote was passed with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions, and one abstention.

Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order
Australia shops lowered their toilet paper limit once they made a deal.
On Sunday and Saturday nights, Australian retail chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase restrictions on toiletries to two and one pack once transaction respectively in all stores nationwide.
Aldi also introduced a one-pack limit, on Monday.
This limit was posted as a message on the checklist, and on the chain's Facebook page.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one parcel per order.
This change followed the four-pack restrictions for each transaction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in a media release on 8 March, reported that with the implementation of the four-pack ban, "many stores are still out of stock within an hour of delivery", and labelled the demand as "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
"Shock" sales last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Canberra's Costco also limited the allowed quantity to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles booked larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of delivery, Woolworths booked additional stock, while ALDI made stock for the special Wednesday plan available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said that retailers were trying to increase their stock but local council restrictions on truck-delivery time made it difficult.
He expects product costs to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand, and a little bit of special.

News.com.au reports Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist from Queensland University of Technology, said the store is stocking up every night.
told us that the toilet paper was a huge commodity, leading to low quantities on the stock, and, when sold out, leaving vast shelf space empty, further reinforcing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the view that if there's a variety of items on the shelf, if products like toiletries and tanning materials can be [purchased] and have quantity, you'll probably reduce panic, says Russell Zimmerman on ABC News.
The toilet paper manufacturer recycled Who Gives a Crap last Wednesday and they're out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes Kleenex Toilet Tissues, and Solaris Paper who makes Sorbent, insist that they are working 24/7 to maintain supplies, according to a report by New.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some real estate sellers offered free toiletries to the first bidder at an auction session in Melbourne, when few auctions were held due to buyers facing a holiday during the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a daily print in Darwin, included eight additional pages intended to be cut and used as toiletries.
The stores were originally reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on 3 March which saw them saying they had no plans to introduce limits on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products are also in high demand, including masks, detergents, dry foods, hand washing and flooring.

The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.

We are very concerned about both the alarming levels of transmission and severity and the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic "has never been seen before".
He said in a quote published by CNN in February, "apart from influenza, no other respiratory virus has been detected from the emergence to ongoing worldwide transmission".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying"we have never before seen a pandemic triggered by a coronavirus".
" And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time".
The new status as a pandemic follows the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak as an international public health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the pandemic, "In short, it's going to get worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, causing over 4,600 deaths.
20 is the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a Public Health Emergency at the International Level on 30 January 2020, and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, causing approximately 97,000 deaths.
364,000 people have been cured.
The case fatality rate has been estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually around five days, but may be between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.Suggested preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth during coughing, maintaining distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for those who suspect themselves infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard control and facility closures.
The pandemic has caused global socioeconomic disruption, postponements or cancellations of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread supply shortages driven by panic buying.
Schools and universities have been closed either nationwide or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.

As a result of travel cuts and the closure of heavy industry, there has been a reduction in air pollution as well as carbon releases.

Most of the cases are related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and cause the virus to be suspected to be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the bat coronavirus, the crow coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The earliest known person to develop the symptoms was later found to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and the person had no apparent connection to the subsequent wet market cluster.
For the initial cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.

There may be a corresponding number of unreported cases, particularly among those with milder symptoms.

Case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and who have tested positive according to official protocol.

A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had gone undetected, and that these unrecorded infections were the source for 79% of recorded cases.

The initial estimate of the R0 for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the number might be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not, the time from onset to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include those who die without being tested - e.g. at home, in care centres, etc.


The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside of mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country have been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of 13 March, over forty countries and territories have reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
The death-to-case ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.

In China, estimates for the ratio of deaths to cases decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms beginning 110 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms beginning after 1 February 2020). Other measures include case mortality rate (CFR), which describes the percentage of those diagnosed who die from the disease, and infection mortality rate (IFR), which describes the percentage of those infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution.
Academics have tried to calculate this number for a specific population.
Oxford University's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection mortality rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The top estimates for this range are consistent with the results of the first randomized trial for COVID-19 in Germany, and statistical studies that analyze the effects of the test on the CFR estimate.
WHO has insisted that the pandemic is manageable.
The peak and peak periods of the outbreak are uncertain and can vary by location.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University commented, "Leave unchecked, infectious epidemics are usually flat and then begin to decline when the disease runs out of available homes.
"eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

On 17 March, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly for a year or two".
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical training and other measures would be needed "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner, Vanderbilt University, said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, because it's so infectious, will disappear completely" and it "may be a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The severity of the recurrence will depend upon herd immunity and mutation level.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively nonspecific and an infected person may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms were fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists symptoms of an emergency as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and blue eyes or lips; immediate medical attention is sought if these symptoms are present. The further progression of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results confirming infection, so researchers have issued advice that those in close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and screened for infection.
China estimates asymptomatic rates from slight to 44%.
The typical inhibition period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; the most common is five days. As an example of uncertainty, estimates of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell initially range from 30% and then decreased to 15%.

The disease is believed to be spread primarily during close contact and through tiny droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking; with close contact being at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that unprotected coughing will cause the ai droplets to move up to 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some people have suggested that the virus may also be transmitted via small droplets that remain for longer periods in the air, which may be generated during speaking. Breathing droplets may also be produced during exhalation, including during speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
The droplets can land in the mouth or nose of a nearby person or they can be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions to become blocked and thus result in airborne diffusion.
The virus can also be spread when a person touches contaminated surfaces, including skin, and then they touch their eyes, nose or mouth.

The Chinese government denies the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most easily transmitted during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however infection may occur before symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease.

Only a few lab-confirmed asymptomatic case reports exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by several countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not so clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others. The virus remains for hours to days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for up to a day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on copper.

There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but British authorities advise washing hands after touching animals, such as after touching other surfaces that may have been touched by those infected.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the acute respiratory disease case cluster in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 novel viruses occur in association with coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soaps, which destroy its protective shields. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (descent B) along with two strains derived from bats.
The virus is 96% similar at full genome level to another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in a particular part of the genome sequence between the virus from the tick and the virus from humans.
The genome-wide variation so far has found as much as 92% of the genetic material shared between the tenggeril coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove tenggeril as an intermediate host.
Infection by the virus can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, although eventual confirmation is via reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) transcription of infected secretions or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, albeit less specific, with most of its imaging features overlapping with the processes of pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-1, with the first one being released on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) transcription.
This test can be performed on a respiratory or blood sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
The test is usually performed with a nasopharyngeal swab but a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these tests have been proven accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the US the serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic imaging features on X-rays and computed tomography (CT) for symptomatic angina include asymmetrical partial vitreous expansion and absent pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an online database to search for imaging for confirmed cases.

One large study in China compared the results of chest CT with PCR and showed that although imaging is less specific to infection, the method is faster and more sensitive, suggesting consideration of the method as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
An artificial intelligence-based circular neural network has been developed to detect viral imaging with both X-rays and CTs.

Those who may have been infected have been advised to wear surgical masks in public.

The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and over 100 other organisations issuing statements calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.

Users then receive messages if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misfeedback is circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and rinsing with a mouthwash is ineffective.
No COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop a vaccine.

CDC recommends that the public wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands look dirty; before eating; and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
e outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which destroys its protective bubbles.
CDC further recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not available for use.
WHO advises the public to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
71% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidon-iodin.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and crohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a facility such as an office or day care center, all areas such as offices, restrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATM machines used by sick people, should be decontaminated.
WHO recommends that people cover their mouths and noses with bent arms or tissue when coughing or sneezing, and dispose of any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing masks can limit the amount and distance of exhalation droplets that are spread during talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene". Masks have also been recommended for use by those caring for someone who may be infected.
WHO has recommended mask wearing by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those caring for people with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by members of the community.
In the US, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of fabric. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or being in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibit going out in public without wearing a mask or covering one's nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear face masks when going out in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has mandated that everyone entering the grocery store must wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks daily since mid-March, has asked passengers of intercity trains and buses to wear face masks on 1 April.
Panama has mandated the wearing of face masks when going out, while also recommending the manufacture of face masks at home for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.

Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is accompanied by infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shopping malls.
Individuals can implement social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact salons, and isolating themselves physically from others.
Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in the provinces affected by the pandemic.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known COVID-19 transmission in the region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings by more than two people. Older adults and those with hidden health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems face an increased risk for serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas with community outbreaks. In late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began replacing the use of the term "social incarceration" with "physical incarceration", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social contact, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social incarceration" has led to the implication that people should undergo complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to interact with others through alternative means. Some parties have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those who are tested positive for COVID-19 and those who are suspected to have been infected.
Agencies have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in the high-risk groups.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have previously travelled to countries or territories with widespread transmission have been advised to undergo self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
The strategy in controlling epidemics is containment or suppression, and mitigation.

When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the reduction stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the health care system and society.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
This reduces the risk of health services becoming overburdened and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage transmission include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community-targeted measures of physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gatherings; community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning. More drastic measures targeted to contain transmission have been taken in China after the severity of the epidemic became apparent, for example by quarantining entire cities and enforcing travel bans.
Other countries have also taken various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced massive screening and local quarantines, as well as issuing warnings about the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provides financial support to those infected who self-quarantine and imposes high fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and fined for boosting medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing down but not stopping the spread of epidemics) and suppression (stopping epidemic growth) have major challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies might reduce peak health care demands to 2/3 and deaths by half, but still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and the health system becomes overburdened.
Treatment can be optional but should be maintained as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that comes first), as the spread will soon bounce back when prevention measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to curb the pandemic have resulted in social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drug has been approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop it, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter flu medication, drinking water and resting will help to alleviate the symptoms.
depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid and respiratory support may be required.
Steroid use may worsen the effects.

WHO also states that some "traditional and home treatments" may provide relief for symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.

ECDC and WHO's European regional office have issued guidelines for hospitals and key healthcare services to mobilize resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, canceling elective procedures when necessary, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, as well as enhancing intensive care capacity by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are various theories about where the first case (called the null number patient) originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus can be traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.

In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, aided by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan becoming a transportation hub as well as a major railway interchange.
On January 20, China reported almost 140 new cases in a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.

About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and implemented border controls.

The Chinese New Year celebration (January 25) was cancelled in many places.

Another hospital was built afterwards, the Leishenshan Hospital, to handle additional patients.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Universities and schools across the country are also closed.
Hong Kong and Macau regions are initiating a number of measures, particularly in relation to schools and universities.

travel restrictions are in place in and out of Hubei.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On 23 March, Mainland China had only one case of domestic transmission in 5 days, in this case the traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Those wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and provided a financial stimulus package to firms. The State Council declared a day of mourning beginning with a three-minute moment of silence at 10:00 am on April 4, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the federal government asked families to show respect online as they complied with physical distancing to avoid a repeat COVID-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
The national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to the gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Jesus Church.
Shincheonji who visited Daegu from Wuhan is suspected to be the source of the infection.

South Korea introduced what is considered to be the most widespread and systematic program in the world to screen the population for the virus, and isolate any infected individuals and track and quarantine those who came into contact with them.

South Korea's program is considered successful in controlling the epidemic despite not quarantining the entire city. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Most Koreans signed the petition either demanding Moon's dismissal over what they claimed was government mismanagement of the pandemic, or praising his response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest daily number of cases in four weeks.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
As reported by media on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.
Iran reported its first confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection on 19 February in Qom, which saw, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two deaths later that day.
The government announced early precautions including cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports events, and Friday prayers, and closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has allocated 5 trillion rials to fight the virus.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Shiite dining in Qom remains open to visitors until 16 March 2020. Iran became the centre of the spread of the virus after China in February.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

It states that there is a greater risk for the virus to spread in closed institutions such as detention centres, which also lack adequate health care.


As of 23 March, Iran has recorded 50 new cases every hour and one new death every 10 minutes due to coronavirus.
According to WHO officials, there may be five times more cases in Iran than reported.
It also suggests that US sanctions on Iran may affect the country's financial ability to respond to the virus outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the economic sanctions to be eased for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.


Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus as well as methods that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample was confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
The test is specifically designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA only.
The test is used to confirm a very new or active infection.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The exact mortality rate and the level of cluster immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.

As of 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of their population, and there is considerable variation in the number of tests that have been performed across countries.
This diversity is also likely to affect the significantly reported case mortality rate, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) real-time testing can be performed on respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples.
The decision is usually available within hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests performed with throat swabs are reliable only in the first week of illness.
Then the virus can disappear in the throatwhile continuing to multiply in the lungs.
For those infected tested in the second test, alternatively, sample material can then be taken from the in-airway or in-air using inhalation catheters or cough-causing material (sputum) can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse polymerase reaction transcription (rRT-PCR), and became the basis for 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom has also developed a test by 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based, clinical grade (PowerChek Coronavirus) SARS-CoV-2 detection kit on 28 January 2020.
It searches for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the China National Medicines Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RT-PCR Real-Time Diagnostic Panel to public health laboratories via the International Reagent Resource.
one of the three genetic tests in the old version of the test kit caused uncertain results due to defective reagents, and the bottle neck test at the CDC in Atlanta; this yielded on average less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020;

The test has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 testing available nationwide from 9 March 2020.
No quantity limit has been announced; collection of specimens and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test has been developed and produced by the VECTOR State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology.
On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be performed in 3.5 hours in high numbers, while allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for a test that took approximately 45 minutes.
FDA approved trials using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
nce this test does not require a series of varying temperature cycles this method can give a positive result in as fast as five minutes and a negative result in as little as 13 minutes.

In March 2020 a review of the paper concluded that "chest radiographs have little diagnostic value at an early stage, whereas CT [computed tomography] findings may have been present even before symptoms began".
Typical features of CT include a multilobal dwisis ground glass blackout with partial, asymmetrical and posterior dispersions.
Subpleural dominance, opening of the spine and fusion form as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, albeit less specific, with many of its imaging features interacting with the processes of pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".[] As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for early screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.

The high-throughput automated system in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this assessment but its availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
For CLT a single specimen of peripheral blood is usually used, although serial specimens can be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT a single sample of blood is usually obtained by injection into the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, screening measures are not required prior to evaluation.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization.
The test capacity is a few hundred samples in a few hours and is therefore much faster than conventional PCR assessment for viral RNA.
In early April, the UK found no antibody test kits purchased good enough to use.
Hong Kong has set up a scheme whereby suspected patients can stay at home, "emergency departments will give the patient a specimen tube", they spit into the tube, send it back and get test results soon after. NHS British has announced that it is pioneering a scheme to test suspected cases at home, which removes the risk of patients infecting others if they go to hospital or have to disconnect an ambulance if used. In a previous pilot test for COVID-19 for suspected cases, a healthcare worker took samples using appropriate precautions.
The pilot centre has helped South Korea conduct some of the fastest, most comprehensive testing of any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Medical Experts said on 2 March, that they had a capacity of 12,000 tests per day in an outpatient setting and 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are covered by the health insurance when the test is requested by a medical professional.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Jerrman has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, test drives have been offered in several major cities.

The World Health Organization adopts the German method for kit production which is sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop kits themselves.
The German method was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centres for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying existing tests in the US. China and the US had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of their development, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply sufficient kits to meet demand and recommendations for testing by health experts.

testing capacity, much of it is in private sector labs, built in a few years by the south korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for an increase in the testing program as the best way to slow the COVID-19 pandemic.
In March 2020 China reported problems with the accuracy of their test kits.
In the United States, the test kit developed by the CDC had "a drawback"; the government later issued a bureaucratic restriction that had prevented private testing. The Spanish state bought the test kit from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Biotechnology Co ltd, but found its decision to be inaccurate.
The firm explained that the incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or use the kit correctly.

Prime Minister Matovic suggested that the kits be dumped in the Danube.Ates Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health told the test kits Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "use them".The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced these test kits could not be used.
The test, followed by quarantining those who tested positive and tracing those who came into contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, site of Italy's first COVID-19 death, conducted two rounds of testing across a population of nearly 3,400 people, approximately ten days apart.
Almost half of the individuals who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases found were quarantined.

Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has begun advising its citizens to stay home on 28 March, but schools will reopen in time after the holiday on 23 March.

One statistical study found that countries that did more testing, relative to the number of deaths, had lower mortality rates, possibly because these countries were better able to detect those with only mild or no immediate symptoms.
WHO recommended that countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience of COVID-19 send the first five positive samples and ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "Positive as % of test" column is influenced by the national testing policy.
The countries that only tested hospitalized individuals would get a higher positive score as a % of test than countries that tested all the people, whether they showed symptoms or not, the rest is the same.

Individuals can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (e.g., mucous membranes).
The five critical times of day that witness handwashing with soap are important include: before and after flushing, after cleaning a child's back or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.

Before, during, and after preparing the meal.
Before and after handling patients.
After changing diapers or cleaning the kids who've been using the toilet.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal feces.

Washing hands before handling medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the transmission of disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but is also an important practice for the general public.

and lower infant mortality at home.

In developing countries, the rate of childhood deaths associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, for example washing hands with soap.
This simple step could reduce the mortality rate from this disease by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about one third, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in diarrhea episodes can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as an automatic behavior is done in homes, schools and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, the leading ARI, is the number one cause of death in children under five years of age, claiming the lives of about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together cause nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, making it a habit to wash your hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or combination of medicines, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by almost a quarter.
Washing hands is usually combined with other sanitation interventions as part of the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programme.

The small downside of washing hands too often is that washing hands too hard can lead to skin damage due to dryness on the skin.
A study from Denmark in 2012 found that excessive hand washing can lead to itching, a scaly skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common among healthcare workers.
Too much hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission of fecal plague to the mouth: after using the toilet (toilet, faucet), after cleaning a child's back (changing diapers), before bribing a child, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.


In 2015, a handwashing study in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households had handwashing practices with soap. In 2014, a study showed Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States was near the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate of 23 percent. Several behavioral change methodologies now exist to improve handwashing with soap at critical times. Schoolchildren washing their hands in groups at set times is one of the options in developing countries to implement handwashing behaviors in children.
The Essential Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
Urinating twice a year, plus washing hands daily with soap, and brushing teeth daily with florida. is the core of this national program.
It's been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin can be improved by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce the blockage on the solution, and increase solubility.

Because of its recyclable nature, soap may retain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies on bacterial transfer from contaminated soap bubbles have found that transfer is unlikely to occur because bacteria are eliminated when washed with foam.
CDC website still states "liquid soap that is removed without using hands is better".
Antibacterial soap is highly promoted in the health conscious public.
There is no evidence to date that using antiseptics or disinfectants is recommended to select for antibiotic resistant organisms.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies show that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial content of hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, alcohol-based non-water-based hand sanitizer rubs (also known as alcohol-based rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizer) began to become popular.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a thickening agent such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into a gel, or a humicant such as glycerin into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to reduce the effects of alcohol drying.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizer containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol is an efficient debugger.
Rubbing alcohol kills bacteria, drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and several viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
70% alcohol-containing rubber hand sanitizer kills 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logs, equivalent to reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% (reduction of 4 to 5 logs) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after use. Hand sanitizer is most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type virus, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.Antifungal hand or adequate alcohol rubbing must be used to properly moisten or protect both hands.
Rub the front and back of both hands and between the tips of all fingers for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than rubbing them with hand sanitizer, especially when hands look dirty.
The increased use of this agent is due to its ease of use and rapid killing activity of microorganisms. However, it cannot replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emolines to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing emollients caused a significant reduction in skin irritation and dryness compared to soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to alcohol-containing rubbing additives are rare.
Tendencies to reduce irritating contact dermatitis to attractive than using soap and water to wash hands.
non-water, although effective, does not clean hands of organic matter.
This is why hand sanitizer is less effective than soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, because pathogens are still on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends heavily on its ingredients and formulation, and has historically been less successful than alcohol and alcohol rubbing.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol which has been shown to decrease its effectiveness after multiple uses, possibly due to inappropriate reactions on the skin progressively.
Most low-income people can't afford soap, instead they use ash or soil.
Ash or soil might be more effective than using water alone but might be less effective than using soap.
The concern is that soil or ash may be contaminated with microorganisms that may increase rather than reduce the transmission of disease.
Ashes are also a disinfectant agent like soap because they form an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap if soap is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends proper handwashing techniques to prevent the transmission of disease, including the following:
Wet hands with running water, either warm or cold.

Wash your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly with soap than with just water.
Sit for at least 20 seconds.
Crimping creates a shift, which helps remove germs from the skin, and longer-term crimping removes more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Rinsing in a sink can get your hands dirty again.
Dry with a clean towel or let it air dry.
Wet hands are more likely to get dirty again. The thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers and under the fingernails are the areas that are often overlooked.
The microorganisms may be stored in the fake nails and the peeled nail polish.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to prevent hands from becoming dry; dry skin can cause skin damage which can increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are various inexpensive options to facilitate hand washing if there is no tap water and/or soap, e.g. pouring water from a hanging or pumpkin tin with a suitable hole and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. If water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as "pipe tippi" and other inexpensive options.

In 2008, a study was done by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry, the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of hygiene when using paper towels, hot air hand dryers and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the number of bacteria found on the bottom of the fingertips increased by an average of 194% and on the palm by 254%.
Aerodryer drying causes an increase in the number of bacteria on the underside of the fingertips by an average of 42% and on the palm by 15%.

The jet air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 bps), is capable of blowing out microorganisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment by up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different hand drying methods.
The following changes were observed in the bacterial count after hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towels for drying.

As germs can stay in the water on your hands, you should wash them thoroughly and apply them to dry with a clean towel.
After drying the hands, the paper towel should be used to cover the water (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting dirty again when they touch the surface.
Lavar las manos en un entorno de salud se propone eliminar los microorganismos patógenos ("pozo") y evitar su propagación.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that persistent handwashing is at an unacceptable level in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thereby spreading microorganisms.
One study showed that washing hands properly and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%. The World Health Organization published a document setting out standards for hand washing and hand rubbing in the healthcare sector.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines by the organization are also available on its website for public comment.
The relevant review was done by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has a "Five Moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood/body fluid
before aseptic duty, and
adding antiseptic chemicals to soap (soap "medicated" or "antimicrobial") gives the hand washing agent a killing effect.
To 'wash' one's hands for surgery, there should be a pipe that can be turned on and off without touching with hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, and sterile brushes for rubbing and other sterile tools to clean under the fingernails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
Long rubbing time (10 minutes) is not required.
When rinsing, water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back to the hand.
After washing, hands are dried with a sterile cloth and surgical vest is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use antiseptics before and after treating a sick person.

There is a need for more research on which interventions are most effective in different health settings.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a cost-effective tool and essential to achieve good health, even good nutrition.

For example, in most rural areas in Africa, hand washing pipes near every private and public toilet are very rare, although there are cheap options available for building hand washing stations.

Promotion and advocacy for hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavioural changes in the population.
To make this thing work, we need monitoring and evaluation.
A systematic review of 70 studies found community-based approaches effective in improving handwashing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of handwashing promotion in schools was the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEP which encouraged schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.

one survey showed that promoting hand washing with soap was much more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Forence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At the time most people still believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called miasmas.
In the 1980s, the epidemic of foodborne and healthcare-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "proper hand washing techniques" are hung next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "wash one's hands of" something, means to declare one's refusal to take responsibility for the thing or share involvement in it.
It comes from the Bible verse in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase with wider use in some English communities.

It was found that people, after remembering or reflecting on unethical acts, tended to wash their hands more often than others and appreciated hand washing devices more.

Tibla
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam also mandate washing hands before and after eating.

Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is an application of the occupational health and safety methodology for hazard control to the prevention of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal workplace contact with the public and other coworkers, where basic infection prevention measures are recommended including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay in the hospital if they are hospitalized, respiratory ethics, and maintaining routine hygiene and disinfection in the workplace.

This includes employees who have contact with the public such as in schools, work environments with high population density, and some retail environments with high volume.

OSHA considers health care and morgue workers exposed to people known or suspected to have COVID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if the worker performs aerosol production procedures on, or collects or handles specimens from people known or suspected to have COVID-19.

COVID-19 may have some effects in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work because they are sick, need to care for others or fear exposure.

Lastly, the delivery of goods from geographical areas directly affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted. Preparedness and response plan for infectious diseases can be used as a guide to protective action.
Plan addresses the level of risk associated with various work sites and employment tasks including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community environment, and individual worker risk factors such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the controls necessary to manage such risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or subnational plan recommendations.

The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the response taken.

Engineering control involves isolating workers from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in work policy or procedure that requires action by the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected based on hazards to workers, properly installed according to suitability (cth respirator), worn correctly on a consistent basis, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced, if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower-risk exposure jobs have minimal work-related contact with the public and other coworkers.

Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a critical step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have acute respiratory symptoms stay home until they are free from fever, signs of fever or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medications, and a flexible sick leave policy, allowing employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees know about this policy.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure risk jobs include jobs that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of a person who is unknown or suspected to have COVID-19 patients, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the business location, or because the individual recently traveled internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This includes workers who have contact with the public such as in schools, high-density work environments and some high-volume retail environments. Engineering controls for these and higher-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as plastic sneeze shields and installing pass-through windows for customer service. Administrative controls for these and higher-risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with frequent communication, virtually creating tiered rotations, stopping non-essential travel to locations with an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, developing emergency communication plans including forums to respond to worker concerns, providing employees with up-to-date education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviour, training workers to wear protective clothing and gear, providing consumers with safe and supportive environments, promoting access to safe and sanitary facilities, and putting at least some of the necessary protective gear, face masks and other protective gear on the job, and providing guidance on how to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID-19 to the public.
Workers in this risk group rarely require the use of respirators.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when treating sick travelers or when touching bodily fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick traveler develops a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Preferably, medical follow-up should be done inside the quarantined person's cabin. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if the infected person has been inside the school building regardless of community spread.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
When there is a high level of transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school closures may be considered. CDC considers the risk to the health of law enforcement personnel who engage in routine activities to be low.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
OSHA considers health care workers and morgue workers to be in the high or very high risk category for exposure.

It becomes a very high risk of exposure if the worker performs aerosol production procedures on, or collects or handles specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
The procedures for producing aerosols include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, several dental procedures and examinations, or invasive specimen collection.

A ventilation with a specific negative pressure may be appropriate in some health care facilities and morgues.
The specimen must be handled with Biosafety Level 3 caution.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients be placed in different quarantine waiting rooms depending on whether they are suspected cases of COVID-19. In addition to PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of patients known, or suspected, to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who are performing aerosol production procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filter facial respirators or better must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including fit testing, training and medical examinations.
WHO does not recommend wearing masks as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is not spread through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends only surgical masks for entry checkpoint staff.
For those collecting respiratory specimens from, treating, or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol manufacturing procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, eye protection, or face protectors, protective vests and gloves.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
As the global supply of PPE is inadequate, WHO recommends to minimize the need for PPE through telehealth, physical barriers such as clear windows, by allowing only those involved in direct care to enter the COVID-19 patient room, using only the PPE needed for specific tasks, continuing the use of the same respirator without removing it when caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

[COVID-19]Summing up and preparing for the future
DAT/MOMENT: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC

We find ourselves in a very unusual situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is something that has made our connectivity in the world and our responsibilities to each other clear.
We haven't had this challenge before, but we know that our best response depends on the kind of empathy, cooperation and community building that's at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we've seen among all our colleagues through e-mail, phone and chat are an incredible confirmation of the extraordinary human beings we're fortunate enough to work with.
I'm so grateful and proud to be your colleague.
Last week, some people shared with me their appreciation for our work.
It reminds me of how much the world means now to be able to refer to Wikipedia, and how it's become a symbol of power because this critical resource remains online and available to everyone.
your job makes all this possible, whether you keep the site up or your co-workers get paid or our community is safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
t is a moment where not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.

As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that discussion, we considered what we thought would be the appropriate response to what we were facing and the best way to ensure that this organization could survive at this time.
Together, we want to reduce stress and support our mission for the long term.

To all staff, contractors and contractors:
Our daily work schedule will be approximately 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We're not announcing a leave of absence - if you can work on your regular hours, the mission can use you.

This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
if you want to work, we support you.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Again, this is about taking care of yourself.
solo pedimos que comuniques con tu manager para que sepamos qué esperar y que podamos ajustar conforme
Some jobs are considered essential.
There are certain things we must keep moving.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Security, and Fundraising teams (among others) perform critical work that may require additional assistance.
We'll begin a process with all departments to evaluate current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what's important to our mission.

Today's delay won't hurt later.
We don't plan to move "double-up to catch up" once this pandemic is over.
You're not expected to work overtime to meet a deadline that's now unrealistic.
We recognize that the situation has changed, and we will endeavor to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What happened to the APP?
To adapt to the reality and expectations of our daily working hours, we would like to adjust the timeline for the submission of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our desire is to recommend an extension of the 2019-2020 plan which allows more time for budgets to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and care for their loved ones while assisting those who need or want to work with reduced hours for the next few weeks.
extending the timeline greatly reduces the workload and the stress of current planning throughout the organization.
We'll be presenting our proposal to the Board next week and will inform the delegates and teams of the next steps once we get confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.

Last week, we were informed that one of our SF colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.

Use hospital-grade antivirus to disinfect every surface and lobby and elevator system that reaches our floor.
The building adopts its own duty of care protocol in using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We felt comfortable that the office would be well available when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located on WeWork, who shares COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC-based staff.
As of last week, our DC offices have switched to remote setup
As some of my NYC-based colleagues know, we've also been discussing the possibility of a location in Brooklyn.
The discussion is ongoing but may be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
longtime colleague we knew that it might be a fit and wanted to give you some advice:
Limite the duration of the meeting to an extra hour or two.
If longer sessions are needed, consider splitting them up into several days.
Set a clear meeting schedule, schedule, and send out the reading material ahead of time.
Create default video, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom for easier collaboration and live connections.
Have a leader to handle each meeting, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and track the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or do collaborative note-taking).
Email tech support if you need a comfortable headset.

We told them that we understood our request for cancellations and other restrictions might be something impossible in completing their agreed grant activities and no one would be held accountable for delay or modification of those goals.
next week we'll follow up with additional guides about Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general feeling from the entire global community seems to be sadness at the disruption but relief at the clarity and ability to focus on their own community, Wikimedia and vice versa.
Going forward, CRT is working to develop a page about Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay in touch for COVID-19 related issues
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.

nobodyofthesechangesshouldbe viewed as neglecting our job and responsibilities.
eit'sallto acknowledge thatat this point,our jobs and responsibilities are likely to need to be adjusted in a way that hasn't been in the past.
These are steps we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can keep working, provide our movement with the support they need, and the world service they can expect.
Our planned mission will be there to wait for us when the time comes.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 opposes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity associated with reducing angiotensin-II levels and increasing Ang ((1-7) making it a hopefully targeted drug for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry center for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of the endothelium and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal M2 peptidase domain and a C-terminal renal amino acid transporter domain of colectin.
ACE2 is a single-pass type 1 membrane protein, with its active enzyme domain exposed on the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
ACE2 extracellular domains are attached to transmembrane domains by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting dissolved proteins are released into the bloodstream and eventually digested into urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 twins on the cell membranes of most alveolar type II cells of the lungs, entrosites of the small intestine, arteries and endothelium cells of the veins and arterial soft muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem.
ACE2's primary function is to act as a counterbalance to ACE.
ACE binds the hormone angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
ACE2 instead binds to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also bind to a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane distribution of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is shown in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as a major entry point into cells for some coronaviruses including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19).
In particular, binding to the S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 on the enzyme domain ACE2 on the surface of the cell results in endosytosis and translocation of the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes located between the cells.
The entry process also requires the screening of the S protein by the TMPRSS2 host serine prosthesis, a inhibitor under current study as a potential therapeutic. This has led some to hypothesize that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help in fighting infection.
However, various professional associations and regulatory bodies recommend continuing with standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Additionally, "the risk of pneumonia is also reduced for patients treated with ACE inhibitors who are at higher risk for pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the conclusions are less consistent with the overall risk of pneumonia".
Refusion of human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen depletion in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour impact action (time).
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to the classical renin angiotensin system inhibitor (RAS inhibitor) or in diseases surrounding enhanced angiotensin II.  rhACE2 infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
b'COVID-19 app is a mobile software application designed to help contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") of those who may have come into contact with an infected individual.

some framework for building a contact tracking app has been developed.
Privacy concerns were raised, particularly about systems based on tracking the geographic location of user applications.



It's used in over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.

Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed their concerns about the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, in particular about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be stopped once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organisations issued a statement calling for a limit on this kind of surveillance.
The organization declares eight conditions for government projects:
the supervision should be 'legitimate, where necessary and proportionate';
follow-up monitoring and supervision shall have a sixth clause;
use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
the security of data and the identity shall be protected and shown to be protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid further exacerbating discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties shall be defined in law;
should be protected from abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;

The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the ongoing surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking rather than apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
Israel has approved network-based tracking.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have huge potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with centralized servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy preservation systems have been created that use centralized servers only for communication with each other (see section below).
In South Korea, an app-based system is used to track contacts.
Rather than using dedicated apps, the system collects tracking information from various sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and the combination of all these generates text message notifications to potentially infected individuals.

Following the link with maintaining privacy is a concept that is organized with important body study literature starting since 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working for privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log the proximity of users on other mobile phones.
PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains a centralized and decentralized approach, rather than a single protocol. decentralized protocols include the Decentralized Privacy Preservation Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Identification Number (TCN, FKA Identification Event Number, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocol and Mechanism for Tracking Mobile Connections (PACT) and others.
In this protocol, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all inhibition happens on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group is developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy preservation techniques when collecting and using location or cross-sectional data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technology that was also originally based at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising data privacy.

On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used by official government applications open source.

They also publish the specifications of the core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system intends to be launched in three stages:

The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many trials in progress to develop such a vaccine.

5 candidate vaccines are in Phase 1 safety trials in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The global spread of a major pandemic in 2020, provided for intensive investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organisations are using the published genome to develop a possible vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
Declared in April, the imperative of the CEPI initiative for accelerated vaccine development, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms are under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platforms targeted for advancement into the Phase I safety study include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase 1 developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 more announced, but with little public information available (considered to be in planning or being designed).
Phase I-II trials perform preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, typically randomized, placebo-controlled and multi-site, while determining the effective dose more accurately.
Phase III trials typically involve more participation including control groups and efficacy trials on vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring for adverse effects at optimal doses.
Of 79 vaccine candidates in active development (stated as of early April 2020), 74 are still in human evaluation) still in "preclinical" research.

At the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million dedicated to developing a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurred.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the testing of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA administered the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine which elicited a strong antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] that was demonstrated to have begun 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced a design for a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a possible nasal spray.

In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities pooled resources for supercomputer access from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have a heterologous effect, also called a nonspecific effect.
i.e. they may have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Australia has randomized trials aimed at enrolling 4,170 health care workers.
There is a possibility that a vaccine in development is not safe or effective.

Vaccines for SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, no vaccine for SARS has been proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide. Furthermore, no vaccine has been proven against MERS.

As of March 2020, there is one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that has completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are underway, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).

The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequencing and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually five days but may range from two to fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.

568,000 have recovered. The virus is particularly spread between humans through close contact, often through tiny droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets are produced during inhalation, they usually fall to the ground or above the surface rather than becoming infectious for long distances.

Virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
Most infectious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread may occur before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect themselves of carrying the virus and their caregivers.

currently, there is no specific vaccine or viral treatment for COVID-19.
local transmission of disease has been recorded in most countries throughout all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or show flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Symptoms of emergency include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and facial or lip bluishness; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear.
Rarely, upper respiratory complaints such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
gastro-specific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are observed in multiple percentages.
some cases in china initially only showed data jamming and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
It's called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days but may be between two and 14 days.
97.5% of patients who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected people show symptoms.
The role of this asymptomatic carrier in transmission is still not fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that it may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of those infected who show no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KDCC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in their daily case count on 1 April; of 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
and saliva can carry a high viral load.
Talk loudly releases more droplets than normal talk.
A study in Singapore found that unclogged coughs can cause droplets to move up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not innate, the National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transfer is possible and that air collectors at indoor aisle locations outside public rooms show positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to aerosol and subsequently cause endogenous spread.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person infects two to three people generally. The virus survives for several hours to several days on the surface.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable for up to a day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used correctly; soap products weaken the virus's fat-protective coating, deactivating it and freeing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical anti-infectious agent) are less effective. In one Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken for a median of two days after the start of hospital admission.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All novel SARS-CoV-2 virus features occur in naturally related coronaviruses.

The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 as the virus accesses host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface of glycoprotein called a "pepcollum" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury is found in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China and is more common in severe illness.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disease during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
The high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be related to poor prognosis. Autopsies of those who died from COVID-19 have found damage to the diffuse alveolus (DAD), and lymphocyte invasion containing inflammation within the lungs.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF secreting T cells have been shown to correlate with inflammatory IL-6 secreting monocyte uptake and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic invasion was also reported during autopsy.
WHO publishes several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rPT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on a breath sample obtained with a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or a stool sample may also be used.
The decision is generally available within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the coronavirus strain and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody testing (possibly detecting active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) is in development but not widely used.
China's experience with testing has shown accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
FDA in the United States approved the first initial care test on 21 March 2020 for use by the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
The opacity of the shattered glass is bilateral with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distributions is common during early infection.
Subpleural dominance, multiple bulges (thickening of the lobular septum with multiple alveolus fillings) and unification may occur as the disease progresses.
Some data are available on the monoscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The major pathological findings during autopsy were:
Makroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary unification and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity for viral pneumonia can be observed:
: pneumonia leve: edema pulmonare, pneumocytes, hiperplasia, pneumocytes atypical grande, inflammation of spaces with lymphocytic invasion and formation of giant multinucleate cells
severe pneumonia: damage to the diffuse alveolus (DAD) with exudate of the diffuse alveolus.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
recovering pneumonia: exudate buildup in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary spacial fibrosis
Blood: distributed intravascular coagulation (DIC), leukoerythroblast complex

CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the shoulder area if tissue is missing.
Proper hand washing after any coughing or sneezing is recommended.
CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public places, in part to limit displacement by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with large groups through closures of schools and workplaces, limiting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
The guidelines also include for the public to be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands look dirty, before eating or after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It is recommended to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol but only when soap and water are not available. For areas that do not have commercial hand sanitizer, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity appears from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not the active ingredient for hand antisepsis".
Added glycerol as a moisturizer.
The public is treated with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other important affected organs.
CDC recommends that anyone who suspects they have the virus to wear a simple face mask.
Extrakorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used to address respiratory failure issues, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to boost immunity.

Critical care and pulmonology professionals in the U.S. collect treatment insurance from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for first line use.
The virus is transmitted by the body through the bloodstream.
For healthcare professionals caring for those infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in an Infection-Intensive Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautionary measures, contact and in-contact precautionary measures. The CDC provides guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.

Most COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some percent do.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 associated with respiratory failure is being actively studied for patients in hospitals with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with high-rotation nasal cannula or two-level positive airway pressure.

Some doctors choose to stick with invasive mechanical ventilation if available as this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are usually frequent among older adults (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of the health system to handle the sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 cases that are sufficiently severe to require hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilator support and 1.4% died.
In China, at least 30% of patients in hospital with COVID-19 will eventually be admitted to the ICU.
Ventilation
Ventilators are able to regulate pressure and high PEEP is required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of ventilator-related lung injury and pneumothorax.
PEEPs may not be available on ventilators any longer.
Research for potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir appears to be the most likely.

Antiviral drugs may be tested in people who have severe illnesses.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in trials for the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. FDA gives provisional approval for plasma restoration as an experimental treatment in cases for which their lives are seriously or readily threatened.
It has not yet gone through the clinical trials needed to show it is safe and effective for disease.

Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia is implementing facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Giulio Gallera, Italy's regional health commissioner, said he was informed by a mobile phone operator that "40% of the population continues to move around".
The German government is running a 48-hour hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
Also the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid called for a global for creative solutions to the coronavirus transmission.
Individual may experience stress from quarantine, travel restrictions, effects from treatment or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: "

In most severely affected individuals, COVID-19 can rapidly degenerate into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure.
COVID-19 related complications include sepsis, abnormal clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Cramps, particularly increases in prothrombin time, were apparent in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function was observed in 4% of this group.
At least 20-30% of people who are infected with COVID-19 show elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between onset of symptoms and death is 10 days, with five days left for hospitalization.
,,,...............
In the initial case study, the median time from the initial symptom designation to death was 14 days, with full coverage of six to 41 days.

Histopatological examination of post-mortem lung samples showed damage to the diffuse alveolus with exudate cellular fibromisoid in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes are observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung scan showed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was observed with increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalized with pre-existing health conditions, the availability of medical resources and socioeconomic regions may also have an impact on the mortality rate.
Estimates of death rates from the states vary due to differences in their regions, but also due to the difficulty of methodology.
underestimated the mortality rate.

Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have at least 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than nonsmokers. Concerns have been voiced about the long-term consequences of the disease.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some patients who recovered from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.
It may also lead to post-concussion syndrome.
As of March 2020, it is unknown whether previous infections provide effective and long-term immunity in those who recover from the disease.
Immunity is seen as possible, based on the behaviour of other coronavirus, but in cases with recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by a positive test for the coronavirus on a date that has been reported.
All these cases are believed to be worse with prolonged infection than with recurrent infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and animal-derived, via excess infection.

A study for the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest onset of symptoms as December 1, 2019.
The official release from WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms was on 8 December 2019.

These figures vary by region and by time and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the duration since the initial transmission and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.

According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed as dying from the disease, and infectious mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are time-independent and follow a particular population from infection to resolution.
While not everyone develops antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about the number of people who are infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread by carnival parties, and transmission to younger people, resulted in comparatively lower mortality rates, and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified as such.
Plus, the German health care system is still not overrated.
In the Netherlands, at least 3% may have antibodies as assessed from blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rates are different for men and women.
The higher mortality rates for men in studies carried out in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the gap between men and women only opening at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate is 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact causes for this sex difference are unknown but genetic and behavioral factors may be the cause.
Immunological differences based on sex, lack of smoking prevalence in women and men forming co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than females may contribute to higher mortality rates in males.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals are male and 72% of total COVID-19 deaths are male.
As of April 2020, the US government does not track sex-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women and they have a higher exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that the abbreviations CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for the time of the outbreak were first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at avoiding stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19) in public communications.
Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".

In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as provisional names for viruses and diseases in line with 2015 guidance on the use of locations for diseases and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on 11 February 2020.

In one example, when an Italian hospital needed ventilator valves urgently, and the supplier couldn't deliver them in the required time scale, a local engineering startup turned around and produced the 100 needed valves overnight.

Man has the ability to spread the virus to several other animals.
The study failed to find any evidence of viral replication in rodents, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.

In March, the World Health Organization started the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the effects of the current four antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.

Previous efforts on SARS-CoV are being used as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to build a vaccine for the virus as a whole.
The use of either inactive or dead viruses is intended to obtain an immediate immune response in the human body to new infections with COVID-19.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create vaccines that are immune-sensitive to certain viral subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focused on the S adhesion protein which helps the virus to invade the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a novel technique for creating a single vaccination).

The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. The increased antibody dependence has been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluated for approval as a treatment for malaria, including four trials on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The purpose-modified antiviral drug covered most of China's research, with nine phase III trials on remdesivir for some countries to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates is available, as of April 2020. Several current antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is tentative evidence for efficacy by remdesivir as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, used to treat malaria was previously studied in China in February 2020, giving preliminary results.

Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to screen for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for further in vivo studies after showing low-concentration intensification in SARS-CoV-2. The study showed that early enhancement protein detection by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) was important for SARS-CoV-2 entry via interaction with ACE2 receptors.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin has major limitations that prevent the medical community from using these therapies without further study.
Cytokin storms can be complications in the next stage for severe COVID-19.
Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing a non-random phase 2 trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results with severe illness.
Combined with serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storm, this is meant to fight the progression, which is thought to be the cause of death for some infected people.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroidal refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by different causes, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring toned and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who recover from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method for passive immunization.
This strategy was tried on SARS without any conclusive results.
Neutralization of the virus is the anticipated mechanism of action whereby passive antibody therapy may be a defensive mediator against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms however, such as cellular cytotoxicity antibody dependence and/or phagocytosis are possible.
Another form of passive antibody therapy, for example, using monoclonal antibodies produced is in development.
The production of recovery serum, which consists of the fluid portion of the blood from recovering patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus can be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus, a group of closely related syndromes.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, later became infected and died due to COVID-19 after raising awareness about the transmission of the virus.
