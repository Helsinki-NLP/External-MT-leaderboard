Welsh AM worries about 'looking like Muppets'
Some AMs are skeptical about the suggestion of changing their titles to MWPs.
This suspicion has been raised by plans to rename the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The AM of various political parties is concerned that this change will be tangled.
One worker AM said that his group was concerned that the title "sounds like Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: twp means fool in Welsh and pwp means shit.
A plaid AM said the whole group was "displeased" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but he noted that the MWP to Muppet was a minor verbal abuse.
In this context, the Welsh alphabet is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the legislation to initiate the name change, said: "The final decision on any description of what to name the members of the Assembly will of course be up to the members".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the findings of a public consultation on these proposals which showed widespread support for the Assembly to be named a Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of AM, the Commission favoured the Welsh Members of Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
The AMs are of course suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach a consensus could be a headache for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to introduce a draft law on the changes in a few weeks.
The amendments to the Act will include other changes to the working procedures of the Assembly, including rules on the ineligibility of AMs and structure of committee system.
The AM will discuss the bill and will make a final decision on the question of what to call them.
Macedonians will vote for the referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is aimed at resolving a decades-old conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is meant to represent their territory, and has consistently opposed attempts to give it to EU and NATO members.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the name change, said that the vote would be ignored.
But, including Prime Minister Zoran Zhao, the supporters of the sovereignty claim that the name change is only the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's fell silent as the Harlem church struggled
"Historically, the older people I spoke to said there was a bar and a discussion on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
"Today, none of it".
He said that it is understandable that the bars have disappeared.
"People come together in different ways", he said, nowadays.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people go regularly".
As for the Church, they worry that the money from the sale of properties will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later it will return to the starting point".
He further said that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings, which would be filled with condominiums filled with people who do not help the neighbouring shelters.
"The majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white", he said, "and so the time will come soon for the church to close down completely because most of the people who come to live in these condominiums are unlikely to be members of the church".
Both churches were built by white groups before becoming a metropolitan community - the black city of Harlem - in 1870, a decade after St. Martin.
The original white Methodist group came out in the 1930s.
A group of black people who were praying nearby took over the building.
A group of blacks took over St. Martin's under the leadership of the Rev. John Howard, who had led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, and opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but the parishioners of Father Johnson planned to rebuild it, starting the Carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly named the carillon "The Poor People's Bell".
In July, the carillon's expert called it "a cultural treasure" and "a unique historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, also noted that the black carillon, played by Dionysio A. Lind, was the world's first carillon, having made its debut in a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Meriwether said that St. Martin had not replaced him.
What happened in St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, brought in part by church leaders, and partly by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Vestry - the parish's board of directors, composed of general leaders - expressed concern in writing to the diocese in July that the diocese would attempt to delegate "the matter of expenses" to Vestry, however Vestry was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark on a lobster drive in California.
Officials said that a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by sharks on Saturday while hunting for lobsters on the first day of the lobster harvest.
The attack took place at 7 am near the beach of Bikons in Encinitas.
Chad Hammell told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help and he and a group went to him and helped him out of the water.
Hamlony said that at first he thought it was a joke to catch the lobster, but then he "found out that it was screaming, it had bitten me!
I've been bitten!'
"He had his whole shoulder bone removed", he realized after Hamlony rescued the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" said Hamlone.
The boy was airlifted to the Ready Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is said to be in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack has not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that the shark had been seen in the area a few weeks ago, but had been determined to be a non-threatening species.
Giles said the boy suffered severe injuries to the upper body.
Officials closed access to the beach from Panto Beach in Casablanca to Swamij in Asinitas for 48 hours for inspection and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not endangered.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, SuperDrug and DeBannhams through the hiring of department store-style Beauty Isles expert assistants.
As part of a massive push into the UK's £2.8bn cosmetics market, which is growing steadily as fashion and homeware sales decline, larger beauty eyels will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
While supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space once used by TVs, microwaves and homeware, investments are coming in cosmetics.
Sainsbury's said that it will double its cosmetics portfolio to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Twisterman and Dr. For the first time, PawPaw.
The current ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in the branded parts found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique makeup range so that most products are vegetarian-friendly, with an increasing demand from young shoppers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrans Shop will be offering discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week at Croydon in South London, while the second will open later this year at Selly Oak, Birmingham.
The trend towards online shopping and smaller daily purchases at local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do a lot to attract people.
Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Koop, said that these outlets will increasingly look like department stores while supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl are trying to counter the discounters with more service and non-food items.
Sainsbury is setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also launched several habitats since they bought both these chains two years ago, which they believe have been successful in boosting grocery sales.
The supermarket's previous attempt to reshape its beauty and pharmacy departments had failed.
Sainsbury's piloted a joint venture with Boots in 2000, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to split revenue from chemist stores in its supermarkets.
The new policy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for £125m three years ago.
He said that Lloyds will play a role in this scheme by including a wide range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Pose and Vichy in the four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, says: "We have redesigned our beauty isles to create an environment that is more welcoming to our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to advise.
Our range of brands is tailored to each individual need and with attractive atmosphere and convenient locations, we are attractive beauty destinations that challenge the old shopping patterns".
Peter Jones 'flamed' after Holly Willowby pulled out of £11million deal
'Dragons Den star Peter Jones 'inflamed' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an £11m deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Wiloby doesn't have time for his homeware and accessories brand Truly.
The business is compared to Paltro's underground brand in Guyana.
The morning presenter, 37, said on Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has pulled out of her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute, firing up Dragons Den star Peter Jones and focusing on her new grand contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was "inflamed", according to sources, when the TV star confessed in a tense meeting at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, that her new deal - worth £1.5 million - meant she no longer had time to focus on her homeware and accessories brand Truly.
The business is compared to Paltro's Gup brand in Guyana and is estimated to double Billoby's wealth to £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain by jet and headed to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was still at the top of Holi's priority list.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would have made her successful in the next decade or two.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, so close to the opening.
There's a warehouse at Marlowe headquarters full of items that are ready to sell".
Experts say that the departure of one of Britain's most trusted stars, This Morning, will cost the firm millions of dollars in huge investments in products ranging from cushions to candles and from clothing to homewares, and could delay its launch even further.
And it could also be the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for the past ten years.
Truly was founded in 2016 along with Willoughby Capp and Jones, and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
The couple vacation together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on these business developments".
We had a long talk and then we fell in love.
Some people said he made fun of the media criticism of the president for his "depraved" comments and his positive attitude towards the North Korean president.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his fake "news anchor" style.
"I have not given up anything".
He noted that Kim is keen for a second meeting after Trump praised the initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korean disarmament.
But the disarmament talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong, told UN world leaders at the General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not seem to be getting an "anti-human response" from the United States to its efforts to disarm North Korea early.
Instead, he noted that the US is continuing to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump expressed a more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are going very well", he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great divine bond".
Our efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: rocket tests have stopped, the resolution of the Olissa is being helped, and the rest of the American personnel are returning home.
And he supported my unusual approach to talking about my relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people into this crowded space, it's better to have about 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing in front of him with a small finger.
Indonesia Tsunami and earthquake devastated an island, killing hundreds
After the Lompoc earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they didn't need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lompoc has been relocated, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it very clear that we are not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging", said Ms. Sumbang.
Save the Children is forming a team to go to Palo, while it is not yet clear whether foreign staff will be able to work in the field.
The National Disaster Institute spokesman, Mr. Sutopo, said that Indonesian authorities are studying the situation in Palu to see if foreign entities can be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Indonesia is not prepared for the natural disasters, given the frequent earthquakes.
Although tsunami nets have been constructed in Asai, they are not easily found on other coastlines.
Although a warning was given earlier, a tsunami warning siren in Palu was not issued, which could have caused loss of life.
In the best of times, it is challenging to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make relief work more complex.
A hospital set up to treat earthquake victims in Lombok is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crisis site.
President Joko Widodo has brought the issue of improving Indonesia's decaying infrastructure to the forefront of his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial shortcomings that are plaguing Mr. Joko's administration, meanwhile, are also a challenge for him to stand for re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of Indonesia's long-standing ethnic tensions, in which the Muslim majority members have chosen a more narrow faith path.
Christian and Muslim gangs using picks, arrows and bows, and other village weapons, clashed in the streets, killing over 1,000 people and displacing thousands from their homes.
See: Daniel Sturges of Liverpool draws against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday to save Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea.
Sturridge were 1-0 down, and he got a pass from Sheridan Shakiri, about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal.
He tapped the ball on his left side and then took a shot at a distant post.
His attempt went up the box and fell into the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball passed the catcher Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get in that position, get on the ball and players like Veget are always playing forwards as much as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible for myself", Sturgeon told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kent coming and I touched him once and didn't think much about it and just shot him".
Chelsea had a 1-0 lead until halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker then sent a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, then scored near midfield and scored in Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made an instant give-and-go on midfield.
Then he hit a nice one, so Hazard went into the box.
Hazard broke through the defence and finished his game by seeing Liverpool's Alison Baker throw a left footed shot into the far post.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3pm at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videotron in the UEFA Europa League in London on Thursday at 3pm.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
The 7.5 magnitude quake on Friday reportedly left many people trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings and caused waves of up to 20 feet to erupt, said the organization's spokesman, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, at a news conference.
In the city of Palo, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, the ruins of the buildings are now a pile of rubble.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of killing a woman by strangulation
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of the 44-year-old woman was found with head injuries at 7.55am on John Street at Grayson Mews, a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have appealed to the people in the area to come forward if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'This investigation is in its early stages but I urge anyone in the John Street area in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who have caught anything on the dashcam footage to contact us as they may have vital information for our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was a resident of Birkenhead and her body was found inside a building.
Friends who claimed to know this woman came to the scene this afternoon and were asking about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and we have informed the next of kin of the deceased woman.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews was trying to get into his flat but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or pass through the building.
He was silent when he realized what had happened.
Residents were told that they would be allowed back into the building in several hours.
Now a police officer was heard telling someone that the whole area has been designated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, crying.
She kept saying, 'It's very bad.'
At 2 pm, two police vans were inside the encirclement and another van was outside.
Several officers were standing inside the siege and guarding the blocks of flats.
If anyone has any information, they should give it to DM @MerPolCC or call 101 or contact CrimeStoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 by mentioning log 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament is a recent monument to the debate over whether history is rewritten.
Removing him would be poetic justice, as his hard-headed puritan followers have orchestrated the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artworks.
But the Cromwell Society has called Mr. Crick's suggestion "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: "It was natural that the current debate over the removal of the puppet would be a victim of the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster.
The glory of the English Civil War was not something that Cromwell had asked for or even brought about.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft's grand description of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th-century view and is part of the historical graph of this figure that many still believe to be venerable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more than many people today, in the late 19th century thought that Cromwell was more a supporter of parliament than of external pressure, of course, of monarchy in his case.
Whether this description is completely accurate has been the subject of continuous historical debate.
One thing is certain: the conflicts of the mid-17th century have shaped the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell is a personally recognizable figure who represents one side of that valley.
His performance as Lord Protector is also celebrated and memorable".
A Chinese farmer was killed by a masked pig
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, local media reported.
The man, whose surname is "Yuan", was found dead with a ruptured blood vessel in a bloodstained pile at a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm in Shining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
It was reported that he had come to this market with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he found the door to the nearby pigsty open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the cage with blood on its mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had killed the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's feet were bloody and dirty", said the other brother, whose surname was "Wu", as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
According to security camera footage, Yuan entered the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone, and police are gathering evidence from the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this is rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig ran over a Welsh farmer on his tract, and his wife kicked the pig out.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but the taste of blood can "irritate" them.
"They are just playing games.
They're hoods, they're very creative -- they're not meant to hurt you.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve", he said.
Rosa is expected to cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, Rosa is decreasing in intensity as it moves into colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floodwaters to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa's winds reached 85 mph on Sunday at 5 a.m. eastern time, making it a Category 1 storm and it is 385 kilometers southwest of Punta Ugania.
On Sunday, Ross is expected to move north.
Meanwhile, a Pacific Ocean bubble is beginning to take shape and is heading east toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa Baja moves toward the California Peninsula on Monday, it will begin to push deep temperate moisture northward across the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Later, the coming swell will combine with the temperate humidity to create extensive heavy rainfall in the southwest region in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall is expected to cause dangerous flooding, debris spilling and possibly desert landslides.
Deep temperate humidity will result in rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in some areas, especially in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona.
In the southwest, especially, most of Arizona is expected to experience 2 to 4 inches of rain.
The disruptive nature of the monsoon rains can lead to sudden flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
It is very dangerous to go out on foot in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into muddy rivers, and local winds and dust can cause the formation of mud.
The approaching cyclone will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the Southern California coast.
More than half an inch of rain is possible, so that a small amount of debris can flow and the roads become slippery.
This may be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Some showers will hit Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, followed by widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue till Wednesday.
As the Arctic cools, temperatures may fluctuate slightly in October, but the temperate zone will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature over short periods of time.
Sunday is a major example of dramatic temperature change in Central America.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will rise and expand again.
A warm start is expected in early October with highs in the 80s from the southern plateau to the northeastern regions across much of the central and eastern United States.
New York City's temperatures could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the normal average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests a higher than average temperature for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial
The emotional testimony Thursday by Supreme Court appointee Brad Kevenough and the woman who allegedly sexually assaulted him in the 1980s, Christine Blasé Ford, was watched by more than 20 million people, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, with the political patch in place, broadcasters on Friday cut short regular programming by pulling out at the last minute: an agreement brokered by Arizona Sen: FBI's Jeff Flake will handle the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kevin caught him drunk at a high school party and tried to take his clothes off.
Kevenough, in his most emotional testimony, said that he was 100% sure that nothing like this had happened.
More than 20.4 million people are expected to have seen the testimony on Friday, Nelson reported.
The company is measuring the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other networks that aired the show, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nelson usually has some trouble counting the number of people who watch in offices.
In this respect, it is the same number of spectators as for a playoff football match or an Academy Awards.
Fox News, a strong supporter of Kevenou's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the daylong hearing, Nelson said.
ABC was the second most watched channel with 3.26 million viewers.
He said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
After the hearing, the curiosity reached its peak.
Flake was the centre of attraction in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kevenow, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS as protesters protested against him on Friday morning as he headed to Geneva for a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there for several minutes with his eyes closed, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think they are telling the truth to the country?
They were told, "When all these women are powerless, you have power".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator was shut down, that we had more to say at the committee hearing.
When the Judiciary Committee was to vote to send Kevenno's nomination to the full Senate for a vote, the cable and broadcast networks broadcast it all hours later.
But Flake said that we would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, which the minority Democrats are pushing for.
Flake was partly convinced by his conversation with his mentor, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After discussions with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The Flake election had power, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kevenno without a test.
The FBI has opened an investigation into the allegations made against Kevenau by President Trump.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of 'politicising' the Brexit vote
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper accused critics of "politicizing" the future of Britain and downplaying the national interest in her plan to leave the European Union.
Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom has arrived in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 20th September, 2018 to attend the Congress of the People's Party.
In another of his front-page interviews, his former foreign secretary Boris Johnson further attacked his alleged checkered plan for Brexit, calling the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's taxes "completely unreliable".
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dighton Simpson in the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old basketball player, Wade Sims, at LSU.
Dietion Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
The video of Sims and Simpson fighting was released by authorities, and police said Sims' glasses were lost in the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting and killing the man.
His bond was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the death was due to a gunshot wound to the head.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, The State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and the community for assisting in the investigation and arresting the suspect.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Aleva thanked the regional legislatures for their "profound and righteous pursuit".
Seams was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "devastated" by Wade's death and "shocked".
"This is what I'm constantly worried about", Wade said.
The volcanoes of Mexico City are covered with ash.
Ashes from the Pocketpetel volcano have reached the southern vicinity of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after it began moving rapidly in its remnants on Saturday, releasing 183 loads of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The centre was used to monitor many tremors and tremors.
Pictures of car windows in nearby cities like Shochimalco, Mexico City, were on social media.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the area of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
A clash broke out between police and Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence of the republic.
In Barcelona, six people were arrested after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined rival protests on the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization vote on secession.
Riot police stopped a group of masked separatists, who threw eggs and paint, causing clouds of dust to collect on the streets crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, when the chukkak was blown, the police used batons to bring it to the police station.
For hours pro-independence groups chanted "Neither forget nor forgive", while the pro-unificationists chanted "Long live Spain".
Local media reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries in the clash.
For a year, the region of independent thought was under a state of paralytic tension after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considered illegal but which the separatist Catalans celebrated.
Voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the voter turnout was reduced by the boycott of the vote by those who opposed partition.
According to the Catalan administration, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop voting at polling stations during violent clashes across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped out all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but he was forced to take a different path.
Narcisse Termis, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's chances of independence.
"We had a very good time last year.
I saw tears of joy in my parents' eyes when I voted, but we are stuck", he said.
Despite a minor but significant victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum this year, with many of their popular leaders either voluntarily assuming anonymity or being placed on standby pending trial for their role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
John Pig, a 42-year-old mechanic, gave his opinion on the phone about the protests in support of the police, saying that the struggle was supported by politicians on both sides.
"This conflict is becoming increasingly tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the mockery of our government by the Spanish government", he said.
London: Men arrested after car break-in
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested for repeatedly breaking into a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident occurred at about 19:30 BST on Thursday in the Ballinagrad Crescent.
The entrance and the building were also damaged, said department inspector Bob Blemings.

The attack by Menga gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston was the decisive victory
Promoted Livingston stunned Rangers by handing Steven Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Iberrocks.
The Dolly Menga attack turned the tables and Gary Holt's team tied with Hibernian in the second round.
Gerard's side went winless in the Premiership this season and next Sunday, they will face Hearts, who are eight points behind.
Before that, on Thursday, Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston, who will continue their unbeaten run of six games in the division, have not seen defeat since their coach Holt took over from Kenny Myler last month.
Livingston took a chance against the visiting team of Boathot
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before they scored, because their precise shot had completely put the Rangers in a bind.
Scott Robinson broke the cycle but he crouched in front of the goal, then after Alan Lithgow moved Craig Holcett into the head goal, he was only able to expand his effort.
The hosts knew they could put the visitors in trouble, so they were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them.
And in this way, it became a crucial goal.
The Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston got a free kick, and the Declan Garage and Robinson pair backed Menga, who took possession of the ball and scored through the middle of the box.
By then, the Rangers had dominated, but the opposing defense was invincible, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not hurt.
The same pattern would continue in the second half, however Alfredo Morelos had to make a defense from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's feet snapped Scott Pittman and Lithgow sent the ball even further away from Livingston.
Crosses kept coming into Livingston's box and they kept getting removed, while two penalty claims - Halcett's challenge to player Glenn Middleton - and one for handball were left.
The Bible says: "The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom".
The BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lemont is at Tony MacCorney Arena
A great game and result for Livingston.
For the men, they played very well, they exceeded expectations towards this progress.
His style of play and players have hardly changed since his return from the top flight, but he should be given a lot of credit for the way he has shaped the team since Holt's arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halcett played hard, led a well-constructed defense, while the pack kept up the fight with Connor Goldson and Joe Voral.
However, the Rangers were under-motivated.
The more they were under Gerard's guidance, the less they fell below their standard game.
His final game was a poor one, only one time he beat the home team, and it was a warning to the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
The Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday, September 29, with a cheerful atmosphere.
The visit is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership in the EU.
Later, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a grand new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from crowding in front of the mosque, but many supporters had gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of people who protested against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also raised their voices, denouncing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome their country.
The split image of these visitors, who were seen as heroes by some German Turks and despised by others as dictators, was reflected in the double demonstrations.
Deptford road accident: bicyclist killed after collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident, a busy street in Deptford, occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, in the southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and paramedics helped, but the cyclist died at the scene.
This is the second accident in a few months after a cyclist was killed in a collision on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said that they are working to identify the deceased and notify his next of kin.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been diverted and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lathin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
The prison office said six prison officers were injured after a riot in a high-security men's prison.
The riots started at 09:30 BST on Sunday at HMP Long Martin and are ongoing.
Specialist Tornado officers have been called in to deal with the riot, which involved eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The officers suffered minor facial injuries and were treated.
A prison service spokesperson said: "Special trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the incident at HMP Long Lardin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be sent to the police and they will have to spend more time in jail".
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous defendants in the country.
In June, the prison governor was told he had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And riot police were called in to handle a serious riot in October last year, in which workers were attacked with pull balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are at risk of sudden flooding due to Rosa (probable to benefit storm areas)
It is rare for a tropical low pressure belt to hit Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen next week as Cyclone Rosa moves southwest into the desert with the rest of its strength, putting the risk of sudden flooding on the line.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City on Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday Ross is expected to head straight for Phoenix, with late rain on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained their status or low pressure belt within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was 40 miles from the Arizona border".
The latest forecast from the National Hurricane Center is 2 to 4 inches of rain, with up to 6 inches of rainfall in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the desert southwest including the Central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches, while the Turlak areas are likely to receive up to 4 inches.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, the rainfall from the thunderstorm will be beneficial as the region is hit by drought.
While flooding is a concern, a little rain can be beneficial as the Southwest is currently facing a drought situation.
According to the U.S. Drow Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing low-intensity drought, the second highest category", weather.com reports.
First, Rosa will make its way to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa's winds reached a peak of 85 mph on Sunday, and it was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and was heading north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing colder waters in the Pacific, which is reducing its strength.
Thus, it is expected to reach Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall could occur in parts of Mexico, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"We are expecting 3 to 6 inches of rain from Baja California to northwest Sonora, which could be as high as 10 inches", weather.com reports.
Rosa will then move as a tropical low pressure belt in the early morning of Tuesday before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical storm north of Mexico, which will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main threat from the effects of Rosa or its remnants is severe rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
The rainfall is likely to be deadly and lead to the release of debris from deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested on murder charges
Three minors and a man aged 20 have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.
The minor was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he was reported to be in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man from the Radstock area were arrested overnight, Somerset Police said.
The officials have urged all those who have mobile footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump called Kevano a "selfish, angry" Democrat.
"One vote for Justice Kevenau is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's brutal and provocative behavior", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Caveno was surrounded by the "selfishness, anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his candidacy process.
Kevinou testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and passionately denying allegations that he sexually abused Christine Blasey Ford as a minor.
Ford also confirmed his accusation at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the intelligence and quality and courage of Kevin" that day.
"The confirmation vote for Justice Kevenough is the confirmation vote for one of the most successful legal scholars of our time, a judge with a distinguished career in public service", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president made a reference to Keven's candidacy in a non-consensual way, while talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not standing, but I'm really standing", he said.
"That's why I'm fighting the big candidates everywhere".
Trump claimed that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
A senior GOP leadership aide told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kevenno's nomination is expected by Friday.
Indonesia earthquake, tsunami, hundreds of dead, death toll is rising
At least 384 people have been killed and many more have been washed away, officials said on Saturday, after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the coast of Indonesia's Sulawesi island.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the shores of the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) hit the shore, killing many and destroying everything in the way.
The tsunami came after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were doing their jobs on the shore and they didn't leave immediately and they were killed", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency BNPB, to reporters in Jakarta.
"This tsunami did not come alone, it was dragging cars, sheds, houses, everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled at 800 kph (497 mph) over the open ocean before hitting the coast.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palo.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Management Agency showed several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Even after that, the coastal city was still hit by the earthquake on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in this region where 2.4 million people live.
Indonesia's Bureau of Assessment and Technology Applications (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits on the tip of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that some bodies of people trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings have been found, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the number of casualties and damage could be higher in the area called Donggala, 300 kilometers north of Palu, which was close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely disrupted", with no communication from the donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people lived here", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a crisis, but it could get worse", it says.
Officials said the tsunami had occurred within the period of the warning, but the agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami to Palu.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man standing on top of a building warning people on the street below of an approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shore, sweeping buildings and trains away.
The footage could not be immediately confirmed by Reuters.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages and disruption of communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but the rescued people are in dire need of food and other basic amenities.
The city airport has been reopened for relief operations only and will remain closed till October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the rescue centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has reached 800.
This is very bad.
World Vision staff have safely arrived in Palu City where staff have set up a newsstand in their office premises, he said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
This is very bad.
While relief teams are starting their preparations for disaster response, some have complained that experienced foreign aid workers are being forced to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, only foreign funds, supplies and personnel can go to a disaster site if it has been declared a national disaster area.
That has not happened yet.
"Adhapan is a provincial disaster", said Alia Ariani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Why once the government said, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we would open up for international aid, but that's not the case yet".
As the second night after the earthquake and tsunami hit in Palu on Friday, friends and family of the missing still hope that miracles will find their loved ones, as such stories are found in natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the cliff for two days with her mother's body.
The Indonesian national paraglider team coach, Gendeng Subandono, said that two paragliders who were training for the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month are missing.
Shri Mandy said that among those who were trapped in Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
As a veteran of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Shri said that within hours of the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spreading to the paragliding community, he had hastily sent a WhatsApp message to the Palu contestants participating in the Beach Festival.
However, their messages, instead of two blue dots, only had one faint dot.
"I think that means they didn't get the messages", he said.
Thieves took $26,750 from an ATM in Levy, Newport.
While Levi was paying into an ATM in Newport, thieves stole $26,750 from a brink employee on Friday morning, the Newport Police Department said in a news release.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to bring in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the newspaper.
While he was busy, another man "ran after the Brink's employee" and ran off with a bag of money for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, the paper said, but police did not give the exact number of people involved in the incident.
If anyone has any information about their identity, please contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: The rapper changed his name to "E".
Rapper Kenny West has changed his name to "Y".
Announcing the change on Saturday, he wrote on Twitter: "It was formally called the Kanye West".
West, 41, had been nicknamed Ye for a while and had taken the moniker for his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Windy.
The singer Ariana Grande is coming to the show in place of the singer who left the show, the producer said, "for emotional reasons".
As an abbreviation of his current business name, West has previously stated that the word is religiously important to him.
"I think 'it' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am you, you.
This change from Kenya, which is unique, it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
This album is more of a reflection of who we are".
This is one of the popular rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known by various names like Puff Daddy, P. Daddy or Didi, but this year he announced that we like the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West coordinator, J-Z, has also made the same change with or without a hyphen and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians on the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday at Lateloco Plaza that he would "never use the military to bully Mexicans".
On October 2, 1868, soldiers opened fire on peaceful protesters, killing about 300 people, as a leftist student movement took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support educated young Mexicans with monthly subsidies and open more free public universities.
He said that youths are turning to gangs due to unemployment and lack of educational opportunities.
The US should double its funding for AI.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area, according to investor and AI businessman Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The US does not have a formal AI policy, and this reaction comes after announcements about AI by various departments of the US government.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year, which aims to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling AI research budgets would be a good start, because all other countries are way behind the United States, and we're looking forward to the next revolution in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding will double the chances of the next big breakthrough in AI in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovention Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent AI companies.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-rated American Othello Player, and later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China division.
Lee mentioned previous US government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when the next competition will be held, to help in the search for the next future people.
Researchers in the United States have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"China is not taking away academics, it's hiring corporations", Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited celebrities from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Li said that the changes in immigration policy will also help the US to strengthen its efforts in AI.
"I think that the PhD in AI should be automatically given green cards.
The State Council of China released its next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of the United States and other government agencies fund researchers in the same way that China's National Natural Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions, but the quality of academic work in China is poor, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a joint AI center to train partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced it's investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
In the case of the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, a US law aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve their decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, which they insist is a claim to its territory by our northern neighbor and has used its veto to deny the country's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and that the boycott campaign raised doubts that the voter turnout would be at least 50 percent of the required number to validate the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot is: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price to pay for Macedonia to pursue entry into institutions like the EU and NATO, a country that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
I have come today to vote for the future of my country, the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the same umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Giorgivesca, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
While not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that we will abide by the outcome of the vote to make it final.
The name change will require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Election Commission said that as of 1 pm there was no irregularity.
However, the voting was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their ballots.
I'm out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Jos Taniewski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in a referendum on changing the country's name on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, which will open the country's door to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, a 54-year-old housewife, is setting up a small platform and laying the foundation stone in front of the tents set up for the boycotters.
We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join firmly, not through the back door", Kavardarkov said.
Our country is poor, but we have pride.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia coordination".
Prime Minister Zhao said that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, as it has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I think a majority of people will support it because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zhao said after the vote.
He said that if the result is "yes", it will be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - a lower percentage than the required.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV showed that 57 percent of people were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
To be successful, the referendum needs to be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow to the policy of the West-Dharjini government that came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero makes his way through the whole Brighton defence for a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Stirling led Manchester City to a 2-0 victory over Brighton on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute was very easy.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the starting line-up and in midfield.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed the ball around one of the defenders and then hit several of them in the Brighton box.
Then he pushed a pass to his left, and there was Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball with his first touch in the box, using his right boot to hit Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan and hit the right side of the net.
Aguero has some problems with his feet", City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We were saying he plays for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment".
But in the Stirling Premier League match, the Sky Blues took the lead.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in the Brighton area.
He sent the ball to Leroy Sen from the left side in a beautiful way.
Sen took a few touches and then led Sterling towards the distant post.
This Sky Blues forward tapped the ball into the net just before he went out of bounds.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12.55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sünheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the series, there was little reason to start another strong start.
But the ever-competitive Sherzerna is expected to challenge the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but if it still pays to play a series game for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still waiting to fight for their first division title.
"Even though we're not playing for anything, knowing that Denver is going to be a busy place, we're going to be able to at least come up with a rubber and play another team at a higher level than I've ever faced at any point this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but they may be rumoured to be inclined to let Scherzer come in at such an occasion.
Scherzer, who will be his 34th start, had a bullpen session on Thursday and will be watching his usual Sunday sleep.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA this season and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump took a rally in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of Republican presence in the midterm elections, the President pointed to the indicative situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kevenno.
Everything we have done will be tested in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
This is one of the biggest, biggest -- I'm not fighting, but I'm really fighting, so I'm going everywhere for the big candidates.
Trump went on to say, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see this is all happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by any means necessary, you see this selfishness, this brutality.
They don't care who we hurt, who we crush to gain power and control, so they want power and control, and we're not going to give it to them".
He said that the Democrats are on a campaign to "resist and block".
And you've seen it for the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and selfish and cruel and lying".
He referred to the fact that the Senate Judiciary Committee had given a score to Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which was met with a roar from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you open the document?
Ah, ah, what.
No, no, I'm waiting. It was a really bad body language. It was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer a broad church.
He does not tolerate what his heart says
When the activists in my party at Momentum voted to convict me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a line of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome just for speaking our minds.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she took a strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn on the conviction.
On the importance of national security, on the importance of a responsible economic policy for Europe, these are the very issues that unfortunately Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
Nottingham East Labour stated at a meeting on Friday that "we want to be inclusive and productive in meetings".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were the same.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings do not have that atmosphere, and the promise of "more kind, more civil", if ever, politically, has been forgotten.
It is increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each vote is being weighed against whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became Leader, because colleagues who had expressed similar political views before started expressing expectations that I would go around and take a role that I would never have otherwise agreed to -- whether it was national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- there's a wave of social media scandals about me being voted out, criticism of the central politics, being told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
In fact, I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the reactions to me are political in nature.
I am amazed at the professional and determined nature of friends who do not hesitate to face the daily rain of sexual or racist slurs.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era of politics is the increasingly common level of profanity.
Jeremy Corbyn last week suggested that Labour should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so liberal that the party will collapse with every motion of no confidence or change in the electoral rules.
I've been getting a lot of advice over the last couple of years, including being told to keep my head down and not say more, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not what I came to politics for.
Shocked by the fact that my school class was literally collapsed by the negligence of the Thatcher government, ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, as a local councillor or as a government minister, I have demanded better public service provision for those who are most in need.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be confused in any way about the position of my policies and the area of disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the motion on Friday, I would just like to say that the way the country is moving towards Brexit, which will have a negative impact on families, businesses and our social services, I cannot understand the willingness to waste time and energy on my devotion to the Labour leader.
But the truth is, the message I have is not for the Nottingham movement, it is for my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no amount of threats of dismissal or political justification will deter me from my work, which I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East.
Iron 38  17 Melrose: Undefeated Iron reaches the top
The delayed two tries may have had a slightly negative impact on the final result, but there is no doubt that the Irish amazing-fun tenants deserved a win in this all-day match in the Premiership.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team in the top ten.
After all, their defense was as good as their excellent skill at taking chances, which gave the local team and coach Peter Merchi every right to be happy.
"We have been tested so much for our game and we are still undefeated, so I am happy", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "The credit goes to Iron, who took advantage of the opportunities better than we did".
A 14th-minute try by Grant Anderson, driven by Fraser Climo, gave the Irish the lead, but a yellow card released by the Warriors for Scotland captain Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to score and Jason Baggott pulled an irreversible try.
Climo took the lead with a penalty at half-time, then he returned a single try to give the Irish a 17-5 lead at half-time.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half, and Baggett, backing Patrick Anderson's Trial, narrowed the gap by five points.
Then a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who was taken off the stretcher, and the restart of the Iron Stafford McDowell trial was further delayed by a climb.
The Irish's season captain, Blair McPherson, was later given a yellow card, and again, Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unchanged Bruce Colvin's try at the end of a very tense left.
Later the home team came back, but, and Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card while tackling Climo from the penalty line-out without the ball and McPherson scored a touchdown over the forward.
After David Armstrong's box kick was caught by Kyle Rowe and sent away to flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth try of the home team, Climo converted him as he had done at the re-opening.
Steel Game Star is looking to try his hand in the hotel industry.
After learning that Steel Game star Ford Kernan had been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company, he took the step of turning to the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he wrote and co-starred in with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth series of the ongoing show will be the final one, and Kirn is planning their lives after his work in Craigslist.
According to the formal record listing, he is a director of Adriftmorne Limited.
Although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiran would be joining Glasgow's booming restaurant business, the actor declined to comment on the matter.
The sea is ours: the court hopes land-locked Bolivia will open the way to the Pacific.
The sailors patrol the rigging-clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
Sky-colored flags are flown over public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon to the bottom of the naval base, the following slogan is written: "We have a right to the sea".
It is our duty to achieve it.
All over land-locked Bolivia, the memory of the beaches lost in the bloody 19th century conflict with Chile over resources is still alive - as if the hope of sailing the Pacific Ocean once more is still there.
Those hopes are perhaps the pinnacle of this decade, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has momentum, unity and courage, and of course, we expect positive results from the outcome", said Roberto Cazedilla, Ambassador of Bolivia.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on the big screen across the country, in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will rule on Bolivia's claim that after decades of ups and downs of negotiations, Chile has accepted the responsibility to negotiate for Bolivia's autonomous access to the sea.
Bolivia's charming local president Evo Morales, who is facing a controversial re-election bid next year, also has his future largely tied to Monday's vote.
At the end of August, he promised, "We are very close to returning to the Pacific".
But some analysts say the court's decision in favor of Bolivia is unlikely to change the situation much.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no authority to give Chile territory, and has contracted that it will not decide the outcome of any potential talks.
The final debate, which took place only six months after the ICJ was elected, indicated that the case was not "complex", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And in moving forward for the sake of Bolivia, the last four years have probably pushed it back.
The issue of gaining access to the sea route has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, Zarrate said.
Morales's aggressive rhetoric has destroyed what remains of Chile's reputation, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will start negotiations at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, has dismissed the court's unusual dynamic decision-making process.
He said that on Monday, Bolivia will have a wonderful opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and to bring an end to 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits.
Morales remains Latin America's most popular leader, which Calzodilla denied, saying he was using the maritime issue as a political ploy.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
This result is an opportunity to see what needs to be overcome.
North Korea says it will not denuclearize unless it trusts the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Re Yong Ho said that if his country does not trust Washington, it will never disarm its nuclear weapons in the first place.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United Nations to honour the pledges made during the Singapore meeting between the rivals.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stands on the brink of resuming stagnant nuclear politics more than three months after meeting North Korean Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "illusion" that kept the sanctions and U.S. objections to a declaration that would end the Korean War and bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is aware of the fact that Pyongyang has ratified the declaration without first taking a step towards significant disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is much doubt that Pyongyang is serious about releasing its library, as the country sees this as the only guarantee for its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion show, we introduced the latest range of giant accessories to a major street near you.
If you want to increase your hat collection or get full protection from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brownie introduced a range of large-sized caps for their SS19 collections, which set the curtain on the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, some of the most unrealistic hats have made their presence felt on Instagram, and these designers have sent their spectacular creations for catwalks.
One of Valentino's distinctive pieces was an over-the-top pink hat, adorned with a wide, pincer-like brim that adorned the models' heads beautifully.
Other larger accessories included a jewel-decorated necklace, a magic hat, and a pineapple inside -- but they weren't designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Browney also introduced a series of extraordinary masks - and that too just in time for Halloween.
Many coloured masks were sewn on the lips and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high fashion.
One design was like scuba diving gear, with a fan and goggles, while the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you can use this huge fashion statement -- you're in luck.
Observers of these styles predicted that these hats could be found in large numbers on the main road near you.
The enormous-sized hats were seen rising on tall heels, with two-foot-wide edges, on the heads of all the people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajovsky.
The communal symbol behind these highly impractical hats, which was named on social media, was sent for another big catwalk - a straw beach bag, like a young swimsuit-wielding model would have taken a young boy.
The dark orange Rafia bag, trimmed by Rafia Jhalar and with a white leather handle on top, was the best piece in the Jacquemeaz La Rivière SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Renowned stylist Luke Armitage told Fimmel: 'I was expecting big hats and beach bags to hit the mainstream for next summer. The designer made such an impression that it would be hard to ignore the demand for this oversized device.'
J. Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens.
Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018, with another set of unusual test results being added, which are credited solely to individual and collective achievements in sports, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which strives to deliver the highest standards of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as a global citizen.
As a field of study that can design and implement a pre-determined school curriculum, we are looking at modern languages as a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language they understand, it goes straight to their head.
If you speak to someone in a language they understand, it goes straight to their heart.
It is very important to remember that we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the recent examination this year, we can see that the language league tables are top ranking with the highest pass rates among the independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students in Mandarin achieved a high grade A, while the number of German learners was 72%, the number of French learners was 69% and the number of Spanish learners achieving an A grade was 63%.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an important skill, which will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Language as a subject of choice is now being considered in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that lack of language skills was responsible for 17% of the reasons given by employers to fill vacancies.
Language skills are becoming increasingly essential for preparing the youth for their future careers.
These skills have become essential in a globalised world, with more potential job opportunities requiring language.
Regardless of the career they choose, if they learn a second language, they can have a real benefit in the future because they have life-long skills like this.
With the ability to communicate directly with people abroad, the multilingual person will automatically be placed at the forefront of the competition.
According to a 2013 UGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language in a communicative manner, and only 15% of those who spoke French were able to do so in the double digits.
This is why investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
Multilingualism, especially in developing economies, will create better opportunities for children to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school teaches a different language.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK as we look ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what your child is interested in, independent schools have a wide range of languages to choose from, and a class of teachers with expertise in the relevant fields.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that will prepare students and equip them with the skills to succeed, no matter what the future may hold.
At this time, in a global business environment, there is no denying that language is very important for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be thought of as "international communication skills".
Independent Schools will continue to offer choice, diversity and excellence to the youth of Scotland.
Il fait le fair. I was born in Paris.
John Edward is a director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is making his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans' wait to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in Sunday's preseason opener in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play is yet to be decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play limited minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need a pre-season game to prepare", he said.
Trump's rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump kicked off a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This was the first of five scheduled rallies by Trump over the next week, including stops at his favorite locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By blocking a confirmation vote for his election to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans fear losing control of Congress when the vote comes in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 PM ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live stream online on YouTube.
Trump may address this week's hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, whose case has been strained by sexual misconduct allegations that have held up an expected Senate confirmation vote for a week for an FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these rallies is to help the Republicans get some momentum going into the November elections.
Thus, the Trump campaign has said that the purpose of these five rallies this coming week is to spark a buzz among volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to preserve and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, Reuters said.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that as we move forward in this busy campaign season, the president will travel to as many states as possible", Trump's campaign spokesman told Reuters, without revealing his name.
The West Virginia Metro News opined that tonight's rally, scheduled for the Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling, could bring in a large number of supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh media.
Saturday's visit will be the second in a month to West Virginia, a state from which he won by more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president is coming to help him in this election", said Simon Heder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showed determination to keep it alive as they headed into Sunday singles.
After three one-off sessions, the Saturday afternoon quartet gave the Ryder Cup its desired performance.
The hallucinatory sensory oscillator is a concept invented entirely in sports, but it's something that athletes must absolutely believe in, and never more so than competition.
So they're going to say, "Where's the momentum now?"
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we're getting a little bit of momentum now", said Jordan Spith as he left at the end of the day.
Europe is in a good position, of course, four points ahead and 12 more to play.
The Americans feel, says Spith, that even though there's little wind in the way of their balls, they have a lot to cheer on, not just because of the form of Spith and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
From T to Green, Spieth has been aggressive and his leadership exemplary.
The celebration was already going on as he started his round, and when he and Thomas were two behind two, they took the big put and took all four squares.
The screams from his punches, responsible for winning the game at 15, would have made you believe that he still believed the Americans were in the race.
"You really have to try harder and worry about your own game", said Spith.
It's about what each of these players left behind.
There are 18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, with the controversial Ryder Cup stories.
The European paradox, but the attractive pair won four out of four and there was nothing wrong with it.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who couldn't shoot a bogie on a Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogie on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and backed up at 9am on Friday.
The run, and the excitement that flowed from the roaring crowd, made it seem that those players were the losers on Sunday, and as the sun began to set on Le Golf National, there were no other popular players to secure a potential European victory than Fleetwood and Molinari.
Two on different holes at the same time is more appropriate.
Nevertheless, the story of European prestige was premature.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson cut short the work of Sergio Garcia, the morning Forbowl hero, when he paired with Alex Noreen.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine doubles, the Spaniard and the Swede never got close to a hole.
On Sunday, though, there was no one in your hall to help you.
The reason why the Forboles and Forums were so attractive to look at closely was because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they gave and the advice they didn't give, and the way in which a strategy could change in a moment.
Europe as a team has played well, so they had a significant lead on the final day, but even in this Forums session Team USA showed a fighting attitude, especially on the Stateside, where there was doubt.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a strong advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead over the United States after coming out of Saturday's Fourbowl and Foursomes matches.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the match with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods and lifted their lead at Le Golf National to four points.
Having lost at Hazeltine two years earlier, Thomas Jorn's European team won the series 3-1 over the USA, who had played poorly in the morning's Four Bowls in an attempt to retain the trophy.
In the Forums, Europe resisted more and won the games, but they could not make up the damage.
Jim Ferkey's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European player to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, dubbed "Mollywood", were the only pair in Ryder Cup history to score all points from their first four matches after a thrilling weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-bowl, they even more vigorously outplayed the dispirited Woods and Bryson Dashby of the United States by 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled himself back from two games on Saturday, would occasionally show a hint of brilliance, but of his 29 games in the Fourbowl and Foursome, he was now down 19 and down seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning's Four Bowls, returned to the Forums with partner Henrik Stenson and defeated world ranked Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who were 1 and 3, 2 and 1.
On a sunny, windy day in the southwest of Paris, nothing happened to Europe to make it fit.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
He won the Fourboys by defeating Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter in a 2-1 tie and then came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 after missing the opening two holes in the Fourboys.
Although only one draw was needed to keep the record of the previous champion Furich, it has happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has come back from a four-point deficit going into singles.
After two days of second-best, however, Sunday's counterattack seemed as if it was beyond their power.
North Korea refuses to unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are eroding trust in the United States and that in such a situation the country will not unilaterally give up nuclear weapons by any means.
Re Yong Hoen told the World Organization's annual general meeting that North Korea had taken "remarkable goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying nuclear test sites, and pledging not to expand nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not received any relevant response from the US", he said.
Without any confidence in the US, we will not have confidence in our national security and in such a situation we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
While Reini reiterated North Korea's usual complaints about Washington's resistance to the phase-out steps, under which North Korea would be rewarded for taking softer steps, his statement is noteworthy at a time when Pyongyang had not previously refused to unilaterally halt denuclearization.
Reini referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever meeting between the acting US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim pledged to work towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump assured North Korea of its security.
North Korea 1950-53 North Korea is demanding a formal end to the Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls for the lifting of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US is insisting on denuclearization first and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals by force, and even objecting to declaring an end to the war, Re said.
The idea that the ban will bring us to our knees is a commonplace idea among those who are not familiar with us .
But the problem is that the constant restrictions are destroying our trust.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which was mentioned by U.S. leaders at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, saying: "If South Korea had been a party to the issue of denuclearization and not the US, then the Korean Peninsula denuclearization dilemma would not have arisen".
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he addressed the UN General Assembly about the inevitability of targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korean rockets, when Trump called Kim a suicide-minded rocket man.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courageous steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should continue until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying, "It doesn't matter if it took two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia argued at the UN that Pyongyang should be rewarded for its actions by the Security Council.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and decisively until the complete, final and verifiable denuclearization is achieved".
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to block its funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and explosive missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside and told the UN General Assembly that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last visit was not good.
In July, they left Pyongyang saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea, to announce it in a few hours, making demands like "bullshit".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised that if the United States took appropriate action, it would destroy the missile site and, as well, the nuclear complex.
He said Kim told him that the "relevant measures" he wanted would be the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a rest-taking course.
To counter the growing masculinity culture of staying up all night drinking caffeine, Harvard University is introducing a new sleeping more course for all its undergraduates this year.
One educator found that when they went to one of the top universities in the world, they were often ignorant of the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chizler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has designed a course that is believed to be the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start this course by giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And at the end of the year, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I being told this now, when I'm in my final year?"
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", she told The Telegraph.
This course, which is being presented for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits are essential for students and athletes to improve their performance and overall health.
Paul Barriera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to launch the course after a week of students being severely sleep deprived.
This one-hour course consists of a series of interactive objectives.
One area has a picture of a dorm room, where students are having coffee, and there are curtains, tutors, and books about the effects of caffeine and light, and how lack of sleep affects athlete performance, and the importance of sleep timing.
In the second part, participants were told how prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then inspires the participants to think about their routine.
We know that this will not change student behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know -- just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes", Professor Chizler added.
The pride culture of staying up all night, he said, combined with the influx of modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students, meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring good quality, adequate sleep should be a secret weapon for students to overcome stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and also to prevent weight gain, because if the brain is deprived of sleep, it stays hungry and keeps them hungry.
Professor Chizler, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology, helped design the course, which he took as a first year student at Harvard last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a campus-wide curriculum.
He hopes that in the next phase, all postgraduate students will be told that they should complete a course like this before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Chizler recommends that students set alarms for when to go to bed and when to get up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your body clock rhythms, causing sleep problems.
Livingstone 1  0 Rangers: Menga's goal towered over Gerard's team
The Rangers suffered another setback, when Dolly Menga's strike defeated Steven Gerrard's disrupted team at Livingstone 1-0.
The Iberbrooks were looking for their first win on their way since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side only saw Gerard lose his second of 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership-leading Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and never saw a team of under-motivated Rangers trying to tie the game.
With Rangers now pushed to sixth, Livingstone are in third place, just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And it could be an even bigger problem for the Rangers, because the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury caused by an object being thrown from the other end.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which surpassed the changes made by Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same Livy 11 who had scored a point against Hearts last week and must have been very pleased with the way he had been stumbling his opponents with his fine moves at every turn.
Although the Rangers had more possession, Livingston made more use of the ball they had.
He could have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first-half lay-off sent Scott Pittman into Ann McGregor's goal, but the midfielder snatched his big opportunity.
Keegan Jacobs on the deep sent a free kick to captain Craig Holcutt but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, came in on the back post.
Rangers took the lead but their performance in the last third showed a lack of confidence.
Alfredo Morelos was adamant that he should have been awarded a penalty at the quarter-hour mark because of his clash with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers were able to hit only two first-half shots on target but ex-Ibrocks goalkeeper Liam Kelly, Lasana Colibelli's header and Avi Izaria's breathless strikes were not difficult to block.
Livi's first goal in the 34th minute was against the flow of the game, but it was hard work and no one will be able to deny it.
The Rangers once again failed to match Jacobs' set-piece on the Deep.
When Declan Gollger handed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Orfield made no response, who quietly chose the lamb for easy completion.
Gerard showed efficiency by calling Colibelly to replace Ryan Kent at the break and the change had immediate effects, with Morelos on the winger passing but the formidable playmaker Kelly coming off his line to block.
But, with Lithgow and Holcett hitting one long ball after another, Livingston continued to force the guests to play their favorite way.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the final stage, but McGregor stood firm to stop Jacobs until Lithgow came from the far corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton made a late second claim for a penalty on the stroke he hit Jacobs but Thompson again did not pay attention.
Almanac: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: 136 years ago today, on September 30, 1882, and beyond... on this day in Germany, the future physicist Jonas William "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, which led to the invention of the Geiger counter.
Since then, the mainstream of science, the Geiger counter, has also become mainstream pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans playing scientists who appear to be cowboys:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive alkali like uranium.
When you put these on, you can actually hear the sound of the atomic blasts coming out of the alkali radiation".
Evans: "You could say they're popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days short of his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bore his name was immortalised.
A new cancer vaccine will teach the immune system to 'see' malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine will teach the immune system to 'see' and kill malignant cells
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
This is a technique that takes immune cells from patients and transforms them in the lab.
They can then see the proteins that are common in many cancers and then they are re-injected into the body.
The trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize malignant cells, and her ovarian cancer was shown to disappear for more than 18 months.
In this method, immune cells are removed from patients and transformed in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein called HER2, common in many cancers, and then re-injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzowski of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "is involved in the development of a number of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explains Professor Berzowski.
Similarly, an approach to harvesting immune cells from patients and "training" them to attack cancer cells is useful in a type of blood cancer.
Kenny West, wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL, was a bitter critic of Trump.
They didn't like it.
After a stunning performance by Kenny West in which he praised US President Donald Trump and urged him to run in 2020, people blew up his studio during Saturday Night Live.
After the third song, which he sang on the night of his "Ghost Town" in which he wore a Make America Great cap, he became angry with the Democrats and once again declared his support for Trump.
"I talked to a white man a few times and he said, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
So, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL kicked off the show with a skit starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star blew the lid off Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Though it was not aired, footage of West's rant was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock's post was an attempt to mock the West.
Also, West complained to the audience that he was suffering from backstage pain due to his hat on his head.
"They were cheering me on behind the stage.
He said, 'Don't go on stage with that hat on.'
They flattered me!
And then he said I was drowning", he said, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Have you seen the sinkhole?" So he said, "I'll wear my Superman cap, because you can't tell me what it means to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love".
His comments were echoed by the audience at least twice, and SNL's cast members seemed to be in shock, many said, one of whom told the publication: "Death-like silence spread throughout the studio".
West was brought in to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West was a huge success with his song "I Love It" as Perrier Bottle.
West was backed by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For the most adventurous vibe: Thank you for standing up for the crowd".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "as it is, and it's absolutely amazing".
"But I will not reward anyone who is conducting or spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art").
He is free.
And we are free", she continued.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "officially known as Kenny West".
He wasn't the first artist to change his name, he followed Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Daddy.
Co-rapper Snoop Dogg was formerly known as Snoop Lion and of course the former music emperor Prince, who changed his name to Prince and the artist was formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder in Belfast restaurant case
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackmore.
The defendant is expected to appear before Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed through the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington has attacked toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is best known for his role as swordsman John Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor criticized the stereotyping of the male hero, saying that such roles on screen make young boys feel like they often have to be racist to get respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something is wrong" and raised the question of how to deal with toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admits he has a 'very strong' desire to solve the problem.
'I feel very strongly personally at this point - what's wrong with our masculinity?' he said.
'What are we teaching people about the problems we're seeing as they grow up?'
Kit believes that the increasingly masculine television characters are partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity.
They add: 'What is inborn and what is taught?
Because of what is taught on TV and on the streets, do young boys think they have to have these specific qualities to be men?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because something is definitely wrong with the young children.'
In an interview, he admitted that he will not be making a prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after it ends next summer, and that he is 'bored with the arena and the horses'.
Starting in November, Kit will be working on the remake of Sam Shepherd's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his thieving brother.
The actor recently revealed that the best outcome of Game of Thrones was the gift of his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on the show and in that sense he gave me my future family and life after that,' he said.
Rose played Grit, the girlfriend of John Snow, the character Kit, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married on the grounds of the family estate in Lesley, Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China has seen a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in its population with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials said that more than 8,20,000 people in the country are infected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, nearly 40,000 new cases were reported.
The majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, reflecting changes in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spread rapidly in some parts of China by contaminated blood donations.
But the number of people infected with HIV has dropped sharply to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 1,00,000 each year.
HIV transmission through sex is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has increased.
The study findings suggest that due to the country's conservative values, an estimated 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
The lack of protection in such relationships is responsible for most of the disease transmission.
Since 2003, as part of efforts to tackle the problem, the Chinese government has promised universal availability of HIV drugs.
Maxine Waters denied that the employee had breached GOP Senator's data, calling it 'dangerous fraud' and 'conspiracy theory'.
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that one of her staffers posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislature.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the claims were backed by "right-wing pundits" and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more hateful lies", Waters said in a statement on his Twitter account.
The leaked information allegedly included the residential addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information posted by an unnamed Isma on Capitol Hill during the Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh appeared online on Thursday.
It was leaked after the three senators had examined Kawanuu.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pandit and RedStat reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was associated with Waters' office and that one of Waters' employees displayed the information, The Hill reported.
"These baseless allegations are completely false and basically false", Waters continued.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations - is not responsible for the breach of this information in any way.
These baseless allegations are completely false and basically false".
Waters's statement immediately sparked online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"It is an outrage to deny", writes Fleischer.
"It shows that her temperament is not worthy of being a Congresswoman.
It is not right to be angry when someone is accused of something he did not do.
They should not be distracted.
They don't want to question the motives of the accuser.
They need to be calm and happy".
Fleischer Waters' reaction was seen as a counterpoint to the comments made by Democrats against Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being very angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
"A really big deal", he tweeted.
In her statement Waters said her office had "notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims".
"We will ensure that the criminals are exposed", she added, "and that they are held legally accountable for their destructive actions and for any and all acts that endanger any or all of my staff".
John English Strikes Again review - a spy parody of the less effective Rowan Atkinson
It's now a tradition for any new film to feature the effects of Brexit in British art, and this is also true of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise - which began in 2003 as Johnny English and was revived in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
Will there be a cheerful self-deprecation about how worthless we are as the country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the inefficient Johnny English of the rubber-faced is renewing his license to cook things for the second time - his name indicates that he has a huge comic creation design for non-English film audiences.
He's definitely a dumb secret agent who, despite the bizarre hype of lazy glamour, looks a little bit like Mr. Bean, and the guy's thug contributes a note to the tune of the Charities of Fire theme at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
The character, based on the traveller and mystery international man who once played a part in Atkinson's now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, adds to his confusion.
There are also a couple of great moments in this latest JE movie.
I loved the scene where John English walks up to the helicopter in his medieval armor and the wings of the fan hit his head with a bell.
The gift of physical humor that Atkins has received appears to be, but, humor seems very little effective and oddly unnecessary in the face of "serious" film brands, especially 007 and Mission Impossible, which now faithfully incorporate humor as an element.
The comedy seems to be designed for children, not adults, and I found Johnny English's freaky accident to be less inventive and focused than Atkinson's Bean-shaped silent-film comedies.
Now the general premise of the matter is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker breaks into the super-secret web network of Britain's intelligence services and reveals the identities of all the UK's working agents, leaving the working agent in shock - a very small role for Kevin Alden.
The last hope for the fierce and quarrelsome and already declining political leader is that Emma Thompson has played a great role as Theresa May, but she has little room for more in the story.
Her intelligence advisors tell her that with every active intelligence leak, she'll have to bring in someone who's retired.
And that means that the idiot Johnny English, who is currently working as a school teacher in a luxury colony, giving extracurricular lessons on how to become an intelligence operative: here are some great funny moments, because he turns the English school into a rock-type spy academy.
English is suddenly called back to White Hall for an emergency briefing and is again reunited with his long-time colleague, Bo, played by Bell Miller.
Bo is now married, he's married to a submarine commander, a jolie-hockey-sticks role that has squandered the potential of an artist like Vicky Pepperdine.
Batman and Robin, who make terrible mistakes, come to the Secret Service of each Magistrate, facing the beautiful and deadly woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ofelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the formidable Jason Volta played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo embark on their ridiculously fun journey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a glitzy French restaurant; they mess up while smuggling themselves out of Volta's luxury yacht; and English messes up by trying to put on a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
The episodes are all pulled together for the final episode, but as fun and violent as they are, they seem like a children's TV show.
It's a lot of stuff.
And like all the other Johnny English films, I wondered: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a starring role for his talent?
The Labour Party denied that the British were planning a four-day work week and a five-day paycheck.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan for the British to work four days a week and receive a five-day salary.
The party allegedly wants the money saved by the company owners from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to be repaid by giving employees an extra day off.
This will give employees three days off but no reduction in salary.
According to sources, this idea is 'flexible' in the party's economic agenda and policies to bend the country to the interests of the workers.
The Trade Union Congress has praised the four-day week as a way for employees to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A change in policy is expected to be announced by the end of this year.
'This will not happen overnight but the four-day work week is an aspiration that is in line with the party's vision of restructuring the economy in the interests of the workers as well as the party's overall industrial policy.'
The Labour Party was not the first to promote such an idea, the Green Party had promised a four-day work week in their 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not fully rewarded by the present Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not the party's policy, it has not been the party's idea.'
Former Finance Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to explain his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy in more detail.
Mr. McDonnell said he was adamant about taking power away from the 'faceless directors' of service industries and the 'non-profits' of utilities.
The scheme of the Finance Minister also means that the existing investors in water utilities cannot get back their full share of their investment because the labour government can 'deprive' them based on the irregularities found there.
He also reiterated plans to include employees on the company's boards of directors, as well as to create an inclusive equity fund to fund employees eligible for up to £500 annual dividend of 10% of the shares of private sector entities.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tell "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh has changed their views
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week, and the Bureau's findings raise questions about whether any Republican party member could be hesitant about withdrawing his support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI had found anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy spoke more openly than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Yes, of course", Kennedy said.
"I went to the hearing and spoke to Justice Kavanaugh.
All of this happened, the allegation came out, and then I called them and said, "Why did you do this?"
He was tenacious, firm and unquestioning".
Graham's opinion, however, seemed to be fixed.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and only a major accusation can change it", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has denied the charge with all his might", Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And not everyone she named could confirm it.
This is 36 years old.
I don't think it's going to change anything".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and have they done anything to eradicate poverty?
The annual Global Citizen Festival is taking place in New York on Saturday, with some of the biggest stars in the world taking part, and the goal is just as big: eradicating global poverty.
In this seventh year of the Global Citizen Festival, tens of millions of people will gather on the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the art of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to spread the true purpose of the event, which is to end abject poverty in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people working to eradicate poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), the audience of the event had to perform a series of tasks or "acts" such as volunteering to spread their global eradication agenda, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise engaging in any meaningful means.
But with 12 years to go, how successful has Global Citizen been?
Is the idea of having a free music event for the public an honest way to get people to take action or just another form of so-called "clictivicism" - where people think that signing an online petition or tweeting makes a real difference?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, its supporters have reportedly made more than 19 million "creations" for various purposes.
He says his actions have helped to persuade world leaders to announce pledges and policies of $3.7 trillion or more, which will impact over 225 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group demonstrated 390 pledges and announcements resulting from its work, of which at least USD 1 trillion has already been distributed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds made available have directly impacted the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key promises include Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and organizers in the U.K. that "helps young children thrive to their full potential", who, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world, have pledged $35 million in funding to the country to end malnutrition in Rwanda.
With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history", said Tracy Ullman, a Power of Nutrition Goodwill Ambassador, to the audience at a music event in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking over 5000 actions to improve maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 50 lakh women and children with nutrition assistance.
In answering one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "It's going to be a long and difficult road - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, like our previous civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because together we have become stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monet are among the artists performing at this year's New York show, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US Navy could use "blockade" to block Russian energy exports: Interim Secretary
US Secretary of State Ryan Zinck made clear that Washington would use the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from reaching other markets, including the Middle East, the Washington Examiner said.
Zink has alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where Russia is acting at the invitation of its legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"The reason they're in the Middle East is because I think they want to broker energy like Eastern Europe, like the southern part of Europe", Zink is reported to have said.
And according to the authorities, these are the ways and means to deal with it.
He said, "The United States Navy has the ability to ensure that the sea lanes remain open to ensure that their energy does not reach the market, and also to jam if necessary.
Zinc was speaking at an event organized by the nonprofit Consumers Energy Alliance, which calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's positions on Russia and Iran deals and noted that they are effectively identical.
"The cheapest option is to profit from fuels and use alternative fuels, which is less and less likely to be the case for Iran and Russia", he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony", and adding that Russia's economy is dependent on biofuels.
The comments come as the Trump administration seeks to replace Russia as a cheaper alternative to European consumers by increasing its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe.
Accordingly, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has "taken over" Berlin from Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $1100 million Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 11000 cubic meters, is a fully affordable project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we have a shared view that energy cannot be a means of creating pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US initiative has received strong support from Germany and Germany has expressed its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), the leading body for industry in Germany, has called on the US to withdraw from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements in Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big issue for me when our energy supply is interfered with by a third country", said Dieter Kemf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "pay very close attention" to the 2020 presidential election, said the Massachusetts lawmaker.
Massachusetts Rep. Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she will "carefully consider" the upcoming presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a speech at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren reiterated that he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes the act of a woman taking the top job", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will pay close attention to the presidential election".
Warren argued with Trump during the town hall, saying President Donald Trump was "leading this county in the wrong direction".
She said, "I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy".
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We definitely need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday found that a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think he should run for president in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, ninety-eight percent of "potential" Massachusetts voters said Warren should not run.
Thirty-two percent of the people voted in favour of such an election.
The poll showed that former Governor Deval Patrick had a 38 percent support and 48 percent opposition to the possible election.
Other key Democratic names in the discussion in the context of the possible 2020 election included Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont House of Representatives Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin gave an example of PTSD by Track Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump.
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"Seeing what my stepson is going through, what he is going through and coming back from, I can give some insight to other families who are facing the unintended consequences of PTSD and to the wounded soldiers who are coming back", he told the audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room", and he said of his son and other veterans, "They come back a little different, they come back tough, they come back wondering if the respect that their fellow soldiers and every member of the Air Force and the Army has for the country is there".
According to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday and charged with domestic violence against a woman by interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while intoxicated.
18 States, D.C. support the challenge of the new Asra policy.
The legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of denying care to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence has been supported by 18 states and the District of Columbia.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a friend-of-the-court brief in Washington on Friday in support of a asylum seeker who opposed the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sears, a class action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and the children of his violent gang members" abused her but U.S. officials denied her request for a shelter facility on July 20.
She was being held in Texas.
Lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that face problems with gangs and domestic violence, with large numbers of U.S. asylum applicants.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Carl Racine, the Attorney General for the District of Columbia, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"All claims for dependency under federal law must be adjudicated according to the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such prohibition constitutes a violation of that rule", the Friend-of-the-Court brief said.
In the brief, advocates further argued that denial of immigration harms the U.S. economy, saying that immigrants are more likely to become professionals and "provide essential labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer allow victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence into the compound.
"Asylum is available to people who leave their homeland due to fear or persecution because of their religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political ideology", Sessions said in a statement on the policy on June 11.
All the problems that people around the world face every day -- even the most serious ones -- were never meant to be solved in one place.
The search for survivors has doubled the number of deaths, and efforts to rescue victims are still ongoing.
The situation for life was becoming more and more dire.
"It's very stressful", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who was crying over her fever-stricken son in the burned-out city of Palu.
"An ambulance comes every minute with a body.
It's a lack of clean water".
I could see residents picking up their flooded belongings, trying to save whatever they could find, going back to their destroyed homes.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overwhelmed by the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Some of the wounded, including a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside due to the constant intense backlash.
His eyes filled with memories of the tremor that shook the fifth floor of the hotel where he lived with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save myself.
I think I was pressed under the mud pillar of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had gone to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then she calmed down.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of 'peddling' with 'election ads'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily that described the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China denounced the use of the American press to spread propaganda in Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused China of rigging the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, which China denied, citing a paid supply of the Chinese newspaper in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's most widely circulated newspaper.
Trump's accusation that China tried to rig the US election is a new chapter in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China, as US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war, resulting in them imposing tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts say China's response tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to sway exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, a longtime governor of Iowa, a major agricultural exporter to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad writes, "China is now doubling down on the hype in our own free press by offering propaganda ads".
"The Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by running paid ads in Des Moines to spread its propaganda", writes Branstad.
"In contrast, the newspapers for sale on Beijing's streets are lacking in contrarian tone and do not truly reflect the differing opinions of the Chinese people on China's troubled economic projection, as the media are tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he writes.
He added that "a major Chinese newspaper turned down an offer to publish his article", without naming the newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans are polarizing women voters with Kavanaugh's defeat before the midterm.
With several top Republicans standing up and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of multiple sexual assaults, analysts warn that they will be hit especially hard by women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment is very strong and the majority of Republicans are officially showing that they will vote on it.
Those things cannot be turned back", Grant Reher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell College, said in an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Rehr said there was doubt as to whether the proposal put forward by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) at the time of the bill for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it in November", said Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MovOn, on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee supported Kavanaugh's nomination even after the testimony of Dr. Christine Blassy Ford, protesters in the Senate hallway chanted "November is coming!"
"The Democrats' enthusiasm and inspiration is flowing", Stu Roddenberg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already at the top; it's true.
But it can grow even further, especially for volatile female voters in the suburbs, as well as younger voters aged 18 to 29, who don't usually vote when they don't like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had suggested that if Republicans agreed with confirmation, they could be slammed.
"It's kind of a mess for the GOP now", former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier last week, NBC News reported.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it's also about how the Republicans handled the case and how they treated her", Gay Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group that helped elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, in the context of the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, Americans are seen to be divided about whom to trust, with Kavanaugh's slightly more inclined.
While 41 percent of respondents in a new poll by Yugow definitely or potentially believe Ford's testimony, 35 percent said they definitely or potentially believe Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent said that while Kavanaugh definitely or potentially lied during the testimony, only 30 percent said so in the case of Ford.
Following Flake's request, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 17 when Kavanaugh assaulted him while intoxicated.
Ramirez alleged that while attending Yale in the 1980s, a Supreme Court nominee revealed his gender to him at a party.
The founders of the World Wide Web are planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The well-known technician's latest project, 'Inerpt', is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform 'Solid'.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which information to give access to which people.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee stated that the goal behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
"We have to do this now", he said of the start-up.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
These can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and business tools.
This means Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in the same browser at the same time.
The unique feature of online personal data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to decide what kind of information to handle.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
According to CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to bring the right resources, processes and skills to the company to provide solid solutions for everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired from IBM, a staff of a few developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrept website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team "are not talking about whether or not to make a complete change to Facebook and Google, which will cause all their business models to completely collapse overnight.
"We do not ask their permission".
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that Inerpt's "mission is to provide commercial power and ecosystems to help maintain the integrity and quality of the new web built on solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even as he launches Inerpt, Berners-Lee will remain as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of the Web", Berners-Lee added in the book.
Bernard Vaughan: World War I Victoria Cross cleric is celebrated
Its groundbreaking celebration was held 100 years later in honour of the only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross as a war hero in World War I.
Lt. Col. The Reverend Bernard Vaughan won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the raids at Bellinglis and Lehcourt.
However, four days later he was shot dead by a hostage-taking soldier in hiding, never knowing that he had received the highest honour of the British Army.
At a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday, two of his grandchildren unveiled a chandelier in his memory.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vaughn, said that the unveiling of the chatuti, 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat, was "very symbolic.
On 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in the midst of the most dense fog and heavy fire and machine gun fire from the battlefield", according to the London Gazette.
He then moved to the firing line and carried the line forward "extremely bravely" before losing three detachments, facing the cannons on the battlefield alone.
Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - about a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said that his grandfather's work was "a kind of homage that I could never do".
He and his brother Dr. James Vaughan also presented a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughn said he felt "very honoured to be part of the parade" and added that "the support from the crowd was a demonstration of the bravery of a true hero".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Blatter 206, but instead they watched Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you stay up all night to watch a full-on Blatter 206 but you're denied the main program.
The San Jose Beals featured 13 matches, including six on the main card, and were scheduled to be broadcast live overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, as Gerard Moosey and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, instead of showing his coverage, he shocked viewers in the UK by broadcasting Peppa Pig.
Especially some of those who stayed up until dawn for that fight were disappointed.
One fan tweeted about the cartoon being "a kind of cruel joke".
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bealtor, said, "They had to put on a children's program because the content was not aired at 6 a.m. as per government regulations".
"Peppa the Pig, yes".
Scott Coker, chairman of the Bealtor Company, said they would be rethinking their schedule to accommodate UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I thought of replay, it seemed like a possibility that we could do this", Cocker said.
"But it was six o'clock there on a Sunday morning, and we couldn't do it until our Sunday, which was their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, there were a lot of messages coming and going after they changed, and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government matter.
I can promise that this will not happen again.
We're going to have five fights instead of the usual six -- and we tried to give the fans more, but we failed.
It was an unfortunate situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly feels 'nowhere' from sex
Olympic diver Tom Daly says his sexuality made him feel inferior - but it inspired him to succeed.
I didn't realize until I was in high school that "not everyone is like me", said 24-year-old Daly.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren LaVerne, he said he spoke about gay rights to provide "hope" to others.
He also said that being a parent has reduced his appreciation for winning the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular presenter, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
In his first appearance as an outcast on LaVerne, Daley said that he grew up feeling "less" than everyone else, because "liking boys and girls was not accepted by society".
He said: "To this day, the feeling of being inferior and of being different has been the key to my strength and strength to succeed".
He said he wanted to show them that I was somebody, so that when people actually found out about their sexuality, they wouldn't disappoint them.
A two-time Olympic bronze medallist, Daly became a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used her presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries not to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky enough to be able to live freely without fear of being judged for his actions, and he wanted to show others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with the man - whom she met in 2013, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black - "was amazing".
Daly married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year, but said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you've been through so much at such a young age" - he first competed in the Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer just three years later - he said it's hard to find someone at this age who has seen so many ups and downs.
The couple became parents of Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said that their "entire approach" changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have said 'I want to win gold,'" he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal".
He named his son Robert after his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daly said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and one of the last things he did was ask if he had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"'I didn't have the courage to tell them you couldn't sit in the front row, Dad,' he said.
"I was holding his hand when he took his last breath, and I wasn't sure he was invincible until his breath really stopped and he died", he said.
The following year, Deli competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew that there could be no higher feeling than what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of home spectators at the Olympic Games", he said.
He was also inspired to choose his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which matches him in the preparation for the Olympics and still stands his fork on his arm.

Michaelson, who was out of form, was added as an extra for the Ryder Cup.
Phil Michaelson of the United States will set a new record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid a painful milestone.
Michaelson, playing in the biennial event for the 12th time in a row, is being recruited by captain Jim Furyk as an extra for Saturday's Fourballs and Foursomes.
Instead of getting involved in the actual game, as he always does for the United States, this five-time major winner divided his day to focus on the game in the range in hopes of encouraging and eliminating the factors that were causing his game to falter.
Even though he was never the most straightforward driver at the peak of his career, 48-year-old Michaelson is not ideal for the disciplined Lee Golf National Course, where the long, steep sections never forgive a wrong shot.
And if the course itself isn't as challenging, Michaelson will face the exact British Open winner, Francesco Molinari, in Sunday's ninth match, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans start 12 singles matches four points behind, in the absence of a good start, Michaelson's match could be very important.
Furik showed confidence in his player, except that he could not say more.
"He fully understood his role today, he patted me on the back and put his hand around my neck and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furik said.
"He has gained a lot of confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's given these teams a lot before and this week.
I probably never imagined he would play two games.
I had imagined more, but this is what I decided to do, and this is the way I think we should go.
He wants to be there, like everybody else".
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This may be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which will never match the height of his personal records.
Michaelson won 18, lost 20 and drew seven matches, Furyk said his presence added an intangible value to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's witty and he likes to make people laugh and he's the best guy to be with the team", he explained.
"The young players will have fun with him, as well as this week, which they will love to see.
He's not just playing, he's giving more than that".
European captain Thomas Bourne knows that the big league may soon be gone
European captain, Thomas Bourne, knows from his experience that a good lead before the final day's Ryder Cup singles could easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut in a match at Valderrama in 1997, when the team led by Seve Ballesteror had a five-point lead over the Americans but when the match ended, they were outmatched and won by only 141⁄2-131⁄2 short of the lowest margin.
"You stay up to date by reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brooklyn, where we lost, and we won at Valderrama, but only by a small margin", Bourne said as he watched a class of 5-3 wins both Friday and yesterday in 2018 that led to a 10-6 lead at Lee Golf National.
History will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You'll have to tear it down tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It doesn't end until you score on the board.
Our goal is to win this trophy and that is what we will be focused on.
I've said all the things, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're aware of who's on the other side of us - the greatest players in the world".
Pleased with his players' performance on the difficult golf course, Bourne adds: "I can never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow's challenge is different.
Tomorrow there's a solo exhibition, and doing that is a different story.
It's great to play with a partner when things are going well, but when you go out there alone, it puts your skills as a golfer to the test.
This is the message you have to give to the players that you should do your best tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner behind and he wants to do his best, too".
Unlike Bourne, Furyk from the opposing team would focus on his players' individual performances better than their paired performances, with the exception of Rondon Speith and Justin Thomas who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself toured Europe with the "Madina Miracle", before that defeat, as part of the winning team on both sides of those big final-day turnarounds.
In 1999, when Captain Crenshaw asked his players how they got through the final day, he replied, "I remember every word of it".
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you have to start fast, as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that speed is going in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We'll set up our line-up accordingly and put our players in the game as if we're going to do magic tomorrow".
To try to fightback, Thomas was sent forward on performance and he was to face Rory McIlroy in the top match, followed by Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Raham, Tommy Fleetwood in the top half of the other Europeans.
"I put these players in this order because I thought they would cover all sides", Bourne said of his single picks.
The new German battleship was pushed back once again.
The latest battleship of the German Navy was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era battleships, but due to poor systems and rising prices, it will not arrive until at least next year, local media reported.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesperson, the commissioning of the Baden-Württemberg-class battleship, the Rhyland-Fage, has now been postponed to the first six months of 2019.
The ship was to be commissioned in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was delayed due to worrisome post-delivery issues.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class battleships.
It is understood that it will include a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft squadron and anti-ship missile, as well as some covert technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include long maintenance life - the latest warships should be able to be deployed away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the continuing delays mean that modern warships - allowing Germany to demonstrate its strength at sea - will be obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit reported.
The ill-fated F125 battle-hardened became a topic of discussion last year, when German naval officials refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Lom & Foss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but German media reported several significant "software and hardware flaws" that made the battleship unsuitable for deployment on combat missions.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ship would be operated by 120 sailors - half the manpower of the older Bremen-class battleships.
Also, it was found that the ship is too heavy which would reduce its performance and the Navy would not be able to upgrade it in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Royland-Phage" is thought to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
As well as defective hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also a problem.
It has gone from the initial €2.2 billion to the staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problems of the latest combat missions are of particular importance in the light of the warning that the German Navy is in decline.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was indeed "running out of deployable ships".
The official said that the problem is growing rapidly as time passes as the old boats are decommissioned, but they are not replaced by new ones.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class battleships are fit for service.
The National Trust has been stealing information about the secret life of the tiger.
New research in the Scottish Highlands has revealed how bats use terrain to search for food.
It is hoped that the new discovery will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study by National Trust of Scotland researchers will follow the trail of common and soprano pipistrels as well as brown long-eared and dobbenton bats at Invererve Gardens in West Ross.
Special sound recorders will be placed at strategic locations on the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
All sound recording experts will analyze the frequency of the call of the bats and determine what species are doing.
A natural habitat map and report will be prepared later to create a comprehensive landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
NTS conservation adviser, Rob Dever, hopes the results will reveal which areas of natural habitat are important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help in determining the benefits of natural habitat management activities such as creation of nesting grounds and how to better maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
The number of tigers in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by habitat loss and natural habitat loss due to construction and development works.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do flypapers and certain chemical processes in building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, their night-time hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes for catching prey.
They use advanced eco-location techniques to detect insects and obstacles in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, has taken the batwagon very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspect the shelters and sometimes even carry out rescue operations.
The Institute has set up Scotland's first and only wild turtle reserve at Thrive Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten species.
David Thompson, the manager of the estate, said that the estate is an ideal territory for him.
"Threeve is a great area for bats", he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good natural habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us understand more about what's needed for their success".
They stress the need to inspect bats before maintaining property as it could involuntarily destroy a single-motherhood home, leading to the deaths of 400 females and infants, and risking the local population being wiped out altogether.
Bats are protected and it is a crime to kill, torture or harm them or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Farrell, Scottish officer of the Batwagul Conservation Trust, encouraged people to help.
They said, "We have a lot to learn about our bats because we don't know what the population status of many of our species is".
Ronaldo denies rape charges and lawyers are preparing to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has denounced the rape allegations against him as "fake news" and said people "want to publicize them" using his name.
His lawyers prepared to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that he was accused of paying her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
Speaking to his 142 million followers via Instagram live video hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, speculated the report was "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I was like, 'Oh, my God.
What he said today is false news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said, speaking to the cameras.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It is normal.
They are trying to get publicity with my name, but that is part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", the athlete continued with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue der Spiegel for the allegations, which they say are "an unacceptable gesture of suspicion in the private sector".
Attorney Christine Schertz said that the player could seek compensation "equivalent to the scope of the violation for moral damage, which is possibly one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times".
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorca allegedly went back to the player's room, where he raped her on her anus.
Mayorra claimed that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo leaned on his knee and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and "one percent" disappointed him.
The documents claimed that Ronaldo admitted to sexual relations, but said they were consensual.
Mayorka also claimed that she had gone to the police and had photos of her wounds taken in the hospital, but she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "revenge-driven" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
Mayorga, 34, says she is now pushing for a settlement because she is still distraught about the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was preparing to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will 'perpetually regret' being exempted from carmakers
If the UK were to cope with its post-Brexit status as the world leader in car manufacturing, "there would be permanent regrets", said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that "a matter of concern" was that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Barnston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that jobs could be lost if no-deal Brexit were to happen due to the impact of border delays.
The Burnston plant - where Toyota's Oris and Aventis were manufactured - produced nearly 1,50,000 cars last year, with the remaining 90% exported to the European Union.
"I think if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March we will see production at our factory stop", said Marvin Cook, managing director at Toyota in Burston.
Other UK carmakers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover expressed concern about how cross-border trade would work if they left the EU without a deal.
For example, BMW says they will close their mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the manufacturers is that the supply chain will be threatened if there is a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the "even in time" principle, where spare parts are delivered to cars on demand every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal before 29 March, there could be a border upheaval, and according to industry, delays and shortages for spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold supplies for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, and the company believes that would shut down production.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Checkers Plan for future relations with the EU is "very well-developed to avoid those checks at the border".
"We need a deal to be done, we want a deal that is the best, as I said, for now we not only want to be happy with making it a success, but we want to be able to take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC 4 today.
This is not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, for whom we need to maintain this idea, which will ensure a very successful supply chain.
Toyota could not say how long the production would stop, but in the long run, it warned that rising costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and, of course, affect jobs.
Peter Suvallaris, who worked at Burnstone for 24 years and is a union convener at the plant, said his members are extremely concerned: "In my experience, once they lose their jobs, they will never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
The White House said Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be rescheduled.
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week amid ongoing disputes over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which includes investigating Russian election interference, Trump's allies and Russia's links, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumors have been circulating in Washington for months that Trump will or will not show the Deputy Attorney General the way out, and that this could jeopardize Mueller's freedom.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein planted a wire to record conversations with Trump, which would have removed the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But he went to the White House last Monday and there was talk of his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would not be happy to remove Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that would include Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: 'There is no date for it, it could be this week, I think it could be postponed another week given the other issues going on with the Supreme Court.
But, we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed.
Some journalists argued that this was determined by: Sanders had not given a statement to the White House press since September 10.
The organizer, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of coverage was not due to hostility towards the TV reporters' performances.
He later suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"This president has more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she said, and then without providing any evidence, she said, "We've seen those numbers".
The spilling will continue, Sanders said, but if the reporters get a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's going to be so much better than talking to me.
We're trying very hard to do that, and you've seen it done in the last few weeks, and when you get to talk to the president of the United States, it's going to take the place of letting the press get away with it.
Trump regularly listens to questions when leaving the White House or attending an open session or press conference with visiting senior officials.
There are rarely press conferences alone.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated to the assembled press his reasons for carelessness and strange presentation.
Health Secretary writes to EU staff in NHS Scotland about concerns over Brexit.
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to stay after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to covering the cost of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in the public services for which they are responsible.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: "Throughout the summer, negotiations on leaving continued between the UK and the EU, with a decision expected in the autumn.
But the UK government is also preparing for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very uncomfortable time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate that I value the contribution of every member of the working class, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues in the EU and beyond bring invaluable skills and experience, which strengthen and improve healthcare performance, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we sincerely wish you to stay.
After suffering a head injury, Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery.
Tennessee's Mike Organ said Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's game, which they lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and crashed", Reid said.
The coach and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further diagnosis.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center and was out.
Harris added that the type or extent of the injury is not yet known and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, was playing his first season for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
Prior to the current game, he had taken a total of five tackles on Saturday, bringing his total for the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty for purchasing property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty for purchasing property in the UK and the extra money will be used for the homeless under the New Tory scheme.
This step will be a major contribution to the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
This stamp duty will be levied on people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
For help to the homeless - up to 12 crore pounds is expected to be added to the Treasury each year.
Theresa May will announce today that the extra money will be used to help the homeless, with preparations for a higher stamp duty on foreign buyers buying property in the UK.
The move will be seen as an attempt to overcome the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with a promise to provide more affordable housing and target the high earners.
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will boost the government's campaign to help people sleeping on the streets.
The surcharge will be along with the higher levels imposed on other houses two years ago, this will be along with the present stamp duty and it can be up to three percent more expensive to buy for rent.
The move is expected to add up to 12 crore pounds to the Treasury annually.
According to one estimate, 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, which increases their prices and makes it more difficult for first-time home buyers to take the step to acquire a home.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost villages due to foreign buyers, who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson cut stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
They accused the big construction companies of buying land but not using it, which drives up property prices, and urged Mrs May to remove her reservation on affordable housing, so that the UK's housing shortage could be addressed.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of striking proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and ending wrongful evictions.
They also want to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my Prime Ministership to restoring the dreams of the British people - of a better life for every new generation.
And that means restoring the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it will not be as easy for non-UK residents and overseas-based companies to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
For many, the dream of owning a house has become a distant dream, and the dreadful reality of those who sleep on the streets has become a reality.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to be the manager of Scotland.
Sunderland owner Jack Ross said his "ultimate goal" is to one day become Scotland manager.
The 42-year-old Scott is enjoying challenges as he revives the North-East club, three points short of the top spot and third in League One.
He has been at the Stadium of Light this summer, guiding St Mirren back into the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
But as a young boy, I grew up watching my father play Scotland at Hampden, and it's always fascinated me.
That opportunity will only come when I succeed in managing the club.
Ross was preceded as manager by Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo de Cano.
The former Alloa Athletic owner said he was not afraid to go after such well-established names at such a big club when his offers were rejected by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At this point, my success will be measured by whether I take this club to the Premier League.
He said that due to the structure and facilities at the club, the club is undoubtedly eligible to move to the Premier League.
It's not an easy task to get it there, but if I can get the club back there, then maybe I can consider myself successful.
After a 15-month stint as an assistant owner at Dumbarton and a trainee at Hearts, Ross' managerial career has been just three years.
He later helped Alloa improve from relegation to the third tier and took St Mirren from relegation the following season to the Championship.
And Ross says he's more satisfied than ever with his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
They remember that accepting Aloha's burden meant that maybe he was really smart.
"I really feel that management was more appropriate for me, even more than playing".
It seems strange because I played the right game, made a decent living out of it, and enjoyed some decent top spots.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still go through stressful and stressful work situations, but still management seems reasonable to me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, and I've had the greatest satisfaction of my adult life working for my own pleasure.

According to the survey, the exact time of drinking is 5:30 pm on Saturday.
The summer heat has boosted Britain's struggling pubs, but the pressure on restaurant chains has increased.
Pubs and bars grew by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, the data shows.
Peter Martin, CGA Business Advisory Centre who compiled the figures, said: "Continuous sunshine and England's longer than expected World Cup participation meant that in July, the same pattern was repeated as in June, with pubs up 2.8 per cent, except for a further shock to restaurants.
The decline in restaurant business of 1.8 per cent in June further increased in July.
Pubs and bars, which serve more drinks than restaurants, have performed very strongly.
Even the food service pubs, though not as dramatically as the restaurants, were also weakened by the heat.
It seemed that people only went out to drink.
The sales of drinks in well-managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent in the month, while consumption of foodstuffs decreased by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "We are seeing these results as a trend that has been going on since the end of April.
Where external market sales are concerned, the weather and important social or sporting events are the most effective factors.
The ongoing struggle of restaurant groups is not surprising, although a 4.8% decline from last year may be particularly painful over the ongoing spending pressures.
The long hot summer should not have come at a time when it was a tough time for the food vendors and only time will tell whether the moderate temperatures we experienced in August can provide much needed relief.
Including newly opened ones, the overall increase in sales in July in pubs and restaurants was 2.7%, reflecting a slowdown in brand roll-outs.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, which has a combined turnover of over £9bn and established industry benchmarks, oversees the sales of 47 such drivers and collects and analyses their performance data.
One in five children has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from their parents.
One in five children - around 11 years old - has a secret social media account, which he hides from his parents and teachers, the survey revealed.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Instagram pages.
This news has caused a lot of confusion that it is being posted with sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say that their main account is to show their parents.
One in five children -- who are about 11 years old -- are creating social media accounts, which they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that fake Instagram accounts are growing at a rapid rate.
This news has caused a lot of confusion that it is being posted with sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say that their cleaned up main accounts are for showing to their parents, and they also have their private accounts.
One mother was caught off guard when she saw her 13-year-old daughter's secret website asking others to rape her.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Council of Headmasters and Headmistresses of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40% of 11- to 18-year-olds had two acquaintances, and half of them admitted to having a private account.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It is extremely distressing to see so many teenagers eager to create online spaces that their parents and teachers will not be able to find".
Ailidh Doyle will be the voice of the players on the Scottish Athletics Board".
Ailidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a Non-Executive Director at the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is one of Scotland's most celebrated track and field athletes and Chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those who operate the sport to benefit from his extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
Ailidh is held in high esteem by the Scottish, UK and global gaming community and we are confident that bringing him on board will greatly benefit the players in Scotland", said BT.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be a voice for the sport and I hope to contribute and lead the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won four of his Olympic gold medals in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has now become a regular BBC pundit, having been left unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor said that only time would tell whether I would recover and how long.
It was exhausting, but I recovered completely, learned how to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!
Online votes were split over an advertisement for a breast pump comparing mothers to cows.
An ad by a breast pump company comparing breastfeeding women to dairy cows sparked online votes.
In launching what is believed to be the world's first silent breast pump, consumer tech company Elvini released a satirical music video ad featuring the freedom that the new pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance to the beat of the song in a cow-caged barn: "Yes, I give milk, but you can't see my tail". And "If you haven't noticed, they're not the clitoris, they're my breasts".
The chorus goes on to sing: "Pump it, pump it, I'm feeding the babies, pump it, pump it, I'm draining my women's milk".
But the ad posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many feeling that the dairy industry's approach was too shallow.
It is a very poor decision to use cows for the promotion of this product.
Except for the fact that their baby is taken away from them within days of birth, they, like us, become pregnant and give birth to a baby to breastfeed.
The Elvis Breast Pump fits neatly inside the breast-feeding bra.
Another commented: "Of course, it's annoying for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have their babies?
Another wrote: "This is also an irrelevant ad".
While others supported the ad, one woman admitted that the song was "funny".
I think that's a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would have taken one.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This is a bit crazy, but I think it's appropriate for the job.
"This is an unusual product", one wrote.
Another commented: "This funny ad is for mothers who pump (usually in their workplace or toilet) and feel like cows".
This is not a complimentary advertisement or a speculative advertisement about the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, she reveals that a group of women were dancing with pumps neatly fitted in their bra.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the view of many women who use breast pumps feel like cows.
However, the Elvy pump is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes, and fits perfectly into a nursing bra, allowing women freedom of movement, can pick up children, and even go outside during pumping.
Anna Ballarin, Partner and ECD at MADER, said: "Elvi Pump is a revolutionary product that needs to be launched in an open and stimulating manner.
By drawing parallels between breastfeeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges while demonstrating the amazing sense of freedom that the new pumps offer in an entertaining and relevant way.
This is not the first time that the Elvy pump has been in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, for designer Marta Jakubovsky, a mother of two children was seen catwalking with this product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to tent camps on the Texas border.
While monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, the number of immigrant children detained increased in part, as the harsh language and policies put forward by the Trump administration have made it difficult to keep children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are undocumented immigrants themselves, and when they come forward to adopt a child, they are afraid of jeopardizing their own ability to keep themselves in that country.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household would have to have their fingerprints taken, and that data would be handed over to immigration authorities.
Last week, senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Matthew Albans testified before Congress, saying the agency arrested some people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal, and a large proportion of them are involved in criminal activities.
So we have started tracking such people, Mr. Albans said.
To speed up the process of the children, the authorities introduced new rules, according to the shelter workers, some of them will have to appear in court within a month from their detention, instead of the previous standard of 60 days.
Many will attend through video conference instead of appearing in person to present their petition for legal status before the Immigration Judge.
Those who are deemed unfit for assistance will be immediately deported from the country.
According to shelter workers and system income reports from recent months, the longer children are in custody, the more anxious or depressed they may become, leading to violent tendencies or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are particularly prevalent in large facilities like Tornillo, where the overcrowding of children there, the neglected children, is seen to be the most struggling.
He further said that not giving children taken to tent cities time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends, is causing additional trauma to children who are already struggling.
Syria has asked the US, French and Turkish occupying forces to leave the country immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'ulem also called for the return of the Syrian surrendered, even though the war in the country has now reached its eighth year.
Mowlem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign military forces on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism are illegal and will be dealt with fairly.
They were told to leave the country immediately and not to be subjected to any conditions.
Maullem stressed that the war against terrorism in Syria is almost over, with 360,000 people killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight this holy war until all Syrian terrorists and any foreign entity are purged from the terrorist group.
The United States has more than 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the question of the surrender, Maulaim said that he was in a favorable position to return, but blamed some foreign countries for spreading unreasonable fear, which led to the surrender.
We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return, he said.
They are making politics of what should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has given journalists a chance to get ahead of the political narrative.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a major offensive on the Russian-backed Syrian province of Senevara, where three million people live.
However, Maulaim stressed that there was a "clearly set deadline" for the deal and expressed hope that the military action would target and root out the jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda.
UN Ambassador Stefan de Mistura is hoping that the first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition members will soon be held to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mauleimani set out the conditions for the inclusion of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to the manual assessment of the current situation and warned against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Second Term
According to that argument, as many liberals might have hoped, the impeachment and unpleasant incident would bring his presidency to an early end, but if that did not happen, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020.
There is no doubt that this will be the most dramatic presidential final ever!
To date, there are no signs of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings from CNN have doubled to 1.05 million, while prime-time ratings from MSNBC have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nelson, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show topped cable ratings, with 3.5 million viewers watching on Major News Nights.
"It's also a fire that people are being drawn to, because it's not something that we understand", said Neil Baer, director of the ABC drama "Designated Sovereign", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Neil Scovel, a famous comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys Club, had a different theory.
She recalls a trip in a Boston cab before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh", Miss Scovell told me.
There is value in entertainment in this disorder.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story coming from Washington will determine the future of Raw V: madness, whether immigrant families can reunite and whether the global economy is healthy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes through your head, even as a knowledgeable citizen, when you see a panel of experts arguing at six o'clock, including Bob Woodward's use of deep background for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 oyster-leather bomber jacket (a thick cloth with hubris, the Washington Post said), and Storm Daniel's Mr. Trump, with his suggestive description of inflammatory anatomy.
I, for one, will never look back at Super Mario the same way.
Brent Montego Marie, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of "Pon Stars", said of the changing cast and daily plot twists of Trump's show (praising Kim Jong-un and arguing with the NFL), "I think they're delivering something every night through a reality show.
You can't miss a single part, because that will leave you behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss's house this week, it was a beautiful sunny day and 80 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, but he was immersed in watching CNN recordings and MSNBC.
He couldn't shake himself from him, not from Brett Kavanaugh, who is ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is uncertain.
I remember when we were doing all that crazy stuff during the day and people were saying, "Western civilization is starting to end", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out to be true.

There is a flood of money in the highly contested midterm House race.
It is no wonder Pennsylvania is seeing a 17th cash flood, which is responsible for the congressional redistricting that put two candidates in the race for the same seat.
It recently re-elected Democratic Republican Conor Lamb in suburban Pittsburgh, who won his seat from the other district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stood in front of the other candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who was currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th District, which was largely occupied with the new 17th.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally unfairly divided in favor of Republicans, the maps were redrawn.
The race for the new 17th has sparked a campaign of economic strife between the main party's financial wing, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a widely watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won that district by 20 points.
The political pundits gave a little leaning to the Democrats.
El Salvador decided to punish for US support for China, then changed the decision
Diplomats noted that after a slight retreat from Washington, the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varella, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the disappearance of a partner in the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials recalled the U.S. chiefs of diplomatic missions from their recent decision not to recognize Taiwan by El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, Department spokeswoman Heather Neurt said earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $14 million in US aid in 2017, including drug controls, development and financial assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country, which has a high rate of unemployment and homicides.
As the internal meeting moved forward, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar summit last year, which was seen as a step in efforts to stem the flow of immigrants toward the United States.
But by mid-September, the top administration made clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively end any sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now address the summit, which is now scheduled for mid-October and the summit will be convened at the discretion of the administrative regions, the diplomats said.
And without any new harsh message or punishment from Washington, all three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
For Mr. Bolton, a White House spokesman declined to give details of the discussion, which was described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who had agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on terms of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outside analyst, who was close to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study history is not a good thing.
The next major incident may be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which is now highly substantiated in public records.
According to reports, Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation, his election campaign, his attacks on Russia into a conspiracy of Mr Trump's campaign.
If Congress changes sides, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that institution, as he prepares to go before the voters once again, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peers.
There are many ifs, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump is doomed or that his counterparts in Europe are doomed.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have choices that will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, if the West had opposed Hitler and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich, the German authorities were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler.
We failed and missed the chance to avoid bloodshed in the coming year.
The study of history has focused around such issues of disagreement and the uninterrupted progress of democracy has been accelerated or delayed .
The United States is now grappling with some of these issues of disagreement.
What would we do if Mr. Trump removed Vice President General Rod Rosenstein, who was handling the investigation of Mr. Mueller?
Since the newspaper reported that last year, Rosestein had been in trouble for conceiving that he was secretly recording the president and that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstahl believes the Times account is flawed.
What exactly would we do if the new FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh was not complete or fair - or if it was decided to send him to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual misconduct and dishonesty?
Besides, we will hold a midterm election for Congress and Mr. Trump will be held accountable for that?
But if we fail in this, democracy will be buried deep for a long time.
But I believe we will not fail, because I have learned a lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had to be deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazis who once occupied my embassy.
But she survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me to light Sabbath candles on the same table with the swastika.
This is my history, so why not be positive about the future?

Rapid Vienna was organized by Rangers on Thursday.
The win over Austria and the dramatic draw with Villarreal in Spain this month are likely to put them in danger of qualifying for Europa League Group G.
A knee injury has prevented Graham from starting the season strongly, but he believes the Rangers should see the 2-2 draw against Villarreal as the start of another brilliant campaign.
The 31-year-old said, "It was a good game for us because Villarreal is a dynamic team".
We started the game thinking we were going to do something good and score points.
"Maybe we could have done it in the end, but overall, a draw was probably the right decision.
They were probably better in the first half and we came in the second half and we were on top.
Thursday is another big night in Europe.
"We hope to get three points but it will be a difficult game because even though they have good points in the last game, with the support of the people we have, I am sure we will definitely get a positive result.
"Last year was really tough, in all aspects, the injury and the changes at the club but still this place is a good thing.
The team is great and the kids are really enjoying it; the training is great.
Fortunately, we can try to do that now, move past the past and succeed".
This retirement saving fear has robbed women of their sleep.
Despite having a clear idea of how to care for the survey participants, some people were talking to their family members.
In a nationwide study, nearly half of respondents said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of those interviewed said so.
"People want their family members to take care of them, but they're not taking any steps to communicate", said Holly Snader, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Start here.
Talk to your partner and your children about this: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Consult with your counselor about where and how to take care, and discuss with your family, so that the choice of these things can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Talk to your financial advisor: The advisor can suggest some ways to pay for these expenses.
Your fund options for long term care may include a traditional long term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own property.
Get your legal paperwork out: Finish the legal stuff ahead of time.
Get a healthcare proxy so you can appoint a trusted person to handle your medical care and make sure that professionals follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider a power of attorney for your financial matters.
You'll need to find someone you can trust and make sure that your bills are paid if you're incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and need to be taken to the hospital.
Can You Answer Questions About Medicines and Allergies?
Keep all these details in writing so that you are ready.
"This picture is not just about the financial stuff, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Plan ahead for it".
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle on his way home after spending a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Officials described the exact shooting that occurred at about 2:30 BST as an "irreverent act".
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police have appealed to witnesses.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday killed at least 384 people, with officials saying the death toll could rise.
Due to the contact shock, relief officials could not get any information from Dongla Regency, which flows north of Palu and is at the center of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people in Palu were evacuated after the disaster.
The following are the highlights from Palo and Dongla on Sulawesi Island:
Palo is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongla is a regency extending 300 km (180 mi) from the northwestern coast of Sulawesi Island.
Regency, the province comes under the administrative region, which had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstay of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongla.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but is more concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, in the last 100 years, Palu and Dongola have been hit by several tsunamis.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami hit the West Hills, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the recent year are:
2004: On December 26, 2004, a major earthquake struck the west coast of the Aceh island of North Sumatra, Indonesia, triggering a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people, half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 2006: A 6.8-magnitude tsunami hit the south of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, which broke the southern coastline, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: 2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the island of Mentawai on Sumatra, creating a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the PD Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing widespread destruction and panic, reminding people of the devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died when buildings collapsed.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, was hit by a major earthquake, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists.
Sarah Pauline's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
According to a report released by Alaska state officials, a 29-year-old male from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and for interfering with domestic violence reports and resisting arrest.
According to police reports, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the crime, he took away her phone.
Palin is being remanded to the Mart-Su pretrial facility and is being held on a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
According to media reports, he was brought before a court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" during questioning.
Palin faces a third-degree felony, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a second-degree felony, which carries a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pauline.
His mother, Sarah Pauline, had called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence crime reports, and possessing a drug in connection with the incident.
His friend had accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups after she linked PTSD stemming from her son's service in Iraq to violent behavior in 2016.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake caused a tsunami, and thousands of homes were destroyed.
Power and communications are down for the next few days and the death toll is expected to rise.
The epicenter was far from Central Sulawesi, which is in the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the impact of that moment are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach in the city of Palamo to celebrate when the tsunami hit the wall.
Federal prosecutors demanding a strict death penalty for suspected New York terrorists
The state is seeking the death penalty for Syflow Sypov, a federal prosecutor in New York who is suspected of the New York terror attacks that killed eight people - the most severe sentence the state has given for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov used a rented Home Depot truck to attack a two-wheeler road near the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October.
To qualify for the death penalty under the intent to execute, filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "knowingly" killed those eight victims and "knowingly" inflicted serious physical harm.
According to court documents, the death penalty can be upheld in both cases.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of racketeering-assisted murder, in general: federal prosecutors and destruction of motor vehicles in organized crime cases.
Describing what Saipov did as "heinous, brutal and outrageous", the prosecutor said the attack required "extensive planning and advance warning".
"Safflo Habilyevic Saipov has caused pain, harm and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Laure Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián Pagnuko".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York heard a case that sentenced him to death.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were sentenced to death in a New York federal trial two years earlier for conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days before the attack.
Police said he told investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told investigators that he was inspired to attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone.
Police say he also requested that the Isis flag be placed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the alleged 22 counts.
David Patton, a federal public defender representing Saipov, said he was "totally disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the death penalty should be imposed, that any demand for life imprisonment should be accepted, and that it would increase the suffering of all those involved in this incident", Patton said.
The Saipov Defence had earlier asked prosecutors not to hand down the death penalty.
MP Tory said Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
During the Tory Council protests, Nigel Farage vowed to form the 'People's Army Association'.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should be wary of Eurosceptics - as suggested by Theresa May, they should have the means to negotiate with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone told a crowd in Birmingham that if Mr Farage had been the Brexit secretary, the UK would have 'gone out of it' by now.
But the obstacles they face in bridging Mrs May's group's divisions are made more clear by the fact that Remain Tory supporters have staged separate anti-Brexit demonstrations in the city.
They are also having to learn to maintain their checkered compliance plans in the storm of criticism from Brexiteers, Remonstrators and the EU.
The allies say that despite opposition they should try to establish relations with Brussels and pressure the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their proposed plans or 'confusion'.
Mr. Bone explained to the Leave Me Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'end the relationship with the Chequers'.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be brought along and given the responsibility of negotiations with Brussels.
If they had these formulas, we would be out by now,' he said.
Wellingborough MPs said: "I will stand for Brexit, but we must get the checkers out".
Regarding his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not participate in the World War to get second place".
We want our laws in our country.
Mr. Bone denied that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election, saying: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds, their demands and now they want to stay in the same system is wrong".
Tory Brexitist Andrea Jenkins was also present at the rally, speaking to reporters, saying: "I would just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
There is a general anger about the Chequers, the opposition will not vote for them, there is an anti-Chequers atmosphere in our party and among our activists who have planned this path by electing us to the top.
Please, leave the checkered ones and start listening to others.
In a clear message to Mrs May, he said: 'The PM can only hold office if he keeps his word.'
Addressing the Morcha, Shri Farage said that the politicians who are trying to betray the popular vote in 2016 should be punished.
Now it has become a question of trust between us, the people and our political class, he added.
They are trying to betray Brexit, and we want to tell them today, right here, right now, that we will not let you do that.
Addressing the elated crowd, he said: "I think you should teach this lesson to our politicians who are going down that path of betraying Brexit".
"We are building an army of the people of this country, which will win us over Brexit, and which will not be able to stand until we have a United Kingdom that is independent, self-governing and proud".
Meanwhile, the Remnants marched on Birmingham before marching for two hours in the city centre.
This weekend, some activists set up a group and displayed signs such as Tories Against Brexit.
Lord Adonis, a friend of the Labour Party, took the Conservatives to task with security issues in the party app as the conference began.
These are the same people who are telling us that the IT system is working well and all these technologies will make Canada Plus Plus, there will be peace on the border, free trade without the Irish border and so on", he said.
This is all fake.
There is no such thing as a proper Brexit", he added.
Warren will seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November elections.
According to The Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat was speaking about her future plans during a town hall in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a consistent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff D.L., who was also co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There is talk that he will stand against Trump in the 2020 election.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday was the 36th meeting with voters in the town hall system since Trump took office.
A member here asked him if he is considering running for the presidency.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to keep our messy government going", Warren said, "and that means women in the highest office".
One arrested in the murder of LSU Sims
Baton Rouge, LA police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wyde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department said that 20-year-old DeTeon Simpson was arrested at the 11 o'clock ET news conference.
The police had released a video of the shooting and appealed for the identification of the person in the video footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media, according to 247Sports.
Wade jumped in to save his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted during police questioning that he was at the scene, had a gun, and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was easily arrested by police and is being held in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6 junior basketball player, grew up in Baton Rouge, and has played in 32 games, starting 10 of them this past season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton Yow, who took the field at the team's command, saluted Sebastian Vettel to win the world title
It was only when Valtteri Bottas qualified with more points than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that it was clear that Mercedes' command was now going to be important in the competition.
Bottas had started well from pole, replacing Hamilton in the first two turns and almost knocking out Hamilton, so it was time for Vettel to beat his own team-mate.
Leaving Hamilton at the end of the pack in traffic, Wettle went into the pits first, which was supposed to be the decisive action.
Mercedes then again bet and made a run for Vettel's back seat, but after a few very interesting moments Hamilton took the lead and the Ferrari driver had to reluctantly release the inside, risking a double move for third place.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first stage of the competition, which was held on his 21st birthday.
But then he spent most of the rest of the race holding on to his car and went on to finish the race, beating Kimi Räikkönen for fourth place.
He finally got into the pits on lap 44, but with Ryokan in fourth place, he was unable to increase his speed.
It was a really tough day, and Valtteri did a great job, and he's a very gentleman.
The team has done an amazing job of getting one two", said Hamilton.
This is really bad behavior.
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has been accused of sexual harassment by Christine Blasé Ford, but the letter from Ford claiming that he did not have the allegations was not released, Senator Diane Feinstein said, referring to the allegations made by Feinstein at a meeting convened by President Donald Trump on Saturday.
Speaking to the West Virginia meeting, the president directly referred to Ford, without mentioning Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying that what is going on in the Senate is showing how 'selfish, irritable and lying' people have become.
"What's been going on in the Senate these past few days, what's going to happen... when you see the anger there, you see people who are angry, irritable, selfish and lying".
"You look at the flyers, you leak it, and then you say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.'"
I did not.
Do you remember?
D.A. Feinstein, did you leak this?
And they said, "Did you leak these documents?" "What, what did you say?"
Oh, no. I was just...
I didn't leak them.
Um, wait a minute.
Did we leak it... No, we didn't"... The president made a very senator-style statement.
A letter was sent to Feinstein in July about the allegations made against Kavangou by Ford and leaked in early September... Feinstein has denied that the letter was leaked from his office.
I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, but I did not leak his letter, as Feinstein told the committee, The Hill Reporter reported.
They told me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret.
The president, however, was not impressed by their refusal. He said at a meeting on Saturday night: "I tell you, this is a very bad thing to do".
They may not have done it, but it was the worst kind of behavior I've ever seen.
Advocating for the Supreme Court delegation accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President said that these Democrats are using the allegations to their advantage.
They want to regain power by doing anything.
You see the selfishness, the cowardice, they don't care if they're hurting someone, they don't care who they're crushing to gain power and dominance", the president said, according to Mediat.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for their loss in the Elite League on Friday by beating the Belfast Giants 5-3 in their return match on Saturday.
Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bovillier scored early in the game, giving the Giants an immediate two-goal lead.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney had tied the host team before Dwyer regained the lead for the Giants.
Franco Baucard tied Dundee and then Lucas Lundwald Nielsen scored the winning goal.
This is the third defeat in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's side, who had previously come back from a 2-1 defeat to Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two teams this season, with the Giants winning the previous three.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 minutes, four minutes before the game started, on the strength of Kendall McFaul's assist. Four minutes later, on the strength of David Rutherford's assist, Bovillier scored a goal to double the team's lead.
The first half of the match was a busy one. Sullivan scored a goal in the 13:10th minute to keep the hosts in the lead, and then at 15:16 with the help of Matt Marquardt, Cooney scored a goal to tie the game.
At the end of the first period, Dwyer scored his second goal, suggesting that the Giants would have regained the lead at the first break.
"Jayman's team once again made a turn and in the 27:37th minute, Baucard scored a power play goal to once again level the team".
Cooney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen score, and Dundee took the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half, scoring the fifth goal in the penultimate period of the game to seal the team's victory.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will now play their next game on Friday against Milton Keynes at their home ground.
Air traffic controller who saved hundreds of passengers from earthquake dies
An air traffic controller who saved a plane carrying hundreds of passengers from death after making sure it took off safely is a hero for Indonesia.
The powerful earthquake that hit Sulawesi on Friday has killed 800 people, while many are still missing, and has triggered a tsunami.
The entire area has been devastated by the strong aftershocks and many people in the city of Palu are trapped under the cliffs.
The control manor at Mutyar Siss Al Zufri Airport in Palu was shaken by the quake. While other colleagues fled the manor for fear of their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung explicitly refused to leave his post.
At that time, Battic Air Flight 6321 was on runway 621 and did not move from its position to ensure that it could fly safely.
He then jumped from the road after sensing that the traffic controller was crashing.
He later died in the hospital.
His decision may have saved hundreds of passengers, said Johannes Sirat, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, as reported by ABC News of Australia.
We had a helicopter equipped at Balikappan, Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost this helicopter this morning before it reached the turn.
He added, "We are deeply saddened to hear this news".
Meanwhile, the authorities fear the death toll could reach 1,000, and the Emergency Management Agency says it is difficult to reach all parts of Donggala, Singye and Baotong.
"The death toll is likely to rise further as many bodies are still buried under debris and we have not been able to reach them", the agency spokesperson said.
Waves of up to six meters have devastated the city of Palu.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering relief and essential supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old woman, told Sky News: "Every minute, the morgue is bringing bodies in.
Clean water is scarce.
There is robbery in small markets everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors but we don't know exactly what they will get there".
It's already a very sad situation, but it can get much worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military: "I am telling you all to work day and night to complete every task related to the deportation.
Are you ready? CNN reported this.
Earlier this year, Indonesia's Lombok region was struck by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Nuyugini now says one person is missing after plane crashed in the bay.
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in the Gulf of the Pacific in Micronesia now says one passenger is missing after the crash. The airline had earlier said that 47 passengers and crew on the sinking plane had been safely evacuated.
Air Nuyugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, the airline had not received the address of a male passenger.
We are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate this individual.
When asked for more details such as age or nationality of the passenger, the airline did not immediately respond.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane went overboard while trying to land at the airport on the island of Fallujah.
Seven people have been taken to hospital, officials said on Friday.
Six of the passengers were in hospital on Saturday and all are in stable condition, the airline said.
The exact cause and sequence of the crash are still unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed before it reached the runway.
Some eyewitnesses believe that the plane went beyond the runway.
American passenger Bill Jennings said the plane came down too low.
Janice said, "It was a really good thing.
Janice said that she and the other passengers got out of the sinking plane through the emergency exit and walked through the water to the waist.
He said the flight crew were frightened and screaming, and suffered minor head injuries.
Some nearby boats were being repaired, and the U.S. Navy said it was helping to rescue the crew by taking them to shore in an inflatable boat before the plane sank, which then sank to a depth of 30 meters (100 feet).
The Aviation Safety Network has reported 111 fatalities in the last two years in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines, but not a single Air New Guinea aircraft.
Analysts have described the events of the night the woman was burned alive.
The state party on Saturday completed its argument in a search for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the US Department of Justice, was given an hour-long testimony as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he checked cell phone records to find out exactly what happened between her and the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tallis, the night that 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers died.
He said he collected location data from several cell phones to make sure Telles was with Chambers the evening she died, which Telles had previously claimed he was not.
According to available data, his cell phone appeared to be near Chambers' cell phone at the time, and Telles said he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Sanford about Tallis' claim that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said Tallis was lying.
Another difference is that we knew Chambers two weeks before she died, Telles said.
Cell phone records show that they only knew each other a week ago.
Some time after Chambers' death, Telles deleted all of her messages, calls, contact information from his phone, Rowlett said.
"He took her out of his life", Hale said.
The defence will begin its final argument on Sunday.
The case is expected to go before the jury on the same day, the judge said.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
By filling their music with positive messages, the hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions of this genre.
Hip hop has strayed from its original purpose of addressing political messages as well as social issues, claims High Breed of Bristol.
They want to go back to their roots and bring conscious hip hop back into the mainstream.
Artists from groups like Fugees and Common have seen the UK's revolt through the hands of artists like Akala and Lauki.
Another black person?!
A nanny in New York sues a couple for being fired from their job based on a "racial" message
"A nanny in New York is suing a couple for being fired for racial misconduct after her mother mistakenly sent us a message claiming she is "another black person".
The couple has denied the racial charges, claiming that the lawsuit is a form of "divorce".
When the new nanny first came on the job in 2016, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed displeasure at the discovery that she was black.
"No SSSSSSSSSSSSSSS is another black" was the message that Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to send to her husband.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she accidentally sent it to Mrs. Morris, who also sent it twice.
After noticing the mess, the "difficult" Pasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, who had a previous nanny who was African-American and did a bad job, and told her that she needed a Filipino nanny, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Morris was paid for a day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now Mrs. Morris and her husband are suing for a reduction in their salary, claiming $350 a day for six months, and having been hired with the promise of a full-time job, but without a deal.
"I want to show them that you can't be like that", she told the Post on Friday. "I know, it's racist", she added.
The couple denied that they were racist, claiming that they could not be trusted because of the hurt they had caused Mrs Morris, and that it was only reasonable to fire them in such circumstances.
"My wife sent them something she didn't want to say".
It's not racist.
We are not racist people", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But, after you've been rude to someone, would you hand your children over to the same person, and then the rude behavior would be a mistake?"
Would you hand your newborn baby to that person?
It's not possible".
Accusing the case of being a "breakdown", Plasco said his wife had given birth two months ago and was currently in "a very difficult situation".
"Is someone following someone like this?"
"It's not a very good thing", said Plasco, a business investment banker.
While the court case is still ongoing, the court of Janmatie has criticized the couple through social media, with strong criticism being leveled at their behaviour and their arguments.
Paddington publishers were concerned that readers might not accept the idea of a talking bear, a new letter revealed.
The book was accepted by the British Royal Society in 1926, and the daughter of James Bond, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly afterward, said of the letter: "It is difficult to know what the mood of the first reader will be before the book is published".
It's very interesting to know what we know about Paddington's tremendous success".
She says that the father, who wrote children's books inspired by a small toy bear after working as a cameraman for the BBC, would have remained optimistic even if the book had been rejected. She also says that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "compounded" because of his death last year.
She describes Paddington as "a very important member of our family", adding that her father is very proud of his eventual success.
"They were very quiet. They never wanted to blink themselves", she said.
"But Paddington was really a barrier for them, so if your son accomplishes something, it's something you're proud of, even if it's not your own doing.
I think that's how they looked at Paddington's success.
It was his invention, his imagination, and yet he always credited Paddington".
My daughter was counting the last element, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Lou Pasteur-Tou Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her but to no avail.
"Nad called me regularly and told me that things were so bad that she didn't think she would get out of it", said Mrs. Ednan-Laparouse.
"Then I got a call from Ned and he said she was going to die in two minutes and I wanted to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye to her.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication that doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping was slowly failing and her entire system was shutting down.
She had just died and everything was closing.
I just wanted to sit and wait, knowing that everything was coming together.
I couldn't scream, I couldn't scream, I couldn't cry, because I was surrounded by so many families and so many people.
I really had to prove myself".
Finally, Mrs. Adnan-Laprau, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what they were going through.
"No one knew", she said.
"I was downcast and tears were pouring down my eyes.
It's a little hard to explain, but I was feeling a lot of empathy for Ned on the plane.
He needed my love, I needed him to understand.
I knew how much he loved her".
Grief-stricken women post cards to prevent suicides from bridges.
Two women who lost their lovers to suicide are now working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys post inspirational messages and cards with phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge, which people can call to get help.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler had been plagued by depression since he was 13 years old, and he took his own life at 18.
"I don't want any parent to have time to experience what I go through every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, lives in Lydney, and her son was an up-and-coming chef with a smile that would make anyone laugh.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
"Everyone always said that his smile would brighten up any place".
But he had abandoned his work before he died, because he had "lived a long time indeed".
Tyler committed suicide in 2014, with his 11-year-old brother watching him die.
"I'm still worried that it's going to have an indirect effect on him", Mrs. David said.
Mrs. David made cards, "To let these people know that there are people you can go to, people you can talk to, it could be any of your friends.
Don't sit still - you need to talk".
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davis have been friends for many years. Mrs. Humphreys lost her husband of 15 years, Mark, who also took his own life shortly after his mother died.
"He never said he was depressed, he never said he was depressed. He never said anything", she said.
"A few days after Christmas, we began to notice a slight change in his attitude.
He had no money in his pocket on Christmas Day - he didn't look at them when the kids opened their presents".
She said that his death was a huge shock to her family, but we got through it. "It created a rift in the family.
It divided us.
But all we have to do is keep going and keep fighting".

With the FBI opening an investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future is in the balance.
"I thought that if we really got something like he was asking for - an investigation that was completed in a certain time, limited opportunity - then maybe we could bring a little bit of unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that he was "broken" by the habit of the Committee Party's gridlock.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
They are reluctant simply because of time.
With only six weeks left until the midterm elections, which are on November 6th - if the Republicans do not perform as expected, their efforts to send the man elected to the nation's highest court will be severely weakened.
Mr. Kavanaugh picked up the phone to call Senator George W. Bush to form a panel of supporters. Mr. Kavanaugh worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and it was through him that Mr. Kavanaugh met his wife, Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI submits a report?
The 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will vote in the current Senate.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow him to evenly split Mike Pence, the vice president, and keep him on the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's leadership, the number of North Korean infiltrators has decreased by 50 percent.
South Korean lawmakers say the number of North Korean intruders entering South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, Park Byong-sung said that the number of intruders last year was 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strong border controls between North Korea and China and the high money taken from human trafficking were important factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Many North Korean intruders have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that in 1953, at the end of the Korean War, more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border illegally.
Many grew up in China, which has a large border with North Korea, and crossing this border is easier than crossing the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats illegal immigrants as refugees rather than refugees and forcibly returns them.
Relations between North and South - although still technically at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss nuclear non-proliferation talks.
This follows the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they discussed a wide range of issues regarding the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blasted the lack of progress since then on the US sanctions.
"We cannot be confident about our national security without trust in the United States, and we cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally under such circumstances", Re said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "unconscious" and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "unbelievable" and said he was unable to serve on the Supreme Court for some time.
Pelosi was speaking in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I can't do anything about it, but I think if a woman did it, they would call her 'bevan,'" Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very upset when he started speaking, sometimes screaming, sometimes holding his neck, when he talked about his family and his high school days.
The accusation against him was that, in a concerted effort to express anger over Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election, he made a clear accusation against Democrats of "a bizarre and coordinated murder of character".
Pelosi has said that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he cannot serve on the Supreme Court, because it proves that he is biased in regards to Democrats.
"I think they've disqualified themselves by their statements and by following Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
She was reluctant to ask whether Pelosi would question his legitimacy if Kavanaugh was appointed and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say -- if they're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, they're not fit to be in the Supreme Court, not just the court they're in right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat he is concerned about the possible handling of the Kavanaugh Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade lawsuit against him, because Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Mr. Kavanaugh left out the question of whether you would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time for some unconscious, biased person to go to court and expect you to say, 'Oh, that's so cool!'", Pelosi said.
And women need to use their weapons.
The right voice has been raised, months and years have passed, and she had no choice but to cry.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinmeier told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, what do you think?"
She continued, "I was very supported by a woman who worked as an executive somewhere, and she said that she was so angry that she started crying, but she developed a technique where when she was yelling and crying, she would say to the person who was speaking, "You can think I'm crying because I'm in pain.
I'm mad at you".
And then she kept saying it.
And I thought it was amazing".
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger because there are fundamental misconceptions about them.
One of the most vivid memories of my early career is in a male-dominated office, where I once saw myself crying uncomfortably and angrily, when an elderly woman - the cold-blooded manager I always feared - grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the wall of the gym.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They didn't know you were angry.
They think you are sad and they will be happy for it.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for the presidential race.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business, Mrs. Schroeder was very disappointed and began to wonder why she herself should not run for president.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she told me, laughing 30 years later.
"There are already seven candidates in the race, and the last thing they want is another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
"They were behind in fundraising because of the delay in the campaign, and so they decided not to get into the fight until they had the $2 million".
It was a losing battle.
She found that her supporters who gave men $1,000 gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought to herself.
The emotions they felt when announcing they would not launch a formal campaign - gratitude for the people who supported them, anger at the system that made it difficult to raise money, and anger at representation and sexuality rather than targeting voters - were exacerbated by the fact that they were so uneasy.
"You must have thought I was crazy", Mrs. Schroeder said of the newspaper's admonition to her.
"You might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my headstone?
"Why did she cry?"
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
With the rumblings of a trade war between the US and China, and no sign of an end to the war, experts say the gap between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump has issued his first warning by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week there has been a massive increase in tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has resisted each time by paying tariffs on imported goods of five to 10 percent of the most recent $60 billion of US goods.
China has vowed to follow in the footsteps of the United States and soon the world's largest economy will never be ignored.
Washington's withdrawal is a demand, but to publicly salute the United States would be a very uncomfortable thing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its game properly, China can provide positive long-term support by reducing the interdependence of the two economies under the pressure of the US trade wars.
In fact, the economic loop that would start in either country if a quick political decision was made in Washington or Beijing is more dangerous than people have previously accepted", said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
The foreign minister says Syria is 'ready' to return refugees.
Syria is ready to voluntarily return refugees and has asked for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Maolem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the progress made in fighting terrorism has made the situation in our region more stable and secure", he said.
To improve the normal situation, the government has started rehabilitation in the areas destroyed by terrorists.
The conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave their country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country are in need of philanthropy.
Al-Maolem said the Syrian government would help rebuild the devastated country.
But he insisted that he would not accept any conditional aid or assistance from any armed supporting countries.
Europe has sealed the Ryder Cup in Paris
At Le Golf National outside Paris, France, the European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5.
The U.S. has lost six straight times in Europe and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The Danish team, led by captain Thomas Bjorn, regained the crown for Europe by beating the United States by 14.5 points.
American star Phil Mickelson struggled in many contests, he dipped his T-shot in the water at the par-3 16th hole to face Francisco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari became the first player in the four to shine in all of his finals, taking a 5-0-0 lead since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The lowest ranked player in the European team, Thorborn Olesen of Denmark, was knocked out by American Jordan Spieth by a score of 5-4.
World's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson was 2-1 behind England's Ian Poulter, who may have played for the final Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup veteran, Sergio Garcia of Spain became the all-time European champion with a career score of 25.5.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't do anything.
It's been a rough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for his trust in me.
I am very happy that I have recovered the cup.
It's about the team and I'm happy that I'm able to help", said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the torch to his countryman John Rahm who on Sunday beat US golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a single game.
Rahm, 23, said, "I feel incredibly proud to defeat Tiger Woods, the man I grew up watching".
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
"A strange statistic was made by one of the greatest athletes of all time, Jack Nicklaus, who won only 14 major titles".
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-performance golf throughout the tournament, the USA team traveled the entire weekend to find the fairway.
Captain Jim Furyk of the USA commented on his team's disappointing performance, "I am proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we tried to put pressure on the European team.
We fought with bravery.
Greetings to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played great games.
"We'll reconcile the team, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You should praise them.
We got out.
Red Tide Update: Concentrations of Pinellas, Manate and Sarasota have dropped significantly
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, patchers are being reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - leading to lower concentrations.
The Red Tide has stretched 130 miles of coastline from Pinellas in the north to Lee counties in the south.
Patches are found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer sites than last week.
Red tides have also been detected in Pasco County.
"In the past week, we have recorded a central concentration in Pinellas County or along the coast, low to high concentrations along the coast of Hilleboro County, a background high concentration in Manatee County, a background high concentration on a main road or along the coast in Sarasota County, a background medium concentration in Charlotte County, a background high concentration in Lee County or along the coast, and a background low concentration in Collier County.
Respiratory distress continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory distress was reported in northwest Florida last week.
