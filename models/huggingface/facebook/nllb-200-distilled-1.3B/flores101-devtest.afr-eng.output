Not only does it confirm that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, which is already a widely held theory, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal are chestnut brown above with a pale or carotid-colored underside.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed shaft, also called the rhachis, but they had other features of feathers - shaft feathers and bearded silk branches - the researchers concluded that the rhachis may have been a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or rejection. The researchers suggest that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not chick dimples.

The work done is mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by gravitational forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the galaxy's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the earth, causing the tides, so the Milky Way exerts an attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found in a type of corona, and is made up of very small particles.

Their thermal behavior is not as moderate as large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with these deep holes in the ground, says Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astro-Geology Team and of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting was traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolated themselves in a box, and then put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter roll.
French electoral law has codified these procedures rather strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes were present at the start of the election and that no envelopes were added except those counted and by registered voters.
Candidates can send representatives to follow each part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, according to specific procedures.

The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
She is in custody pending her indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be affected because her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish legal systems work differently and courts have seen publication of the photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that journalists cross a dangerous line when they publish photos, etc., of suspects.
The Crown Office, which is in overall control of prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least on charges.
The document will, according to the informant, refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a sustained military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave such a presence for only five years.
Field guards kept close watch on shooters in the supplemental pest control trial, because the trial was monitored and effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sport Shooter Association's hunting program.
According to Mick OFlynn, the NPWS Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage, the four selected shooters for the first-shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provincial Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some due since 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods that overheated were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
METI announced last week that Apple had notified them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
The Cabinet Office responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office stated that no damage was reported in the nation.
The Pacific Warning Center also said that there is no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued and at least six have so far been reported dead.
Six hostages, including kidnappers and elderly people, were released early, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman as she had to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that, if hormones are administered, they will speed up the fetal lung development of the baby.
Xinhua reports that the state investigation team recovered two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
People wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said Luna was the first Queen of the Extremes.
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented that Luna was as strange as I was... maybe even more... loved her and would miss her... hopefully she's in a better place.
Out of the 1,400 previous voters in the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have grown by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the height of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist, had to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was questioned.
He couldn't take the medicine he needed to overcome his pain because it was banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematics and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware or software in early February, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water supply to the earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the earth formed, since comets struck the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as political chatter and foolishness.
People are speculating that he will make an attempt in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FLA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of litres of fuel annually and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controller to pin down the aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transportation is available, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and stop-and-go facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of loss of transportation increased the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors and without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the appearance of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the species has adapted in only two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in all kinds of ways, and it can also be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled out into a thin thread, which can be spun or knitted.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metals, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted books called "illuminated manuscripts".
You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The sap changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (the H in the pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Twist the two dry powders together and then press them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, it will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, and they were connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also used. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were in mixed company.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
This brought us the train, the cart, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey such as rabbits and goats.
Finally, there are many small kittens (including stray pet cats) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, each cat has a special job that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups known as herds.
Lion troops consist of one to three related males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full roar of a lion, but more like a sense of squeaking shouted words.
Little wildcats like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that hunt the wildcat are smaller than they are.
Scientists think that oselotes follow animals and find by smell. They sniff the ground to find out where the animals have been.
They are very good at night vision in the dark, and they also move about unnoticed.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is removed from the main population from which they come (as when they move across a mountain range or a river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily retreat) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
The new environment has different resources and different competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than they previously needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed much, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they began to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot even be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe in, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our homes and make our clothes. Most of the food we eat is plant. Without plants, animals could not live.
Mosasaurus was the top predator in the food chain of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw has more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that there is no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We don't know for sure, but he could have had a tongue, his diet included shells, large fish, mosasaurs, and he could have been a cannibal himself.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not have been able to match it.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own share of strange or unusual feasts involving wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of marsupial known as a hazel mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men preferred to have banquets together where they lay on their sides and ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food brought to Europe from the Americas, or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the deity.
People would sacrifice to the gods, and the priests would try to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner room that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, also enough ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the home was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place in the open air.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were just open counters overlooking the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while travelling further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
IF YOU have seen the movie National Treasure, you may think that there is a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Engraved on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inch by 241⁄2 inch) was rolled up for interference.
So it's possible that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed liberated the north of France, but still the south was not free.
They were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of baking with them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and French forces liberated the south of France and turned on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who work together and live and work as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or like a city, and it also defines the size of society.
City states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture relies on the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a continuing cultural footprint and equitable distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to gain recognition as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government with Congress as its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to enforce taxes, and, with no national executive or judicial branch, they relied on the state authorities, who often did not cooperate, to carry out all their acts.
It also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be changed and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy national football team, along with the German national football team is the second most successful team in the world and was the FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, screen, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the Northern regions, with Italians participating in International Games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an archipelago due to the group of islands that Japan has.
Taiwan began long ago in the 15th century when European sailors sailed past to take the island's name as Ilha Formose, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base southwest of Taiwan, and transformed into indigenous grain production practices by hiring Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
Qing Dynasty (1644 1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been destroyed, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size by the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly the aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (for example the APS family of formats) are equivalent to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often-abused and often-ridiculated rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates movement while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It says that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian faith has united European states despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-pervading power affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary endowment is there specifically for this purpose.
For over a thousand years the central authority of the church was in Rome, and this concentration of power and money led many to question this premise.
Shortly after the outbreak of riots, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has been proven effective; it has cut off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade has broken generally accepted international laws through several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain mined in international waters to prevent any ships from entering large parts of the ocean, which would pose a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominance attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poems, and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period which took place in the 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, there was fierce warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle to occupy the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one monarch.
After the Revolution, professions were also open to male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to pass.
The same is true for the army, as the army ranks are now based on caliber, rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in events beyond this earthly life. He regularly visited a cave known as Hira on the Mountain of Noor for meditation.
The cave itself, which has survived for a long time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, resting atop one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you knew it existed.
Nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of this world can be heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the death of a pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramids were created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The uppercase mark looks like a V and the lowercase mark looks like a crest or a square without its bottom side.
Up means starting at the tip and pushing the bow, and down means starting at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pulling the bow.
An up-beat usually creates a softer sound, while a down-beat is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own points, but remember that the printed lines are there for a musical reason, so they should normally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie Therese and 4 year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to flee back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789, by a mob of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris while they were surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the demonstrators waved the head of a royal who had been killed at Versailles before the terrified Queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They are forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to settle a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds driven through Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits made from the extended exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Temple ministers, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended by convention around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological necessity in the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic coupled with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most disruptions of technological terms share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, produces effects on society that are indigenous, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a countrywide road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass vehicle ownership also leads to road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in health care for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, taken from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the physical environment shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture that were associated with that environment arose, and these things, in harmony with the place of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was counted as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the Crusaders returning with gifts such as silk and spices that were worth more than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
The dress was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Because of the slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag behind by 25 to 30 per year.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time was due to the Crusades, when people began to use knots to tie clothes.
Livestock farming is farming done to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Livestock farming is a simple, often organic system that retains seeds native to the ecoregion combined with rotational cultivation or other relatively easy techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Individuals with similar feelings of neglect by community standards are brought together by subcultures, and allowed to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are characterized by the age, ethnicity, status, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that clearly define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of styles, which include fashions, manners, and informal language use.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by focusing on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, adverse circumstances, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while the children were growing up.
Some wild children have been hooked up by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment has been attributed to parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical limitations.
Feral children may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some have remained on their own in the wilderness.
When a feral child is raised entirely by nonhuman animals, it displays behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost entirely like those of the particular caregiver, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make it easier and more interesting to learn, scaffolding goes a step further.
Ladderwork is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals starting a new learning method, such as a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be either virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little male slider in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Steers are in the software and are intended to question, speed up, and explain procedures to students who would find the process difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, nurturing, and educational, but that is the reality.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Adoption is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and rewards approach.
For example, learning and socializing are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When Eighmey and McCord (1998) examined audience responses to websites, they identified personal involvement and continuing relationships as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is reported that one can tell when a person is lying by correctly interpreting the microexpressions.
In his paper, The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who were unable to understand the speech because of brain damage were nevertheless able to accurately estimate sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior are shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The process of mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation back and forth between the two pools of each generation.
On the savannah, a primate with a digestive system like that of humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid needs with the plants available.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: suppressed growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant sources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high-quality protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their own protein problem in a way similar to how some chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking during your normal sleep period and then falling back asleep for a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you.
If you find yourself setting the clock in your sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids, (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), before bedtime, which forces one to get up so that you can urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates with the amount of tension in a person's body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the vitality present. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been extended by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is activated through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various gods, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a joint enemy in World War II, led by the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war and clashes of system, process and culture that led to the countries falling out.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies were present-day enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought, by standing troops, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman Bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted overnight when 800,000 Soviet Union Red Army soldiers entered and created Belarusian and Ukrainian sea fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the fleet has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Expedition of WWII, in which the Americans attempted to get men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mostly used U-boats, attempted to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might well have been able to conquer Britain as it could the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were commonly kept in herds that roamed the hills and other pastures, and were looked after by goat herders who were multiple children or teenagers, similar to the more common sheep herders.
Wasp tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wasp tracks were mostly made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses they pulled to do so at higher speeds and with greater loads than would have been required to do so on the almost rougher roads of the day.
Cross-beams were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if there was an iron strip on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more finishing of the wooden wheels of the chariots.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first pure iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking, people began walking upright two million years ago with the advent of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, did not normally walk upright.
Two-legged specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to combat future suffering to some extent.
It's like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but whatever it is, if we're not looking for a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem, and we should neutralize it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of mankind's scientific and technological progress, and problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and mankind's excessive lifestyle.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house.
By night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the grounds of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap whips that survive are known to be the oldest copies of the document that still exist.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, to use computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first-aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for the group of insects.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize on humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or house of their host.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research finds that women are twice as likely as men to get MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their baby.
With an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parenting so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works by a scientific method. This method actually accompanies most scientific research.
Although not alone, experimentation, and an experiment in a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and take observations also direct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments that either tagged the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in it to visit natural areas with the aim of enjoying the environment, including plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birding and visitor parks and studies of ecosystem information.
An example is to visit Borneo and learn about and photograph the primate anglerfish.
Every morning, people leave the small villages in carts to go to their workplaces and are passed by others whose workplaces are the area from which they have just moved.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science points out that this massive carbon economy has affected the biosphere's stable conditions that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is involved in the community and uses the transportation system.
In developed lands, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems breed such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport managers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers act within a reasonably consistent range; and thus traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the 3 main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of row level facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back on the body.
This gives them a wider variety of small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the needle-choppers and the day flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believe the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main river is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
New Kingdom ancient Egyptians were amazed by their predecessors' monuments, which were then well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of many working in states where Latin is regularly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, and these can all be found in nature in their basic form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
These were more like the four stages of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had a theory that they could change into new forms changing what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys may also be made that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in that spot at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many when it came out.
Unfortunately, the status and use of the pencil declined as newer writing methods were adopted.
People now text on bill screens, and they don't need to get close to a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's almost like pushing a heavy cart up a hill.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they break apart with little or no stimulus.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the near side and 100 km thick at the far side.
It is thinner under the oceans and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around what motivates or pleases people.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that causes them to want the things they do and the good in their environment that causes them to do or not do certain good.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can emerge when managers start coaching their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to remain one of the men (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, to carry out disciplinary actions, to evaluate employee performance, to assign responsibilities, and to hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person changes into an unrecognizable individual who feels like he or she needs to change everything the team was doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes a break between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams meet at different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a visual team.
The Invisible Team is the management team to which each member reports. The Invisible Team sets the standards there for each member.
Why would an organization go through such a time-consuming process to create a learning organization? One purpose of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and intelligence can come through.
As a result, an organization's processes work together to overcome the hurdle and can lead to a new innovation process to serve the customer's needs.
Leadership must create a culture of creation, as well as shared knowledge and organized study before an organization can be innovative.
Angel (2006) defined the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, so it narrows the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, tears, and tumors affect behavior and, in some cases, alter some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes like never before.
These provide us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models to help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although it has a strong connotation with science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer client diagnoses and questions as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI cystine is now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military units, and is also embedded in various home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of any classroom. A teacher often wants to take her students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual field trips, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a field trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a webcast about their trip to the state capitol, every year the website is redesigned, but old versions are kept online and serve as a sticker.
While students regularly begin their web journal experience with messy language use and spelling, the presence of observers usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the web journal writer begins to pursue improved writing to avoid criticism.
The need to nurture the interest of the crowd inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to take learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings, as well as express their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and contains a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north is the unspoilt natural beauty of the Muskoka and surrounding area.
All these things and more characterize Ontario beyond what outsiders perceive as genuine Canadian.
Large areas farther north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest continent on its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it took hold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it is one that does not look expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences may cause them to feel oppressed, and that it is not uncommon to be pursued, to be held by the arm, and so forth.
Be firm when you turn men away, and do not be afraid to stand up for your rights (Cultural differences or not, they do not make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca, founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting shops to shop in all of Morocco.
To the old Medina it is easy to find places that offer traditional Moroccan goods, such as Moroccan cookware, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole spectrum of extras, but it is also for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the town's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, along with the cheapest mountain gorilla tracks in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu is now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the dangers of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' special PBS program, Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has more of an Arab flair than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeastern part of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily maintenance and entrance fees for the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card that gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the area of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a dazzling column graph accentuated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and travel to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's rural development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that the British colonizers took for themselves and so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and extends 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that falls within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not merely halofite marshes - they include some of the last remaining stands of mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered in water/marsh areas.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted goats in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading in an easterly direction, leave between 06:30 and 07:30 for Jakar/Bumthang.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is suggested that one buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese Coaster Buses, which are reliable and sturdy.
Shared rental cars are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paru (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters and are 378 meters long and have two runways of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical opening under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September of 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most remarkable indigenous group to inhabit the area now known as Eastern Paraguay, and they inhabited the area as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as The Great Province of the Indies, was born as a result of the skirmishes of Spanish conquerors with the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polovelds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP) whose value is equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will be widely accepted throughout the islands and within Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also regularly accepted.
In the remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currencies will be taken; ask the owners in advance what the accepted payment method would be.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is there when winter is in the Northern Hemisphere, and so is winter.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; temperatures of over +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures drop just below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no specific rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the nature is nevertheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, stay at least 100 yards away from bears, wolves, and 25 yards from all other wildlife.
No matter how tame they may appear, buffalo, deer, American elk, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Each year, thousands of visitors are injured because they did not keep proper distance.
Be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying around or cooking scented food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval stand in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British warship was sunk, killing nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the village caused the death of chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland spanning two harbours.
North Coast beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming areas, and most have shade provided by the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Rylaan beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
There are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops at the edge of the beach.
The main local beer is Number One, it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
Many French wines are available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better transported.
The local tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is "espresso", cappuccino is served with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is equal to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and coral reef injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Still, take advice from authorities, obey all notices, and heed safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't really live in the ocean, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have somewhere to relax when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find it impossible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the meetings for you if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents for your destination (e.g. visas).
However, any changes or inquiries should go through the travel agent and not directly through the hotel.
For some music festivals, the largest number of attendees decide to camp on the site, and most view it as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get in early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that while music on the main stages may come to an end, there may be sections of the festival that will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
When crossing the Northern Baltic region in winter, make sure of the hut's location, as it causes a lot of noise for those most affected to pass through the ice.
Saint Petersburg boat trips include time in town. Ride passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the money spent by guests. Windows and bells are usually absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
To keep up with their point of view and to keep guests in a good mood, they usually have special offers on food, drink, and entertainment.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness affects your judgment, and all good gamblers realize the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive over mountain passes at high latitudes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or subfreezing temperatures.
Friction on icy and snowy roads is very low, and you cannot drive as if you were on a bare tar road.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall quickly in a short time to prevent you from fasting.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or wind-borne snow or by condensation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many lands, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari, as it is popularly used, refers to overland travel to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on savannahs.
Some animals, such as elephants and camel horses, tend to get too close to carts and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, leopards, and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a forest walk, walking safari, or walking walk) consists of a walk of several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be hosted in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until June 2020 for when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000 with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have a stitch and ironing board available to borrow even if there is none in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not like wearing ironing socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the material (otherwise it may shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal diseases unknown in their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people violently, do not usually qualify as pests.
Customs-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods, exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, where it frequently passes through abandoned inland terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your distance: steep gradients, narrow lanes, and steep curves prevail.
Speed limits are markedly lower than in previous and subsequent sections  usually 35-40mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Oddly enough, the cell phone service here is better than many other parts of the route, e.g., the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are also delicious, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit pies are common, with apples baked in pies year-round, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer months.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often paired well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want small but rich doughnuts, try what, depending on the region, are called the Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either dry or wet, depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is common in curries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that includes a wide variety of local dishes from around the nation.
However, when used with further qualifiers, the term tends to mean food originally from central and eastern parts of mainland Java.
Javanese food now freely available across the archipelago is characterized by simply flavored dishes, the prominent flavoring for Javanese food being peanuts, raisins, sugar (specifically Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The handrails are for supporting the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but may pose safety risks due to the possibility of the rider's feet becoming stuck in them.
If a horse drops the rider and his foot gets stuck in the stirrup, he can be dragged along as the horse runs away. To reduce the risk, there are several safety measures that can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a saddle's belt to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and rocks.
Mountain peaks offer breathtaking views of peaks, and climbers from around the world are constantly searching for new routes between the endless rock faces.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skis or a snowboard strapped to one's feet to slide down a snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski boomer", planning entire vacations to ski at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings dating back as far as 5,000 B.C.E. depict skiers!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski tours: This activity may also be called indoor skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but does not include, alpine ski style tours or mountain climbing, the latter of which are done on steep terrain and require stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will cover somewhat greater distances than by walking  but only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without  a heavy backpack in neat tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries, and under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would have meant going through multiple visa applications and passport control points.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control checkpoints again.
By having a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for each Schengen member country separately, saving you time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes antique or manufactured items. Some tax agencies define antiques as goods that are more than 100 years old.
