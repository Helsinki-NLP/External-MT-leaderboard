Members of the Welsh Assembly are afraid of looking like fools.
Some members of the National Assembly were intimidated by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament  Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal was made in connection with plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from various political parties fear that this could bring ridicule.
One Labour MP said his party was concerned that rhyme with twp and pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means fool and pwp means poop.
A Welsh party MP said the party as a whole was "dissatisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative MP said his party was moving towards changing the name to liberal, but noted that it was not far from the abbreviation MWP to muppet (doll, fool).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u.
The Assembly's committee is currently working on a bill to change the names of the members of the Assembly, which stated: The final decision on the possible designation of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be the responsibility of the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the National Assembly for Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public discussion on the proposals, which showed that the change of name to the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
As regards the designation of the Assembly's Members, the Commission preferred the name Members of the Welsh Parliament (WMP), but the MWP option received the greatest support in the public debate.
The Assembly's members are obviously trying to propose alternative options, but the problem may be reaching an agreement, especially for Speaker Elin Jones, who is due to table a bill on the amendments in a few weeks.
The reform laws will also include further changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the exclusion of Members and the drafting of the committee system.
The deputies of the Assembly will have the final say on the question of their designation when they debate the laws.
Macedonians go to the polls for a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Greece has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor expresses a claim to Greek territory and has therefore repeatedly objected to the country's EU and NATO membership applications.
Macedonia's president, Djorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a price the country must pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's have gone off in Harlem because of the church problems.
"The old people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner", says Adams.
Today, there's neither one nor the other.
In his view, the decline in bars is understandable.
"People today socialize differently", he says.
The bar is no longer a living room where people from the neighborhood meet regularly.
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, and that sooner or later they will be back to square one.
He further said that churches could be supplanted by rental housing, with residential areas filled with people who would not support the remaining churches in the vicinity.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he says. "The day is approaching when these churches will close completely because it is unlikely that most people coming to these neighborhoods will belong to these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930's.
The building was claimed by a black congregation that held worship services nearby.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was a central figure in the boycott of retailers on 125th Street (Harlem's main shopping street) who refused to hire and support blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners had this bell made as part of plans to restore the church.
The Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called this bell the "Bells of the Poor".
A specialist who played outside in July called it "cultural treasure" and "irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert is Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, who also noted that it was the world's first bell, played by a black musician  Dionisio A. Lind, who began playing on a larger bell 18 years ago at Riverside Church.
Merriweather says no one at St. Martin's replaced him.
Over the past few months, St. Martin's has been the site of a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by secular church leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish administration, which is made up of secular leaders and runs the lighthouse, wrote to the diocese in July that it was concerned that the diocese would "refrain from paying the costs" of the parish administration, despite the fact that the parish administration had not participated in hiring the architects and suppliers sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency regarding the diocese's operations.
A 13-year-old boy who was hunting lobster in California was injured by a shark
Authorities say a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark Saturday while hunting lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack happened shortly before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends were diving for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was excited to catch a lobster, but then he found out that the boy was screaming, "Something bit me!"
Something bit me!
He had a completely torn collarbone, Hammel said, which was the first thing he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles said at a briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to the Swami's area in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security reasons.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to invest in the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's wants to create a cosmetics aisle in the style of a department store to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
This is a major £2.8 billion investment in the UK cosmetics market, which is growing steadily while sales in the fashion and home goods sectors are falling. e investment will test larger cosmetics aisles in 11 stores across the country. If successful, more stores will be added in the following year.
The investment in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill shelf space once occupied by TVs, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetics range to 3,000 products, with brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw available for the first time.
The existing product lines of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space, as there will be branded spaces, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also relaunched its Boutique make-up line to make most products available to vegans, as younger customers increasingly demand it.
The fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will also be testing concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, South London and the second opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the trend of buying small amounts of food every day in local stores with a variety of goods mean that supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that stores will increasingly resemble department stores. His supermarket chain is trying to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos stores into hundreds of stores and also integrated several Habitat stores, both of which were bought by the company two years ago.
The supermarket's previous attempt to innovate its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with the Boots chain after 2000, but the merger ended a dispute concerning the distribution of revenues from pharmacies in its supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of Sainsbury's's pharmaceutical business, which had 281 stores, to Celesio three years ago, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain and had a £125m sale value.
The company stated that the Lloyds chain would play an important role as a wider range of premium skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, would be added to the four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and style of the cosmetics aisles to make our customers shop in a more comfortable environment.
In addition, we have invested in special training for colleagues who will be on hand and ready to help.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all requirements.An impressive environment and practical locations mean that we have become a major destination in the cosmetics sector, which is an innovation of traditional shopping.
Peter Jones is furious that Holly Willoughby has terminated her £11 million contract.
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones has been furious that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has terminated an £11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their Trula brand of home accessories and accessories.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of This Morning (37) announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons' Den star Peter Jones by pulling out of a lucrative lifestyle brand joint venture at the last minute to focus on her own new mega-deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was furious when the TV hottie, during a nervous Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that new contracts worth up to £1.5 million meant he would no longer have enough time to focus on their Trula home accessories brand.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew out of Britain and headed to one of her holiday resorts.
One source said: "The Truly Project was clearly Holly's number one priority.
It was to be her long-term future, securing her for decades to come.
Her decision to leave was a complete shock to everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one knew what was going on.
The warehouse at the Marlow headquarters is full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions, due to huge investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home accessories, but also the possibility of further delays in the market.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby proposed the Trula project with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, became director in March.
The two couples spend vacations together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S, replacing Ant McPartlin, who hosts ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not be commenting on business matters".
It was a tough conversation, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he's facing from the media for his remark, which some will consider "unpresidentially unsuitable" and blame him for making such a positive comment about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump sacrifice so much?
Trump responded with his ridiculous moderating vote.
I didn't sacrifice anything at all.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after an initial joint meeting in Singapore in June, and Trump hailed the first meeting as a big step toward eliminating North Korea's nuclear weapons.
But negotiations to eliminate nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Jong-il told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see an "adequate response" from the US to North Korea's first steps toward disarmament.
He noted that the US continued to apply sanctions instead to increase pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to the rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were in danger of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have this great relationship now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results: an end to missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of remaining American troops home.
He also defended the unusual way he talks about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to talk like a president, but then you wouldn't have 10,000 people standing outside trying to get in, you'd have 200 people standing in there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes devastated an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs learned that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's inhabitants were forced to flee their homes, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for international assistance.
In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is a bit complicated, said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pala, it is not yet certain whether foreign workers will be able to work in the field.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to participate in relief efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes Indonesia faces, the country's preparedness for the wrath of nature is deplorable.
Although tsunami shelters are in place in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Pala, despite an active warning, likely contributed to the high death toll.
Even under favorable conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was on Lombok to provide care for earthquake victims is headed to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo built his election campaign on improving Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure, spending generously on roads and railways.
However, Widodo's administration is facing a lack of funds and is facing another election next year.
Widodo also faces pressure from the ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, where followers of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands more were displaced during the street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other crude weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool FC from a distance equalises against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was given a free kick by Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 yards from Chelsea's goal, his team being down 1-0 at the time.
He threw the ball to the left and sent a shot to the farther away goal.
His attempt was hovering high above the penalty area and heading for the top right corner of the gate.
The ball finally fell through the struggling Kepa Arrizabalaga into the net.
"I was just trying to get in that position, to get to the ball, because players like Shaq always try to play as far forward as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching, I made one touch, I didn't think much about it and I fired.
Chelsea led 1-0 in the second half, but were replaced by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward before this goal five returned the play to Matej Kovacic, turned in the middle of the field and sprinted to half Liverpool.
Kovacic showed a quick shot in the middle of the field.
Then he sent a beautiful penalty kick that went into the penalty area with Hazard.
Hazard overtook the defenders and finished on the far side of the bar when he passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker with a left-handed shot.
Liverpool are looking forward to a Champions League group stage match against Napoli, starting at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will be playing Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday from 15:00 in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency reported early Sunday morning.
Reports say many people are trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit on Friday, causing waves up to 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was filled with rubble.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a woman who was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street.
Police are encouraging people in the area who have seen or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I urge anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has anything recorded on the onboard camera to contact us, as they may have key information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside the property.
Friends of the woman who believe they know her came to the scene this afternoon to find out where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway and police say they are currently notifying the victim's family.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but the police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to say anything.
The owners of the apartments now know that they will be able to get back inside in a few hours.
One of the officers was heard telling another man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, crying.
He keeps saying, "It's so awful".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the cordon, another van was parked outside.
There were several police officers in the cordon, watching the panel house.
Police are asking anyone with information to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers Unit at 0800 555 111 with reference to protocol 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in front of Parliament is the latest monument to be the subject of a dispute over "rewrite history".
Removing it would be a satisfaction for his fanatical Puritan followers like the Taliban who destroyed so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts.
However, Cromwell's company called Crick's proposal "a mistake" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was obvious that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the targets.
Cromwell neither ordered nor executed the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Ham Thornycroft's magnificent realisation of Cromwell is a testament to his 19th century perception and is part of the history of a personality many still consider worthy of reverence.
Goldsmith wrote for The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many as perhaps more of a protector of Parliament from outside forces, in his case of course the protector of the monarchy, than he was at the end of the 19th century.
Whether this is a completely accurate description of the facts is still debated by historians.
But what is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique figure who embodies one side of that dispute.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and respect.
A dying pig crushed a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a farmer in a market in southeastern China was attacked and killed by a pig.
A man identified only by the surname Jüan was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a barn in a market in Liou-pchan-shue prefecture in Kuechou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares a vaccine at a pig farm in Si-ning Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China, May 30, 2005.
On Wednesday, he allegedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at a market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the next barn open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, a court investigation confirmed that the 250-pound duck had beaten the farmer to death.
"The nephew had bloody and crushed legs", said a cousin nicknamed Wu, quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
According to security camera footage, Jüan went to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Juan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was separated from others to prevent it from attacking another person while police gathered evidence on the scene.
Jüan's family and market representatives are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although pig attacks on humans are rare, they have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 150-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer to the tractor until his wife could scare the animal away.
After a 2012 case of pigs eating an Oregon farmer, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the bloodlust can act as a "trigger".
They're just playing.
Shantia, they're curious... they don't mean to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the proper respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain in many parts of the southwestern United States
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, the Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa reached winds of 85 miles per hour [137 km/ hr] at 5:00 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, a Category 1 hurricane located 400 miles [620 km] southwest of the Mexican outlet of Punta Eugenia.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring more than 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Tropical moisture then combined with the approaching trough will create extensive and heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
In some places, 2 to 10 centimeters of precipitation will fall, causing dangerous flash floods, debris flooding, and possible desert landslides.
Deep tropical moisture will produce rains with a point to point drop of 5 to 8 millimeters an hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona, two to three inches [5-10 cm] of precipitation is expected.
Severe flooding can occur because conditions are rapidly deteriorating, due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
In view of the threat of tropical rain, it would be extremely unwise to go into the desert on foot.
Heavy rain can cause rivers to rage in the canyons, with storms bringing strong winds and dust in the air.
The approaching trough in some parts of the Southern California coast will cause heavy local rain.
More than 13 millimetres of precipitation may fall, which could cause debris to float and slippery roads to a lesser extent.
It would be the first rain in the area during its rainy season.
Scattered rain showers will begin to move into Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, and rain will spread Monday night and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners states on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
Temperatures can fluctuate dramatically throughout the United States in October, with the Arctic cooling while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to abrupt temperature changes at short distances.
A great example of a sharp change in temperature is in the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 11 degrees.
Over the next few days, it will again attempt to re-plant and spread the lingering summer heat.
In many parts of the central and eastern United States, warm early October is expected, with temperatures in several areas from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast reaching over 85 degrees Fahrenheit [26°C].
In New York City, it could be 26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States throughout the first half of October.
The Brett Kavanaugh hearing was watched by over 20 million people.
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's dramatic testimony on six television networks from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting Christine Blasey-Ford in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, and it wasn't until Friday that radio and television stations interrupted their broadcasts for a last-minute twist: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake secured a deal that allows the FBI to investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had been groping her while she was in a tense state and trying to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, who testified passionately, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
The broadcast was likely watched by more than 20.4 million viewers, as announced by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For the other networks that broadcast the broadcast, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring viewership in offices.
For comparison  similar viewership to a football playoff game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-making presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, averaged 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearing, according to Nielsen, the highest of any network.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was high after the hearing.
The main character of Friday's drama was Flake.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being shouted at by protesters as he tried to get into the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
For a few minutes, he stood with his eyes down and listened to the remorse broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one of the women.
Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
And one said to him, Thou hast great power, and there are many women that are powerless.
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before the elevator closed, he said he'd say more at the committee hearing.
All cable and other networks were still reporting the matter live hours later, as the Judiciary Committee was scheduled to vote on whether to send Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigates the allegations against the nominee within the next week, as the Democratic minority has been urging.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who is his friend.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had a lot of power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of playing political games over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticize her decision to leave the European Union of playing political games with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which is on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, attacked her Brexit plan, which is being compared to a game of checkers, saying that the proposal for Britain and the EU to levy tariffs on each other is completely absurd.
Police arrested Dyton Simpson as a suspect in the death of an LSU quarterback .
Police have arrested a suspect in the alleged shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he had confessed to shooting Sims.
According to the lawyer's information, his bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their "effort and commitment to justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-8 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where he and his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked and devastated" by Sims' death.
"You're always worried about this", Wade said.
A volcano spews ash on Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans to avoid the volcano on Saturday after activity increased in the crater, recording 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre has recorded several reports of noise and tremors.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windows of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, after a magnitude-7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with law enforcement, and thousands more took part in parallel demonstrations marking the first anniversary of a Catalan vote to secede that has divided society.
A group of masked separatists were stopped by law enforcement officers, throwing eggs and powdered paint, leaving streets that are normally crowded with tourists covered in dark clouds of dust.
Later in the day, police used batons to bring the rioters under control.
For several hours, a group of pro-independence protesters chanting "We will not forget, we will not forgive" faced unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
According to local press reports, 14 people have been treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tensions remain high in the region, which is seeking independence a year after Madrid declared an October 1 referendum illegal, but Catalan separatists have been celebrating.
The vast majority of voters chose independence, but turnout was low because opponents of secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police in violent clashes tried to prevent the continuation of voting in polling stations across the region.
Independence groups camped outdoors Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it had to go in a different direction.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer believed Catalonia would achieve independence.
Last year was one of our best years.
My parents were crying because they were happy to vote, but now we're stuck, she says.
Although the Catalan political parties calling for independence won a narrow (but important) victory in regional elections last December, they are failing to succeed this year, with many of their most prominent leaders themselves in exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a police-supported protest by telephone, says politicians on both sides contributed to the conflict.
"The situation is getting more tense", he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in jail awaiting trial since late last year, announced on Saturday that he will run in next year's European Parliament elections.
Candidating in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and repression shown by the Spanish government, he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for crashing into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30pm UK time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
Besides, there could have been a drive-by shooting.
Meng's goal was a 1-0 win for Livingston over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensures victory
Newcomer Livingston has shocked Rangers, bringing Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games since taking over as Ibrox manager.
Dolly Meng's performance proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team was able to reach the second Hibernian.
Gerrard's side are still unbeaten in the Premier League this season and next Sunday they will face Hearts, who are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna to the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extended his unbeaten streak to six games, and head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, still hasn't tasted the bitterness of defeat.
Livingston was burning the odds against the screaming guests.
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the goal, but his directness was a problem for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made it through, but his attempt went through the gate, and Alan Lithgow's finish was then just off the mark as he slid to Craig Halkett's head in front of the gate.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, because they knew they could cause problems for the visitors from standard situations.
And that's exactly how the decisive goal was scored.
Against the Rangers, a free kick was in play and Livingston managed to break through, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to find Meng and he scored from the middle of the penalty area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession, but were unable to overcome home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was out of work most of the time.
And that went on until the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman's attempt to stop Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's legs and Lithgow ended another standard situation for Livingston next.
Livingston's centre-halves were constantly targeted and defence was constantly deflecting them, and the players had twice requested penalties after Halkett's intervention on alternate Glenn Middleton and the referee allowed the game to continue after the alleged hand.
The phenomenal Livingston analysis of the
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a result for Livingston.
All the players as one man have been exceptional, and they continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
The style of play and the players on the team have hardly changed since returning to the top flight, but Holt deserves a lot of credit for how he has lifted the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was incredible, running a perfectly organized defense while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall breathless throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Under Gerrard, they played very well on several occasions, but they were far from that level.
They missed the final play  only got to the home defense once  and for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, it's a raised warning finger.
Erdogan was not only given a warm welcome in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), the leaders of Turkey and Germany had a breakfast together in Berlin and the mood was excellent.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
The dispute arose from problems related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turks outside Turkey.
Police said they prevented a group of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many followers who wanted to see their president showed up nearby.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents (many of them Kurds) also came forward, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
The counter-protests show a difference of opinion about this guest, with some German Turks hailing him as a hero, while others denouncing him as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed after collision with car
A cyclist has been killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city.
The driver stopped the car and paramedics arrived, but the cyclist died of his injuries.
The accident occurred just months after another cyclist was killed by a hit-and-run driver on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform relatives.
The road is closed, bus traffic diverted and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in the riot
Six prison guards were injured during riots at a high-security men's prison, according to the prison's press release.
The riots broke out at around 9:30 a.m. British summer time Sunday at the Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire, and they are still continuing.
Tornado Special Forces have been called in to bring the riots under control, and eight prisoners have been brought in to manage the riot.
The guards were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison authority spokesman said: "We have deployed a specially trained prison unit to address an ongoing incident at the British prison of Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in prisons and we want to make it clear that we will hand those responsible over to the police and they can stay behind bars longer.
Long Lartin is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, a report emerged that the warden had been hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, a riot squad was called into the prison to put an end to a major riot when inmates attacked guards with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens severe flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (drought-affected areas may benefit)
The Arizona Tropical Depression is an exceptional event, but it's likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa moves through the desert southwest, bringing with it the risk of severe flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flash flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for an area from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain forecast late Monday night.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have been classified as tropical storms or low pressure since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models forecast two to three inches [5-10 cm] of precipitation, with up to six inches [15 cm] in some places in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, 25 to 50 millimeters are likely to fall, with exceptions of up to 100 millimeters.
In areas where there is no risk of flooding, the dew-induced rain can be useful because the area is plagued by drought.
While the flooding is a cause for concern, this rain is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing a dry season.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is currently facing at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
On land, Hurricane Rosa will first make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour [137 km/ hr] on Sunday morning, is 400 miles [620 km] south of the Punta Eugenia outlet in Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour [19 km/ hr].
The storm has hit the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, and it's losing its intensity.
So it is expected to reach the Mexican mainland as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The amount of rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be heavy, meaning a high risk of flooding.
 Between Baja California and northwestern Sonora, rainfall totals 75 to 150 millimeters, with some areas reaching as high as 250 millimeters, weather.com reports.
Rosa will then continue as a tropical storm through Mexico northward until it reaches the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest threat posed by Rosa or its remnants is a very high amount of precipitation in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening tidal floods and desert debris flooding, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three boys aged 17 to 18 and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of the attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at approximately 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area overnight, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police are asking anyone who recorded the incident on their cell phone to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered the wrath and the indignation of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's reckless and vile tactics", Trump said before a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered the wrath and the malice of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally rejecting Christine Blasey-Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in connection with the allegation at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that the American people had the opportunity to see the uniqueness, character and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most respected legal experts today and a lawyer with an excellent record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
There are five weeks left until the election, which is one of the most important in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running, he said.
That's why I'm doing my best to support exceptional candidates.
Trump has said the goal of the Democrats is to "resist and hinder".
The first key procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be on the agenda by Friday, a senior Republican Party official told CNN.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami claim hundreds dead, death toll rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed up on the beaches as huge waves caused by a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathering at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to 20 feet [6 m] high hit the shore in the evening, destroying everything in their path and saving many lives.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach, they didn't run away and they became victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it took away cars, trams, houses, hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at 800 km/h in the open sea before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, hidden and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued in this coastal city on Saturday.
Several earthquakes were recorded in the area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The agency reported that the tsunami's intensity may have been increased by the city's location at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, businesses and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the loss of life and damage could be greater in Donggala, which is located 300 kilometers along the coast north of Palu, because the area is closer to the epicenter.
Communication was completely paralyzed and no information was available from Donggala, Nugroho said.
'More than 300,000 people live there,' the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
'It's a tragedy already, but it could be much worse,' he declared.
The agency faced widespread criticism on Saturday for failing to report on the tsunami in Palau, but authorities said the waves arrived at a time when warnings had already been issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building, shouting desperate warnings of an approaching tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the coast, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications with the city of Palu and the surrounding area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
Officials said the army had begun sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities to the scene with aid, but evacuees continued to be in urgent need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport has been reopened to aircraft with assistance only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision workers from Donggala made it safely to the city of Palu, where they are hiding in canvas shelters built in the backyard of the office, they passed through devastated areas, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses", he says.
The situation is very bad.
When relief groups took on the daunting task of rebuilding after the disaster, some complained that experienced foreign aid workers were not allowed to travel to Palus.
Under Indonesian regulations, the flow of funds, supplies and workers from other countries can only begin if a disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
It is still a provincial-level disaster, said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Only when the government declares a national disaster can we open the door to international aid.
As the second night in Palu came after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the families and friends of the missing persisted in hoping that their loved ones would be the miracle in the grim story of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped for two days in the rubble with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, was training two missing paragliders at the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Some of those who were imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
"Since I've been paragliding for so long, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Subandono described how, hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse had swept the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu who were attending the beach festival.
However, his messages only showed one gray check mark instead of two blue ones.
"I think it means the messages weren't delivered", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 from a cash machine in the Newport on the Levee area.
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling an ATM in the Newport on the Levee area Friday morning, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at this entertainment complex and was about to deposit more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy reported.
While he was busy, another man ran from behind a Brink's employee and stole bags of money intended for deposit.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not disclose the number of perpetrators involved in the incident.
If you have any information regarding their identity, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The entity officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known as Ye for a long time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live to promote his new album Yandhi.
She's replacing Ariana Grande, who pulled out of the show for "emotional reasons", according to the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West has stated in the past that the word has religious meaning to him.
I think the word "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you", West said this year, when he was talking about the title of his album with a radio host, Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The word Kanye, which means "unique", is derived from the word Ye, which reflects the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's just another one of the famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former associate, Jay-Z, also introduces himself with and without a connector and in upper and lower case.
The Mexican president has solemnly promised not to use the military against civilians
Newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never, under any circumstances, use the military to defeat the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on peaceful protesters in this square, killing up to 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were gaining ground throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans with monthly student grants and the opening of more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are causing young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its spending on AI research, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI promoter who has worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These statements come after various US government bodies have spoken out on AI, although the US does not have a general formal strategy on AI.
On the contrary, China unveiled its plan last year: to be the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"As all other countries are far behind the US and we are trying to make another breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI), doubling the AI budget would be a good start", Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances of our next big break in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this week by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat the top-rated American player named Othello, and later was an executive at Microsoft Research and the CEO of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee was responding to previous US state technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotic Challenge and asked when the next one would be held to help uncover future visionaries.
As Lee said, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"It's not China that is taking our academic leaders away, it's big corporations", Lee added.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring the best minds from universities to work on AI for them in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help support the US in AI.
I think that PhD holders in AI should be automatically offered a green card, he said.
The State Committee of China issued its next-generation AI Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government organizations distributing money to American scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee says.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which intends to engage partners from industry and academia.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
In contrast, the U.S. legislation that sought to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been acted upon for months.
Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to Republic of North Macedonia. The move would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's bids for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments drew up an agreement in June that included the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic-majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether turnout will reach the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: Are you in favour of membership of the European Union and NATO through recognition of the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, a country that was created after the fall of Yugoslavia, to join communities such as the EU and NATO.
I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will respect the will of the electorate and decide on the outcome.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission has declared that there were no irregularities in the referendum as of 13:00.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their ballots in a Macedonian referendum on changing the country's name to allow it to join NATO and the European Union, in the Macedonian city of Strumica on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and pulled chairs out of tents set up by opponents who wanted to boycott the referendum.
We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads held high, not the back door, said Kavadarkov.
"We may be a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He added that the resulting 'Yes' would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters are preparing for the referendum  which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV station Telma found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those polled, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure to hold a referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it came to power in May last year.
Look, Sergio Aguero of Manchester City beats the whole Brighton defence and scores a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, smashed Brighton's defence and secured a 2-0 win for Manchester City.
Aguer's elegant goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy at first glance.
The Argentine striker took the centre of the field for a late start.
He slid between three Brighton defenders and ran into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He pushed past one defender and then went around a few others on the edge of the Brighton block.
He sent a left-handed pass to Sterling.
The English striker made his first touch and sent it back to Aguero, who passed Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a right-handed shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguera has some foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about it playing for about 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave City a first-half lead in the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton territory in this game.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a couple of times and led Sterling to a far-off goal.
Cityzens' forward hit the net just before it slid into the car.
City are set to face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German city of Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the Rockies' chances.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there wasn't much reason to push for another start.
But the fiercely competitive Scherzer is hoping to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, if only it still has the potential to have consequences for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
With a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies have at least maintained their wild card spot, but they still have to claim their first division title.
Even if we're not playing for nothing, at least we can still get on the field with the thought that with the atmosphere here in Denver and with this crowd and this opponent, this is probably the highest level we're going to get this year.
Of course I want to experience it.
The Nationals haven't named a starting pitcher for Sunday, but it looks like they're gonna let Scherzer pitch.
Scherzer, who would have been 34th, would have been in the bullpen on Thursday and would have pitched on Sunday, his usual day off.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterms.
In November, everything we've achieved will be at stake.
We're five weeks away from the most important decision of our lives.
It's a huge, huge opportunity, and even though I'm not running, I'm running, so I'm going up and down the country and fighting for our great candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, really terrible radical group of Democrats.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary, mean and malicious.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to gain power and control.
The Democrats, he said, were on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
"You've seen it in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, mean, evil and liars".
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee, specifically Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which was met with loud applause from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
You leaked that document?
Um, um, what?
No, um, no, I, wait... her body language was really bad... the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is not being liberal anymore.
They don't tolerate those who express their opinion
When the Momentum activists voted to reprimand me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who have been told they are no longer welcome  and all for expressing an opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the rebuke was criticizing me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
It was about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically, actually, on similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The invitation to the Labour meeting outside Nottingham on Friday said we wanted the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings today are not in that tone, and the promise of a more generous, gentler policy is long forgotten, if it ever was.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each view is judged on its acceptability to the leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy took over because colleagues who I had previously thought shared a similar political stance suddenly expected me to turn around and take views that I would never have otherwise agreed with  whether on national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak publicly, and it's basically the same thing I say, there's a barrage of criticism on social media, calling for a recall, giving up politics on Wednesday, and I listen like I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me tend to be purely political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist attacks every day and never hide from it.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political era is how much the level of attacks has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer the famous liberals, and with every call for a vote of no confidence or a change in the selection rules, the party is getting smaller.
For the past two years, I've had a lot of people tell me to stay out of the crowd, be quiet and keep up, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, provoked by the Thatcher government's indifference, which allowed my high school classroom to literally collapse, I have tried to push for better public services for those who needed it most  whether in the local council or the ministry.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused by my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I would only say that as the country slips into a Brexit that will hurt our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on resolving my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not from the Momentum initiative in Nottingham, it's to the people of my constituency, whether they're Labour or not: I'm proud to have served you and I promise you that no threat of impeachment or political accountability will deter me from trying to push what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr undefeated, Ayr on top.
Two late attempts may have slightly undermined the final result, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved a triumph in this amazingly engaging match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They found themselves at the top of the table as the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, they brought home a victory with a great defense and a better use of chances, and Coach Peter Murchie has every right to be happy.
"We've had a lot of tests during the games and we're undefeated, so I have to be happy", he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Hat off to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did".
With a 14th-minute shot by Grant Anderson that converted Frazier Climo, Ayr took the lead, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to overtake and Jason Baggot scored an unchanged try.
Climo took the lead with Ayr's penalty kick and then, right in the half, scored a solo attempt to allow Ayr to go into the break with a 17-5 score.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's shot, converted by Baggot, cut the gap to five points.
This was followed by a prolonged delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was sidelined, and as soon as the game started to resume, Ayr got further into the lead with a try from Stafford McDowall, who turned Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of that in the form of an unchanged attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of a highly-pressured encounter.
However, the home side re-surfaced and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for hitting Clima without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown from a penalty shoot-out with Ayr's approaching horde on his back.
The climate changed, just like it did almost at the start of the action, after Kyle Rowe caught a box kick from David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's wing away on the fifth try of the home run.
The star of the show Still Game is embarking on a new career in gastronomy .
The star of the British series Still Game, Ford Kieran, is apparently embarking on a career in the service industry, and according to our information, he has been named CEO of a company with a restaurant license.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC programme, which he writes and stars in alongside his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be their last, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning a life outside the Glasgow suburb of Craiglang.
According to official records, he's a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source told the Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "thriving restaurant business" in Glasgow.
The sea is ours: Bolivia, cut off from the sea, hopes to regain access to the Pacific
Sailors surround the naval headquarters in La Paz wearing sails.
They fly bright blue flags on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are emblazoned with the motto: "The sea is our right".
It's our duty to get him back.
Across Bolivia, cut off from the sea, the memory of the coastlines lost to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still alive  as is the desire to re-paddle the waters of the Pacific Ocean.
Now, perhaps the most hopeful time in decades, Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of trial.
Bolivia is on the rise, has a spirit of unity and balance and of course believes in a positive outcome, said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the international court on big screens across the country in the hope that the Hague tribunal will rule in Bolivia's favor, so that after decades of stalled negotiations, Chile will be obliged to negotiate for sovereign access to the Bolivian sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president who will be in contentious re-election bids next year, also has a say in Monday's decision.
"Our return to the Pacific is within reach", he declared in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court's decision in favor of Bolivia is unlikely  and that even if it did, little would change.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to assign Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ruling by the international court comes only six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And while Bolivia's arguments are not in doubt, it may have taken a step backward in recent years.
'The issue of access to the sea has been appropriated by the current Bolivian government,' said Zarate.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has undermined all remaining Chilean friendliness, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will one day continue negotiations, but after that it will be very difficult to maintain a dialogue.
The countries have not had ambassadorial representation from each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision would be unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia a 'great opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of disagreement and achieve mutual benefits', he said.
Calzadilla also rejected the claim that Morales  still one of Latin America's most popular presidents  uses the maritime issue as a political gimmick.
'Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,' he added.
Decisions are an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.
North Korea will refuse to denuclearize until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will not be the first to get rid of its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit between rival leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of resuming diplomatic talks on the nuclear issue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un more than three months after Singapore.
Ri says it's an illusion to think that the continued US sanctions and protests against the declaration that would end the Korean War could bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant steps toward disarmament.
Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up its arsenal, which the country most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for the second Kim Jong Un-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows feature the latest trends in impressive headgear that you will soon find in your store
If you want to expand your collection of hats or to protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled their Spring/Summer 19 collection at the pier, featuring a range of unusual oversized headgear that stunned audiences at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their shocking creations to the showcase pier.
A unique piece from Valentino was a bulky beige hat adorned with a paper top that covered the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included a gem-lined melon, a witch's hat, and even pineapples - but these are not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also showed off a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature resembled a scuba diver's gear, including a snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you like bold fashion expressions, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predict that giant hats will make their way into your local convenience store.
The oversized hats follow the inspiration of La Bomba, the two-inch-wide straw hat that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowska wore.
The iconic brand behind the highly impractical hat that lurked around every social media corner sent another large creation to the pier  a straw beach bag almost the size of the model in a bathing suit that is wearing it.
A bright orange raffia bag, framed with raffia straps and complete with a white leather ear, was the unique piece of the La Riviera Spring/Summer 19 collection from Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to hit mainstream stores next summer. With the designer having such a huge influence, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Without language skills, a global citizen is not a failure
Scottish independent schools maintain excellent academic performance and this trend continues in 2018 with another year of exceptional test scores, further enhancing individual and collective achievements in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30 000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further and higher education, careers of their choosing and a place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement tailored curricula, we still see modern languages as a popular and sought-after elective in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you speak to a man in a language he understands, you are speaking to his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you speak to his heart.
It is a powerful reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely on English alone.
We see from this year's test results that language is at the top of the table with the highest average marks among independent schools.
Overall, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest A's.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved the highest A's in Mandarin Chinese, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as a basic skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered as an elective subject in independent schools and other schools as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that among the reasons employers cited for problems filling jobs, 17 per cent were poor language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more promising jobs emerge that require languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career a person chooses, learning a second language will have a real future benefit from such a lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent could not speak any foreign language well enough to be able to converse fluently, with French being the only language where the number of people reached double-digit percentages (15 percent).
That is why it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will vary according to the languages taught.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for the UK in terms of future in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, independent schools will always have a variety of languages to choose from and will be taught by experts in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
Today, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages remain fundamentally important for the future of a country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be called international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's got to be done.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron is set to debut in San Diego on Sunday .
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James' first game for the Los Angeles Lakers will be waiting a while.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be making his debut Sunday in the opening preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet decided how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James spoke about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage in my career, I don't need to start a pre-season game", he said.
Trump rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump began a series of rallies today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's planned rallies for next week, including stops at related sites, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
After the vote for his nominee for the vacant Supreme Court seat was withheld, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia today and where can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is at 7:00 PM Eastern time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on the current hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has been strained by sexual harassment allegations, with the expected Senate confirmation vote postponed for a week while the FBI investigations continue.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans, who face a tough November election, regain their momentum.
So, according to Reuters, these five rallies next week are all about "building up volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to preserve and expand their majority in the Senate and House".
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that as he enters the busy election season, the president will travel to as many states as possible", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, declining to be named.
Today's rally, taking place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw media attention from Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News reports.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in the last month, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to back the Republican candidate for the Senate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, whose preferences are falling behind in the polls.
"For Morrissey, it's not a good sign that the president has to come to elevate his preferences in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage in the fight and hopes to win entry into Sunday's singles
After three one-sided series, Saturday afternoon foursome may be just what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swinging pendulum is a fictional sporting concept, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions of this type.
So, which side do they think the motive force is on now?
"They were six points ahead, now it's only four, so we can say we have a bit of momentum now", said Jordan Spieth as he prepared for his race day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, a four-point lead and 12 more in play.
However, as Spieth says, the Americans feel a gentle breeze in their sails and have plenty of reason to hope, thanks in part to the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was unbeatable from the first to the last hole, leading by example.
As his round progressed, the throaty cheers grew louder, sinking a key putt and the fourth match was tied, with him and Thomas two to two behind.
He celebrated his putt, which won the match at 15, with a similar cry, proving his belief that the American team is not yet lost in the competition.
"You just have to roll up your sleeves and get on with it, just think about your own fight", said Spieth.
None of the players have any choice.
18 holes, where you have to hit the maximum.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unshakeable favorites for the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming European couple has four out of four and can't make a mistake.
The Mollywoods were the only pair to miss bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the other nine holes on Friday morning.
This round and the way the energy flows between the stormy crowd and the players confirms that these players will be beaten on Sunday, and it's hard to find a more popular player to cement a potential European win at sunset over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Best of both at different holes at the same time.
But it is still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial of Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he was playing doubles with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes drilled a hole for the Spaniards and the Swedes, from which they could not dig any more.
There's no one here to help you dig yourself out of the hole on Sunday.
Fourball and foursome matches are fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give each other, and also how the strategy can change from minute to minute.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a substantial lead on the final day, but these foursome rounds also showed that the US team is not afraid to fight, which some, especially on the American continent, have doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup , Europe takes the lead 10-6 .
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a substantial advantage after finishing Saturday's fourball and foursome matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The cheerful duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to add four points to their tally at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, trying to keep the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the failing American side in the morning fourball games and won the series 3-1.
In the foursome, the Americans offered more resistance, won two games, but could not make up their deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while along with Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", they are only the second pair to score four points in their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball games, they've perfectly consolidated their performance, beating a down-at-heart Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who was reeling from two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but ultimately lost 19 of his 29 fourball and foursome games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who missed the morning fourball games, returned to join Henrik Stenson in the foursome and together beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka  one and three in the world rankings.
But Europe was not at all easy on that pleasant, fresh day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They earned a two-and-one-on-one win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball match and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fourball match after losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit to enter the individual competition, although Furyk's side as defending champions need only a draw to retain the trophy.
After two days of second place, however, it seems that Sunday's counterattack will likely be beyond their strength.
North Korea will not unilaterally disarm without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions had deepened mistrust of the United States and that the country would under no circumstances unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual general assembly that North Korea has taken "substantial steps of deterrence" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we are not seeing any response from the US", he added.
Without any confidence in the United States, there can be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way we will be the first to unilaterally disarm.
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's opposition to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his stance was crucial in not immediately rejecting unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the current US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula while Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea tried to bring about a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States declared that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on nuclear disarmament first and raises tensions through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way and even by objecting to the Declaration on the End of War, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions will bring us to our knees is an illusion for people who know nothing about us.
The problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump, which the US president told the United Nations earlier this week.
However, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: If the other side of the nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the US, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have fallen into such a dead end.
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korean missiles targeting US territory was inevitable after the evil President Trump called Kim a suicide missile.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, sang at the UN to praise Kim for his courage in taking disarmament steps, but said he still had a lot of work to do and sanctions must remain until North Korea is rid of its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for it, saying it didn't matter if it took two, three years or five months.
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue strictly and without exception until we achieve complete, final and verified nuclear disarmament.
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with the statement that progress had been made, but hours later, North Korea condemned him for making "gangster demands".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile test site and nuclear complex if the United States took appropriate action.
According to him, Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he expected were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
The goal of this year's new course at Harvard University is to get all students to get more sleep in an effort to counter the growing trend of caffeinated studying all night.
Researchers have found that students at the world's leading university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of health care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Clinic, has developed a course he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after a lecture he gave on sleep deprivation and its impact on learning.
And at the end of it, this girl came up to me and said, "Why am I only learning about this now, in my senior year?"
She claimed that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first implemented this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance while improving overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said that the university decided to open the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the workweek.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section of the screen shows a picture of a boarding house where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine, light, and how lack of sleep affects sports performance and the importance of regular sleep.
In the next section, participants will learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons further encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know  just as everyone has a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes", added Professor Czeisler.
There is still a culture in which students are proud to be able to study all night, he says, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation has become a growing problem.
Getting enough good-quality sleep should be a "secret weapon" for students to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said, even against gaining weight, because sleep deficits put the brain into starvation mode, so they feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his seminars last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to try to push the course across the university.
He hopes that in the next step, it will be possible to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before embarking on a demanding study.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set their alarm clock for both bedtime and wake-up time, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Meng 's goal has sunk Gerrard 's men .
The Rangers suffered another round of grief in the away game when Dolly Meng's shot sentenced Steven Gerrard's battered team to a 1-0 loss at Livingstone.
Ibrox guests were looking to record their first away win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side brought Gerrard only his second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his side 8 points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half and the Rangers, lacking in inspiration, were nowhere near even.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston has moved up to third and is just one goal behind Hibernian.
And the Rangers may have more problems after linebacker Calum Spence suffered a head injury after being hit by an object apparently thrown from the visitors' stand.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances and Rangers then beat Ayr to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt kept the same 11 Livi had taken last week from Hearts, and was thrilled to see his well-assembled squad strangle their opponents in every action.
The Rangers may have dominated in possession, but Livingston was more active when he got to the ball.
They were only supposed to score in the second minute of the game when Meng's first call off the field sent Scott Pittman heading for Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance.
Keagan Jacobs' long straight then found captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, was able to miss the back of the net by a distance.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third, they seemed to have more hope than conviction in their game.
Alfredo Morelos claimed the right to a penalty after 15 minutes of play when he collided with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
Rangers managed just two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely out of the woods by a header from Lassan Coulibaly and a short kick from Ovie Ejario.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been a game changer, no one can deny that they deserved it for their efforts alone.
The Rangers again failed to match Jacobs' corner.
Scott Arfield was unresponsive when Declan Gallagher passed the ball through a hole to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and chose Meng for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at halftime, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the exchange had almost immediate effect as the winger found Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed out of his line and blocked him.
But Livingston kept forcing the guests to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett shooting one long ball at a time.
Holt's side could have extended their lead in the final stages, but McGregor defended Jacobs well and then took on Lithgow's wide corner.
Rangers' backup Glenn Middleton later claimed a penalty for getting involved with Jacobs, but Thomson again missed.
The inventor of the Geiger computer
And now here's a page from our Sunday morning news: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... that was the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm  Hans Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger computer.
The Geiger computer, besides being an integral part of science to this day, became a pop culture staple when it was featured in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" by science-loving cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What the hell is this?
Rogers: It's a Geiger computer, it detects radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you actually hear the sounds of atoms that are produced by radioactivity in minerals.
Seriously, I can hear them popping!
HANSS Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and processing them in the laboratory
They then see a protein common to many types of cancer and inject it back in.
The tested vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells lost her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
In this method, the patient's immune cells are extracted, modified in the lab to detect a protein common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then the cells are injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 promotes the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and teaching them to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West with a MAGA hat on his head was criticized for supporting Trump after appearing on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
When he finished his third song, Ghost Town, which he wore a hat that said Make America Great, he went on a rampage against the Democrats and emphasized his support for Trump.
I've talked to this white guy a few times and he said, "How can you recognize Trump when he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago, he said.
Saturday Night Live (SNL) kicked off with a scene with Matt Damon in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault charges from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although West's speech was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted it on social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West by sharing his story.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time backstage for his hat.
I was bullied backstage.
They told me not to go in there with that hat on.
I was bullied!
And then they told me I was at the bottom, "he declared, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see me at the bottom? I'm going to put on my superman cloak, because that means no one's going to tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
His comments earned buzz from the audience at least twice and other SNL performers were embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling the media: "There was a grave silence throughout the studio".
West was brought in as a late replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many when he performed "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West was backed by TPUSA conservative leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "Message to one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing up to DAW".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was just being himself, and that's absolutely amazing".
But I am determined NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music, his clothing brand or by promoting his talents) who I believe embraces and promotes an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
And we are too, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to Ye, formally known as Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name, he's following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also named Snoop Lion, and then of course there's the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist, formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder for stabbing a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police have confirmed the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, has condemned toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones from HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor condemned the stereotype of the boy hero, saying that such on-screen characters often make young boys feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he says he feels something is off and is thinking about how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star, Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that he felt that it was important to address this problem.
"I personally feel it's very important to address where we've gotten a little off on our masculinity", he said.
What do we teach men during adolescence when the problems we see now arise?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity for its overly masculine characters.
He continued: "What is born and what is learned?
What does television teach and what is happening on the streets that makes young boys feel that they must have this particular aspect of manhood?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time -- how can we change this?
Because clearly, something's gone wrong with the young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that when the show ends next summer, he will no longer be filming any prologue or sequel to Game of Thrones, because he's just finished with the battlefields and the horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in the new adaptation of Sam Shepard's play True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing that has ever happened to him on Game of Thrones.
"Through this show, I met my wife, so in a way, she gave me my future family and my future life", he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose Ygritte played Kit's character's love interest, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie Family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 percent increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people in the country are infected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, more than 40 000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
But in the interim, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission result from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that her employee would leak GOP senator data, criticizing "dangerous lies and conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff sent the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators to the Wikipedia page of the legislature.
The Los Angeles Democrat says the accusations come from far-right experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and other vile lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate jury trial on sexual harassment charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked for some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP addresses that identify the source of the leaks were associated with Waters' office and provided information about a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This unconfirmed allegation is completely false and utterly false", Waters continued.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of such fraudulent and false allegations was not responsible in any way for the leak of this information.
This unconfirmed allegation is completely false and utterly false.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, among others from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"Her denial is full of anger", wrote Fleischer.
It indicates that she doesn't have the temperament to be a congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he must not be angry.
He must not behave in a defiant manner.
He must not question the plaintiff's motives.
He needs to be calm and composed.
Fleischer was apparently comparing Waters's response to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running for Waters's seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big one", he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of the fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and held legally accountable for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff".
Johnny English reviews another hit with a downsized spy parody of Rowan Atkinson.
Nowadays it's common to look for references to Brexit in every new British-looking film, and this is also true of this reincarnation of the action comedy parody starring Johnny English  which was first introduced in the 2003 film Johnny English and brought back to life in the 2011 film Johnny English Returns.
Will it become an ironic self-satire about how obviously incapable we are of a new national export item?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English with his distinctive face has taken the opportunity to screw it up again  while his name signals better than anything else that he is a generous comic creation intended primarily for non-English audiences.
He's, of course, the clumsy secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to subtle charm, has a little bit of Clouseau, a little bit of Mr Bean and a spoonful of the guy who contributed a single note to the opening theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
His character is also originally based on the international traveler and mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten television commercials for Barclaycard, leaving a mess everywhere.
There are one or two pleasant moments in this latest adventure of Johnny English.
I loved the way Johnny English came to the helicopter wearing medieval armor and the propeller gently hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is there, but the humor is a little understated and oddly superficial, especially when serious film labels like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves are now offering comedy as one of their components.
The humor seems to be aimed more at children than adults, and to me the strange adventures of Johnny English are not as inventive and apt as Atkinson's wordless gags in the delivery of Mr. Bean.
The current backdrop of the film's story is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy web and, to the horror of acting agent Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately has only a small role, has revealed the identities of all British agents in the area.
This is the final straw for the prime minister, who is a pompous and combative figure already on the verge of collapse from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with a quasi-Theresa May type character, but she doesn't have much to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that if every active spy is exposed, she will have to call someone to retire.
So Johnny English himself comes on the scene, now employed as a director at a fancy institution, giving private lessons on how to become a secret spy: here are some pleasant gags, like English giving School of Rock-style espionage lessons.
So English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets his former long-time valet Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a troubled submarine commander, whose role is a bit of a shame for Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin, who are masters of disaster in Her Majesty's secret service, are back in full force and stumble upon the beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova as Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously seduced by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Walt played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd skirmishes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a glitzy French restaurant; they cause chaos by sneaking onto Volt's luxury yacht; and English unleashes sheer anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality device to explore the interior of Volt's house.
All the tricks are rolled out in the last minute, but as impressive and stormy as they are, the whole thing feels a little like a children's television program.
The whole impression is more or less average.
And as with all the other Johnny English films, I still have to wonder why the British film industry doesn't finally give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labourers deny working under Britain's four-day workweek plan paid as a five-day
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is reportedly considering a radical plan to have the British work four days a week but get paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants corporate management to reallocate the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to give workers an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend, but would take home the same pay.
Sources say the idea would be consistent with the party's economic plan to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day workweek was supported by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "We expect the evaluation of the proposal to be published by the end of the year".
It will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is an effort that is consistent with the Party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as with the Party's overall industrial strategy.
Labour would not be the first to support this idea, with the Green Party including a four-day workweek in their 2017 election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as a whole has not yet taken up the effort.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not a party policy, nor does the party consider it".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to lay out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell has expressed his determination to take back power from the anonymous CEOs and service-rich.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies would not get their full shares back, as the Labour government could apply 'deductions' for a found fault.
It also confirmed plans to include workers in company boards and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10 per cent of the wealth of private sector firms to employees, who could receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on 60 Minutes asked if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency's findings could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that aired Sunday, 60 Minutes anchor Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI had anything to reveal that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"But of course", Kennedy said.
As I said, when I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the charges were made, I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined and unambiguous.
But it seems that Graham's voice is already firmly established.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and there's got to be some kind of bulletproof indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has denied everything", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And no one he's nominating can confirm that.
That thing is 36 years old.
I don't see how anything could change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how does it contribute to poverty reduction?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event, will take place in New York City, featuring an impressive star-studded lineup with an even more impressive mission: to end world hunger.
Now in its seventh year, tens of thousands of people will gather on the Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers must complete a series of tasks, or actions, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of the event's goal of ending poverty.
There are 12 more years, so how far is Global Citizen really going to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts a convenient way to convince them to demand action, or is this just another case of so-called "clicktivism" where people feel like they're actually making a difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million shares from supporters since 2011, moving towards different goals.
The organization says that these actions have helped to spur world leaders to declare commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the amount of the aid granted to the beneficiary.
The group estimates that the funds seized have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs who have pledged to help children reach their full potential, pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make malnutrition a thing of the past, said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to a live concert crowd in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after over 5 000 actions calling for better nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide 5 million women and children with nutrition allowances.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the website, What do you think is the basis for ending extreme poverty?,
Global Citizen said: "It's going to be a long and difficult journey.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the celebrities who will perform at this year's event in New York, along with hosts Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the navy as a " blockade " to limit Russian energy exports , says the Home Secretary
"If necessary", Washington may call in its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke reportedly said that Russia's involvement in Syria  where they are acting at the invitation of the legitimate government  is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the main reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy there just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe", he is alleged to have said.
He says there are ways and methods to deal with it.
"The United States can use the navy to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, blockade them to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to attendees at an event being held under the auspices of the Energy Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit group that stands as the voice of energy consumers in the US.
He further compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic option against Iran and Russia is more or less the use and substitution of fuels", he said, noting that Russia has only one trick in the pocket because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The announcements come as the Trump administration embarks on a mission to promote liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which would make Berlin a "prison" for Moscow, according to Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is driven by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was opposed by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with third countries interfering in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that requires a woman in a top position", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren said on President Donald Trump's behalf during a town hall meeting that he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has openly expressed her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, she tweeted, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
But a poll released Thursday showed that most of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, fifty-eight percent of the "likely" voters in Massachusetts said a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his potential candidacy and 48 percent opposed.
Other prominent names among Democrats being discussed in connection with a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make a formal decision by January, The Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin speaks at a rally for Donald Trump about PTSD.
Track Palin, 26, was drafted into the Army on September 11, 2007, and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son has been going through since he came back, I can relate to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers are coming back with", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the elephant in the room and said of her son and other war veterans that they go home a little different, a little rougher, they come home with the question of whether people have respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have given to this country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report and possession of a firearm while under the influence of drugs, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal objection to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. filed an amicus brief in Washington on Friday in support of asylum seekers' objections to the new policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been released.
She said that her partner and his sons, members of a violent gang, abused her, but the US authorities denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Representatives of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which are home to a high number of U.S. asylum seekers, as nations facing serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy ignores decades of state, federal and international law.
Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be assessed in the light of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a decision violates that principle, states the amicus brief.
The representatives further argued in the filing that policies that deny immigrants entry are harmful to the American economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs and supply the necessary labor force.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, said Sessions in his June 11 policy statement.
Asylum was never meant to be a solution to all the problems  even all the serious problems  that people face every day around the world.
The death toll in Palu doubles and desperate efforts are underway to rescue survivors
For those rescued, the situation continued to deteriorate.
"It's very tense", says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while trying to rock her troubled son in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
Ambulance is bringing bodies in every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Residents began returning to their destroyed homes, going through their flooded belongings and rescuing whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered fractures to his spine and shoulder, were resting outside the Pal Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside for severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recalled the feeling of the devastating earthquake that shook his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he lived with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save.
I think the falling ruins pushed me against the wall", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her, or my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of bullying through propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in the American daily promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador accused China of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid ad in the Des Moines Register's China Daily, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, a charge China denies.
According to what US officials told Reuters, Trump's accusation of Beijing trying to interfere in the US election is a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to run ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war, with both sides adjusting tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs in the early days of the trade conflict were meant to hit exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
As Branstad wrote in his column for the Des Moines Register Sunday, "China has now doubled down on bullying by running its own promotional ads in our free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, China is taking advantage of America's revered tradition of free speech and free press by running paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
On the contrary, in the newspaper stand on the streets here in Beijing you will find only limited dissenting voices and you will not get any real picture of the diverse views that Chinese citizens may have on China's problematic economic trajectory, as the media are heavily controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, he said.
He added that "some of China's most prominent newspapers have refused his offer to publish his article", though he did not say which newspaper.
Analysts warn that the Kavanaugh debacle will cost Republicans their chances with the female electorate.
With many leading Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, analysts warn that they will be retaliated against in the upcoming midterm elections, especially by women.
The emotions surrounding this case have been extremely strong, and most Republicans have already expressed their desire to go to the vote.
"These things can't be undone", said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article for The Hill published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that a last-minute request for an FBI investigation from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) would be enough to appease angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, not even in November, said Karine Jean-Pierre, a consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, to the Washington Post on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted in the Senate hallways "November is coming!" as Republicans on the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's candidacy despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will transcend all boundaries, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
People say that motivation is already high; and it's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among undecided suburban women voters and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who, while not fond of the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a backlash could ensue if Republicans confirmed their support.
"For the GOP, it's become one big mess", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News earlier last week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets on the bench, it's about how Republicans have handled it and how they've handled it", said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
But Americans seem divided over who to believe at the dawn of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with Ford's favor leaning more toward her.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pushed away by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals when they attended a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world wide web plans to launch a new Internet to overtake Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, called Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide whether their data is retained and who is allowed access to individual information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind the Inrupt project was "world domination".
"We have to get started now", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data warehouse or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and work tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, and they're all coming together in one browser.
The unique feature of a personal online repository is that only the user decides who will have access to the individual types of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
Inrupt's intention, according to CEO John Bruce, is to bring the resources, process and appropriate skills that make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few in-house developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could start building their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not in talks with Facebook and Google about whether or not they will implement a complete overhaul that will completely overturn all their business models overnight.
We don't ask them for permission.
In a post on Medium posted on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
While running Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Father Bernard Vann: commemorations of the Victoria Cross wearer during World War I
The only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was celebrating his 100th birthday in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel the Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack at Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, and he never received Britain's highest military honor.
At a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren unveiled a plaque on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was incredibly symbolic that the tablet was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning heroic struggle.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin, through very thick fog and heavy field and machine gun fire.
Later, he rushed across the line of fire and with "great bravery" led the troops forward, single-handedly destroying three field guns.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions... were something I'd never come close to in my life, but it brought me a deep sense of humility.
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he laid the wreath at the conclusion of a procession led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very honoured to be able to attend the parade, adding that "the courage of a true hero shows the support that many people give him".
MMA fans waited late into the night for the Bellator 206 finale and instead got Peppa Pig series
Imagine staying up all night to watch the thrilling finale of Bellator 206 and then missing the main event.
The San Jose schedule featured 13 matches including six majors and was broadcast live all night long in the UK by Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were set to face off, viewers in the UK were shocked when Peppa Pig appeared on screen instead of being broadcast.
Some were really disappointed because they waited until the morning especially for this match.
One Twitter fan described switching to a children's story as "some kind of sick joke".
"It's a government directive that from 6:00 this content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
Yeah, it was Peppa Pig.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would work to make their broadcasts available to UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about repeaters, I think we can sort this out", Coker said.
But it's Sunday at 6 a.m. their time, and we won't be able to solve it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it happened, we exchanged a lot of text messages, and they weren't exactly friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a matter of government regulations.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We're gonna cut it down to five games instead of six... like we usually do... we tried to give the fans a little more and we pulled it off.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality.
Olympic diving champion Tom Daley says that during his teenage years, his sexuality made him feel inferior to others, but that's what motivated him to become successful.
The 24-year-old athlete said it wasn't until high school that he realized that not everyone is like me.
In an interview on the first ever Desert Island Discs show on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became a little less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off for sickness.
In the role of the outcast on the first Laverne Daley show, he said that during his teenage years he felt "less than everyone else" because it was not socially acceptable for anyone to like both boys and girls.
In his own words: "To this day, I have felt truly inferior and different, and this has given me the strength and motivation to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was something, but he said not to let anyone down after they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a leading LGBT rights campaigner, and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke up because he was lucky to live openly without consequences and wanted to give that hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man -- American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- it took him by surprise.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
"When you've survived so much at such a young age" "you went to your first Olympics at 14 and three years later your father died of cancer" "it's hard to find a peer with similar successes and misfortunes".
The couple became parents in June, their son Robert Ray Black-Daley was born, and Daley said his whole worldview changed.
"If you asked me a year ago, I would only talk about how I needed to win a gold medal", he said.
And you know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept the idea of death, and one of the last things he asked him was if they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, Dad, you're not gonna be here anymore so you can sit in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he really stopped breathing and was dead that I finally recognized that he wasn't immortal", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew this is what I'd been dreaming of all my life... jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling", he said.
The story also inspired his choice of the song "Proud" by Heather Small, which impressed him in preparation for the Olympics and still makes him shiver.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson in poor form down for Saturday's Ryder Cup games
American Phil Mickelson will set a record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he'll have to show a better form than that to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was dismissed by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourball and foursome matches.
Instead of being the center of attention, as he had been many times before for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day alternating between cheering and improving his game in the hope of repairing his reputation.
The 48-year-old wasn't a straight shot at the peak of his career, which is not ideal for a tight Le Golf National course where long-course mistakes usually get revenge.
And as if the course itself wasn't challenging enough, Mickelson faces defending British Open champion Francesca Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who has won every match this week in a pair with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who are four points behind with 12 individual games to go, get off to a good start, Mickelson's performance could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, but he could hardly say otherwise.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, grabbed me by the shoulders and said he'd be ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed significantly to our teams in the past and this week.
I guess I just couldn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but this is how it crystallized, and we felt like this is exactly what we needed to do.
She wants to be out on the lawn, just like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It could be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never reached the heights of his individual balance.
Mickelson has a record of 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk says his presence has brought some incalculable value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make fun of people and is a great companion", he explained.
I think the younger players had a lot of fun with him, and it was great to watch.
His contribution is not just in his game.
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that strong leadership can soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from firsthand experience that a considerable lead going into the individual events on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an awkward ride.
The Danish golfer made his debut at the 1997 event in Valderrama, where the team under captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but still crossed the finish line with the closest possible victory of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"I have to keep reminding myself how we had a strong lead at Valderram; we had a strong lead at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderram, we did win, but just like that", said Bjorn, in the photo, after the 2018 team won 5-3 on Friday and led at Le Golf National yesterday by 10:6.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that the game isn't over.
We're going full gas tomorrow.
We're gonna stand on the lawn and do everything right.
Until the points are on the board, the game is not over.
We have our goal, and that is to win this trophy, that's what we have to focus on.
As I said from the beginning, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but I'm also very aware that we're up against the other side  against the best players in the world.
Enthused by how his players were doing on a challenging golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never anticipate events.
We have another fight tomorrow.
Tomorrow it's individual performances, and that's something else entirely.
It's great to be on the court with a partner when you're doing well, but standing there by yourself puts all your golfing skills to the test.
That's a message the players have to remember, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now leave your partner and he has to go and get the best out of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, teammate Jim Furyk will want his players to play better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of the big tournaments on the final day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up losing as Europe achieved the Miracle in Medina.
"I remember every damn word", he said in response to a question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 cheered his players on to the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want to get started fast like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When this momentum is going in one direction, those middle fights are extremely important.
We created our lineup and positioned the boys in a way that we felt like we were going to try some magic tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and faces Rory McIlroy in the top match, with the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the top half of the standings.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I thought we'd go all the way", Bjorn said of his selection of individuals.
The new German warship has been delayed again
Local media reports that the German Navy's newest frigate was scheduled to enter service in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but that won't happen until next year due to faulty systems and cost overruns.
The commissioning of Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, was postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, quoting an army spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project suffered from troubling problems after delivery.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
They are known to include high-powered cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reduced radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic tracking.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods − it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside domestic ports.
But the continuous delays mean that the most advanced warships that have allowed Germany to prove itself overseas will be obsolete by the time they enter service, reports Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned several major "software and hardware flaws" that made the warship unusable for deployment on a combat mission.
The software shortcomings were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors − only half the workforce on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne vessel Rheinland-Pfalz is considered to be twice as heavy as similar classes of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project − including the training of the crew - becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) − up from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, confirmed that the navy did not have ships capable of deployment.
The government official said that this question has been settled over time as old ships have been decommissioned but no replacement vessels have been provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were capable of entering the navy.
The National Trust uncovers the secret life of bats
New research at a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
We hope that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the wheelie and the wheelie, as well as the light and water bat in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
The organisation's staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
A professional audio analysis of all recordings will detect the frequency of bat calls and activity of each species.
They then map their natural environment and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a large scale.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the natural environment are most important to bats and how they are used by different species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of environmental management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and Britain have declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which affects grassland and environmental loss.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as aircraft and some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by domestic cats can also pose a danger.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears like eyes when it comes to hunting prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to pinpoint insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of assembly sites, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established the first and only dedicated bat sanctuary at Threave Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave, we have an amazing bat room", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of protected trees and all good habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about the primates, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive.
It stresses the importance of checking the bats before carrying out maintenance on the property, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of one mother colony could kill up to 400 females and young, likely wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, abuse, disturb, or destroy their gathering places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to get involved.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how many of our species feed on their populations".
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while lawyers file a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls rape allegations "fake news" and says people want to "make themselves known" by using his name.
His lawyers are suing the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram during a live chat, calling the allegations "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
What they said today is fake news, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to make themselves visible using my name.
It's not a bad thing.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of my job.
"I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel magazine over allegations they called "unacceptable reporting of privacy suspects".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damage" in an amount commensurate with the severity of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy rights in recent years.
The alleged incident was said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was a 99% good guy who disappointed by 1%.
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "scared of retaliation and feared public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman says she's now trying to reconsider the agreement because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: UK would forever regret losing carmakers
The UK would forever regret losing its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnstone plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could reduce jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my view, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our plant", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive in Burnston.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about how cross-border trade would work if they leave the EU without a deal.
BMW, for example, says it's closing its small plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what carmakers refer to as supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line is operated on a just in time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-built cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a border disruption, which could lead to delays and shortages of parts in industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than the daily value of its stock in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU was 'precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls'.
'We need to have a deal.We want to have the best deal that allows us not just to talk about the success of today, but to seize this opportunity,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Proof not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is the fact that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.
Toyota could not say for how long production would stop, but warned that in the long term the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately increase the cost of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnstone for 24 years and is a member of the factory's union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed, says White House
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed to next week as Brett Kavanaugh's fight for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump advisers and Russia, and potential obstruction of the investigation by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been a rumour in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of using wiretaps to record conversations with Trump and impeach the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied this report.
He went to the White House last Monday with new information that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was at the UN in New York, on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified in.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, has appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about meeting Rosenstein, she said, "There's no date set for that, it could be this week, I understand the move to another week given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
We'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed.
Some reporters have denied this claim: Sanders has not held a brief White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of brief press conferences was not due to a dislike of TV reporters wanting to shine, though she said, "I don't agree with the fact that they want to shine".
Then she suggested that we increase direct contact between Trump and the press.
The President does more Q&A meetings than any other President before him, she added without providing any evidence: Let's look at the numbers.
Short press conferences will still be held, Sanders said, but while the press has a chance to ask the question directly to the president of the United States, it's incomparably better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, and you've seen us a lot in the last few weeks, there's going to be a brief press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Separate press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by freely and several times bizarrely appearing before a gathering of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland over Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working at the National Health Service in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wishes for them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to reimburse the costs of permanent residence applications for EU citizens working in their devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: During the summer, the UK and EU continued with negotiations on leaving, leading to the expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK Government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reports.
Tennessee State head coach Reed told reporters he was injured just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and somehow collapsed", Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further testing.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is in Vanderbilt Medical Center after surgery.
Harris added that there are no details on the type/ extent of the injury yet and the Tennessee State team is working to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore at the university, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five complete games on Saturday before retiring, bringing his total to 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher flat-rate fees when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher flat-rate fees when they buy property in the UK, raising additional cash to help the homeless under the Conservatives' new plans.
This move neutralizes the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters
The increase in the tax on heels will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May today announced that foreign buyers will be charged higher tolls when they buy property in the UK.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in the sticks tax will be levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay UK tax, the additional funds will support the government in the fight against sleeping on the streets.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current hip tax, including higher rates introduced two years ago on second homes and rental properties after purchase, could be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to bring in up to £120 million a year in funding.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get into the housing system.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially the capital, have become ghost towns for a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new strategy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for lowering the cap to help young people own their first home.
He accused the big construction firms of keeping property prices high by fighting over land but not using it, and called on May to drop quotas on affordable housing to correct Britain's housing disgrace.
Corbyn has announced a compelling series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He also wants to give the committees more power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would devote my office to renewing the British dream, that life should be better for each new generation.
That means consolidating our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But we cannot allow it to be as easy for non-UK individuals as it is for companies based abroad to buy houses as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become too remote, and the indignity of sleeping on the streets remains too real.
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to manage Scotland".
Sunderland Football Team boss Jack Ross says his ultimate ambition is to become Scotland manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scot is relishing the challenge of reviving the north-eastern club, who are currently third in League One, three points clear of first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after being promoted to the Scottish Premiership with St Mirren last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a baseball cap, and that's what Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
But as a kid, I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad, and that's something that always drew me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I am successful in running the club.
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic claims that he has no concerns about such high-profile names following him at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success will be measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
"Because of the structure and the equipment, this club is definitely in the Premier League", he said.
Getting there is no easy task, but I would probably consider myself successful if I could only get the club there.
Ross has only been in his managerial role for three years, following a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month rotation as coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to League Three and turned St Mirren from a relegation-bound side into championship winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he recalled when he joined Team Allo.
I really believed that management was more suited to me than acting.
It sounds bizarre, because I was doing well, I had a decent standard of living, and I enjoyed some reasonable maxims.
But acting can be hard.
There's a lot of stuff you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I still do it when it comes to stress and pressure at work, but I feel good about managing.
I've always wanted to drive, and now I'm doing it, which makes me feel more confident that I'm in the right place than I've ever been in my entire adult life.

Analysis reveals that the perfect time for a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
Summer heat has boosted sales in Britain's struggling pubs, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data revealed that the pubs and bars sector recorded a sales increase of 2,7% in July, but that the restaurant sector saw a decrease of 4,8%.
Peter Martin, CGA's business adviser who compiled the data, said: Continued sunny weather and England's longer than expected World Cup attendance meant that July followed a similar trend to the previous month, June, when pub sales rose by 2.8%, except for restaurants, which were hit even harder.
The decline of 1.8% in restaurant services in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars fared much better than the restaurants, which saw a decline when the same factors were taken into account.
Foodservice pubs also saw a decline, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems people just wanted to go for a drink.
Within the pubs and bars managed, sales of drinks increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales fell by 3%.
RSM leisure and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of domestic sales.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales will be particularly painful given continued cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators with food offerings, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August provide the much needed relief.
The overall growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand uptake.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitoring for the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over GBP 9 billion and is an established industry standard.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Research has revealed that one in five children, some under the age of 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram accounts.
Reports have raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children, some under the age of 11, set up social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts, a photo-sharing site.
The reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a good main account, which they showed their parents, and they also had a private one.
One mother who came across a secret page of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager urging others to rape her.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40% of the population aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half admitting to having private accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online sites where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes at the Scottish Athletics Committee .
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
Eilidh is held in great esteem by the Scottish, British and world athletic communities and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit from her being on the board, said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I want to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help run sport in Scotland.'
An American who won the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and who has four Olympic gold medals in total and who is a regular commentator for the BBC, has overcome a transient ischemic attack and is now unable to walk.
He tweeted: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if and to what extent I would recover.
It is exhausting work, but I have made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises.
Thank you for the encouraging news!
A breast milk extractor ad comparing mothers to cows is dividing the online world
A company that makes breast milk extractors has divided the online world with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to breastfed babies.
To mark the launch of the "world's quietest wearable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a pompous music video to showcase the freedom the new vacuum gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a dream-filled barn with cows to a song that has lyrics like, "Yes, I'm sucking milk, but you can't see any tails", and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't named, these are my breasts".
The chorus goes on, "I pump, pump, pump, feed my babies like this, pump, pump, suck out my beauties".
However, an advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy in the online world.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it belittles the dangers of the dairy industry.
Very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
"They need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, just like we do, except we steal their babies from them within days of giving birth", wrote one woman.

Another user commented: It is understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah, why not use them to promote breast milk pumps for mothers who keep their babies?
Another added: "Advertising disconnected from reality".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she felt the song was "gifted".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy a vacuum cleaner if I was still breastfeeding.
When I sucked the milk, I felt exactly like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I take it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product, wrote one woman.
Another user commented: An entertaining ad for moms who suckle (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all danced with discreet breast pumps tucked into their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who suckle milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's breast pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold babies, and even to suckle and spend time outside.
Ana Balarin, partner and mother in the Early Childhood Development Programme, commented: The Elvie breast milk extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between women's voices and those of breastfeeding, we wanted to bring the focus to breastfeeding and all its challenges, while demonstrating in a fun and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new vacuum will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's vacuum cleaner has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two showed up at a showcase for designer Marta Jakubowska using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children peacefully moved into a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children detained has increased, even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the tough rhetoric and practices put in place by the Trump administration have made it harder for children to be placed with supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters have been illegal immigrants themselves, who feared that they would jeopardize their ability to remain in the country by claiming a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Chief Matthew Albence testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who applied for unaccompanied minor support.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either supporters or members of the supporters' households are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are foreign nationals with criminal records.
So we're continuing to track these individuals, Mr. Albence said.
Officials, trying to process matters involving children more quickly, have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days as was the previous standard, shelter workers say.
Many will present themselves via videoconference rather than in person to present their case regarding legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are classified as not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to fall into anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape, shelter workers and reports that have surfaced in the system in recent months have said.
Advocates said that these concerns are heightened in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs of a child's suffering are more overlooked because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could cause the trauma that many struggle with.
Syria will tell the American, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "we will deal with them accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to fight in this holy battle until it clears all Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence.
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, who are primarily training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were right for their return and accused 'some Western countries' of spreading irrational fear, which led refugees to stay away from home.
We call on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns, he said.
They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for continued political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has averted a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had clear terms and expressed the hope that the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which would be removed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to the revision of the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump is getting a second term
By this logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020, although many liberal viewers are likely to hope that his presidency will end the impeachment and scandal early.
That would be, without a doubt, the most dramatic end to a presidential term ever!
So far, there's no sign of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the average prime-time viewership on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million and on MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News averages 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen said, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has a peak rating of up to 3.5 million on prime-time news nights.
"This is a traveler that attracts people because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, creator of the ABC drama series The President about a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, the veteran writer of the comedy series Just the Funny Parts: And Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
Before the 2016 election, he remembers driving a cab in Boston.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Trump.
Why? " she asked.
He said, "Because he's funny", Scovell told me.
There is a fun value in this chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
But it's beyond the knowledgeable citizen when you find yourself spending six hours watching a panel discussion on deeper issues such as the source of Bob Woodward's book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather bomber jacket, and the consequences of Stormy Daniels's stormy descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Maria the same way again.
"Part of what he does is like a reality show that feeds you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, of the Trump show's daily airing with a recurring segment and daily plotlines (starting a fight with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode because you'd be behind.
When I came to Mr. Fleiss's this week, it was sunny 26 degrees outside on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was staying inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from it, not with Brett Kavanaugh being brought before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court uncertain.
I remember when we used to do all these crazy shows in the past and people would say, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was just a joke, but they were right.

Money from outside is pouring into midterm elections for a seat
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to a redistricting that has left two candidates vying for a seat.
This recently redeveloped Pittsburgh suburb is facing opposition from Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th Pennsylvania district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The fight in the new 17th District has involved campaign finance between the major party financial arms, the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a widely-watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a slight lead.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador instead of supporting China, then withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight departure from Washington.
Trump attended a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted Trump's organizing team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the US diplomatic chiefs of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated US$140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in trying to stop migrants from heading to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administrative officials made clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively conclude any assessment of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now attending a conference scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, diplomats said.
Three US ambassadors have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further serious news or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on details of the discussion to Mr. Bolton, which were described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
Another unexpected development could be the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice of President Trump, of which there is now very substantial evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly turning his investigation into whether the Trump campaign was linked to Russia in the attack on our election.
If Congress were to change sides, Mr. Trump would face accountability in this body just as he prepares to go before voters and perhaps a jury of his fellow House members again.
That's a lot of conditions, if I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable - or its equivalent in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice in how we can influence the prolongation of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, but this would have to be resisted by the West and supported by the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around such inflection points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing some of these tipping points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this report announced that he proposed secret recordings of the president last year and speculated about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' explanation is inaccurate.
How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, are we going to vote in midterm congressional elections to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will go into a long hibernation.
I believe we are not failing because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, she immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that swastika table.
With a history like this, I just have to be optimistic.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers feels optimistic about meeting Rapid Vienna .
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that a win over the Austrians following an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could get something, and we walked away with a point.
We may have pulled it off in the end, but overall, the draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we showed more in the second half and were a better team.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get the three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good performance in their last game, but with the fans behind us, I'm sure we can push them and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now it's in the game factor that makes us feel good.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying it, we're having a great practice.
Hopefully, we can now push past last season and be successful.
Women are up all night with fears of retirement savings
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members.
About half of the individuals in the national study said they talked to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't take steps to talk", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance for Nationwide.
This is where we start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caregiving if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Work with your counsellor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as this choice can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your options for financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets - if you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in a crisis.
Get a healthcare proxy to identify a trusted person to oversee your healthcare and ensure that professionals meet your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Also consider the power of attorney for your finances.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to work.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write these details down in a written plan so that you are prepared.
"It's not just about the money, it's about who the doctors are", Martin asked.
What will the medication be like?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep this plan in place.
Man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he left his home at night.
The victim, in his 40s, was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at around 02:30 BST, as a random act.
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police are urgently searching for witnesses.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said.
Due to poor communication, humanitarian officials were unable to obtain any information from the regent's office in Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palus, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency stretching over 300 km (180 mi) along the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The regency, an administrative region belonging to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, the cities of Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggale.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala City in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province, Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hits the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake strikes near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits the island of Mentawai, off Sumatra, and causes a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroys dozens of villages and kills about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hits Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminds people of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin 's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence .
Track Palin, eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested and charged with assault.
29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence enforcement and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Highway Patrol report released Saturday.
According to the police report, when his acquaintance tried to call the police to report the crimes, he took her phone.
Palin remains in custody at the Mat-Su detention facility and is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU TV reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded guilty, the television station reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a domestic violence report and possession of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu as the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullah Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people -- a rare death sentence that hasn't been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side of Lower Manhattan on October 31 by hitting a pedestrian and a cyclist on the trail.
According to a death penalty notice filed in the Southern District of New York, if prosecutors want to get the death penalty, they're going to have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally inflicted serious injury.
Both of these charges are punishable by death, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder with intent to extort, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and cold-blooded thinking", prosecutors said, and the manner in which Saipov carried it out was described as "abominable, cruel and perverse".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlija, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucca", according to the report of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York handed down the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he was finally sentenced to life in prison.
The last federal death penalty was carried out in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has shown a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
According to the indictment, Saipov said he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he also asked to have an ISIS flag displayed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were obviously disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe the decision to seek the death penalty instead of a guilty plea and life in prison without the possibility of parole only prolongs the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage, during a protest at the Conservative Conference today, solemnly promised to mobilise the People's Army.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to risk an awkward situation from Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he take charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham in March that the UK would be gone by now if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in easing her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted by pro-Remain conservatives who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain a compromise plan amid attacks from Brexit supporters, Remainers and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she would continue to push for a deal with Brussels despite resistance - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr Bone has expressed at a Leave Means Leave meeting his intention to dismiss the Prime Minister.
He suggested that Mr Farage be involved and responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out of here", he said.
The Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I support Brexit, but we need to suspend the Prime Minister".
He expressed his disagreement with the EU, saying: "We did not fight in the world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Bone dismissed the notion that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay is completely false.
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, telling reporters: "I'm simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Prime Minister is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for her, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually breaking down the streets and getting us to the top.
Please leave the PM alone and start listening.
In a blunt message to May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their seats when they keep their promises".
Farage told the assembly that politicians must feel anger if they betray the 2016 referendum decision.
This is now a matter of trust between us − the people − and our political class, he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let them.
In a speech to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel our anger".
We are mobilising the people of this country who gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, people marched through Birmingham to protest, and then a two-hour meeting was held in the city center.
A number of activists waved banners to the Conservatives against Brexit, a group formed this weekend.
Labour Party member Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over security concerns with the party's application at the opening of the conference.
"These are people who tell us they can have information systems in place and all the technology for a borderless border and free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete hoax.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to give her presidential bid a thorough consideration.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will consider her candidacy for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election against state Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There was speculation that she might beat Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th town hall meeting since Trump took office.
A participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that requires a woman in a top position.
Arrested in the shooting of LSU Sims.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police said Saturday they have arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayden Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyton Simpson at 11 a.m. ET at a news conference.
They released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man who is captured on the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University's boarding school early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde went to help his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being present, carrying a gun, and confessing to shooting Wayden Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-2 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Lewis Hamilton moves closer to the world title after team rules brought him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday against Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team's commands would play a major role in the race.
From his best starting position, Bottas got off to a good start and almost put Hamilton in an awkward position when he defended his position in the first two corners and challenged Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first, letting Hamilton get into the traffic at the tail end of the group, which was to be decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit stop a lap later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a close lead in which the Ferrari reluctantly left the inside with the risk of having to defend a third time after a double stroke.
Max Verstappen started in the back row on his 21st birthday and was seventh by the end of the first lap.
He then led much of the race, keeping on the track and focusing on a quick finish, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and reaching fourth.
He finally got into the pits on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a busy day because Valtteri worked fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman and let me pass by.
"The team has done an exceptional job, it has an exceptional combination of two strong personalities", said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday for insisting she didn't publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke at a convention in West Virginia, he did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead noted that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were lazy, disgusting, and dishonest.
"One thing that could happen, and that beautiful thing that's been happening in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and greedy and disgusting and dishonest", he said.
When you look at the leaks and the leaks and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you go public with this?
Remember her answer... you released the documentary  oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I mean...
I didn't publish it.
Okay, wait a minute.
We published... no, we didn't publish, he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and the letter was released in early September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's claims, I did not publish her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as she asked.
But the denial didn't seem to sit well with the president, who said during the Saturday rally, "I'll tell you what, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but she had the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the claims for their own ends.
They are determined to seize power by any means necessary.
You see the vile, the indecent, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to gain power and control", Mediaite reported the president's statement.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 to 5 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee Hockey team.
The Dundee Stars made up for their Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning a rematch in Dundee on Saturday by a score of 5:3.
The Giants have a two-point lead on the clock thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
With Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowne, the home team tied, but Dwyer then re-established the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee's place, but then Lukas Lundvald Nielsen gave two goals to secure their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men, who turned the score around and beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the rivals, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening play came in the fourth quarter at 3:35 with an assist from Kendall McFaul and four minutes later an assist from David Rutherford as Beauvillier doubled the lead.
During the hectic opening period, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt secured Cownie's tie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead into the first half when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first quarter.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard again tied the score with a goal during the goalless game in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen secure the lead for Dundee in the second half for the first time in the game and he secured the win in the semi-final.
The Giants, now down four of their last five games, play at home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died trying to secure the escape of a plane with hundreds of passengers before the earthquake
An Indonesian airline operator is being hailed as a hero after he died after securing the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have died and many are still missing after a massive earthquake hit Sulawesi island on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong tremors continue to hit the area and many people are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat in the wildly moving rocking tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pala.
He remained in place to ensure that flight 6321 Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, took off safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Indonesian air navigation, said that this decision saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper reached Pala.
"We were very sad to hear about it", he added.
Meanwhile, experts fear the death toll could reach thousands. The country's disaster mitigation agency says access is restricted to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number is likely to keep rising because many bodies were still under the rubble and many people we could not reach", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet [6 m] high devastated Palu, where a mass funeral is being held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Bodies are being brought in by ambulance every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what we'll find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Earlier this year, earthquakes struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports one man missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia says one man is missing after earlier reporting that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that one man was reported missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon just before the start of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
"It was a huge stroke of luck", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to climb the belt of deep water to an emergency exit in a sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to improve the pier also helped with the rescue by using inflatable boats to tie people to shore before the plane sank to about 100 feet [30 m] of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network databases suggest that 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered in PNG over the past two decades, but Air Niugini was not involved in any accident.
Analyst sets a time line for the night a woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors on Saturday completed charges in a re-opened trial against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used cell phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed his cell phone was there at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, with Chambers, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday and confirmed he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records show they only met for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Jessica Chambers died, Tellis deleted her messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense plans to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go before a jury that day.
The High Breed: what is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based group The High Breed argues that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and re-popularise conscious hip-hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are experiencing a resurgence in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing after racist text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrongly sent text message from her mother complaining that she's another black woman.
The couple denies being racist, likening the lawsuit to "blackmail".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed shock when she learned that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at work on her first day in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman texted her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing her mistake, a disgraced Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that their departing caregiver, an African-American, had done a poor job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Mrs. Maurice is now suing the couple for severance pay and is seeking compensation of $350 a day for a period of six months for accommodation work with the employer she was originally hired for, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that this kind of thing doesn't happen", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple has denied the accusations of being racist, arguing that terminating Ms. Maurice's employment was a sensible thing to do because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist, "husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you put your children in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
But go.
Comparing the lawsuit to "searching", Plasco said his wife had a baby of only two months and was in a very difficult situation.
Would you go after someone like that?
That's not a very nice thing, "the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, the public quickly condemned the couple on social media, citing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers were concerned that readers would not relate to the talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's enormous success.
She said that her father was optimistic about his job rejection, and before he got the idea and wrote a children's book about a teddy bear, he worked as a cameraman for the BBC, and she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "bittersweet" because of his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of Paddington's eventual success, who she described as a very important member of our family.
"He was a very quiet man and not a boastful one", she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who had accomplished something: you're proud of it, even if it's not really your fault.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, she and her daughter were rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me it was really bad, that he wasn't expected to make it", said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me and said she was gonna die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications she was given by doctors to keep her heart functioning were slowly rotting and leaving her system.
She died shortly before, and that's how it ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing all this was going on.
I couldn't moan, or scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - despite the suffering she had endured.
"No one knew about it", she said.
I kept my head down and I cried the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a tremendous compassion for Nada.
I realized that she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Loss of a Lover's Message to Prevent Suicides on a Bridge
Two women who came to commit suicide for their loved ones, trying to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place links to the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want any parent to go through what I have to go through every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile would light up any room.
But he gave up his work before he died, because Hannah was a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his sibling after he took his own life.
Mrs Davis said: 'I'm constantly worried that it's going to have a chain effect.'
Mrs. Davis created the links to let people know that there are people you can come to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit quietly - you have to talk.
Mrs. Davies' longtime friend, Mrs. Humphreys, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
On Christmas Day he was at the bottom of the sea - when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at them or anything else.
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to get over it: "It's going to leave a hole through the whole family.
It's killing us.
But we all have to keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI begins an investigation
"I thought that if we could really achieve something he was asking for - a time or scope-limited inquiry - we might agree on something", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was worried the Commission would "fall apart" amid the obstacle.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do not succeed, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to get the man they elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, lobbied to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes the report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to reverse the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors has been declining under Kim.
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 defectors last year − compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the key factors are stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most will flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, officials from both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stalled denuclearization talks.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work on a nuclear-free peninsula in a broader sense.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said the lack of progress was due to US sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way we can unilaterally disarm first", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament was not fit for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in a Saturday interview at the Texas Speech Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman did it, they would say she was hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Mr. Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and choking as he discussed his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated type of assassination" organized by liberals angry over Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Mrs. Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony would prove he can't serve on the Supreme Court because it would show he's biased against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with these statements and the way he's persecuting the Clintons and Democrats", she said.
Pelosi was evasive when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if his nomination was confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'll say this: If he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only not fit to be on the Supreme Court, but not fit to be on the court he's on right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh has avoided questions in his hearings about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Isn't it time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Oh, isn't this wonderful?'" said Pelosi.
And women have to master it.
It's a legitimate attack, months and years of rage that can't be contained, and she can't talk about it without crying.
"When we get angry, we cry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, is it?
She continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere, and she said that she also cried when she got angry, but she started using the procedure that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I 'm angry .
And then she just kept going.
I think it's great.
Tears are partly permissible as an outlet for anger because they are extremely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of my early work in a predominantly male office, where I once cried out in indescribable rage, is an older woman, a cold manager who I had always been a little afraid of, grabbed me by the back and pulled me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they got under your skin.
Patricia Schroeder, later a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his campaign for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair aboard the ship Monkey Business and ended his candidacy, a deeply frustrated Mrs. Schroeder realized that there was no reason why she shouldn't consider running for president herself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the game, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Some people call it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign was already underway, she was behind in raising funds, so she promised not to enter the game unless she got $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave the men $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm a lefty?" She wondered.
During her speech about not launching an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so hard to get money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism -- that she choked.
"You might think I've had a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder recalled the press reaction.
You might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my tombstone.
The one who was crying?
How can a US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The initial barrage of the US-China trade war has been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, the dispute between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items, effectively taking half of all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in the same way each time, recently imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of goods.
China has promised to cope with the US tactics and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to give up anytime soon.
To make a concession to Washington would mean to submit to demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, a public American compliment would be even more embarrassing.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing plays its game well, the pressures of the US trade war could positively support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that trigger economic chaos in one country is actually much more dangerous than we've previously observed", said Abigail Grace, an Asia researcher at the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Syria is "ready" to welcome refugees home, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, said that conditions in the country were improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he does not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe confirms victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup tournament by defeating the USA team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six straight on European soil and hasn't won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who has failed in most tournaments, fired his first shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole and gave up his fight to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to go 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by the lowest-ranked player on the European team Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain became the record European tournament winner with a career-high 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I thank Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very happy to have our cup back.
"I'm happy to have been able to help", Garcia said, emotionally moved by the European victory.
He handed the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods by two holes with one hole remaining in Sunday's singles match.
"I feel incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A curious statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the right path except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf at a high level throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk came out after a disappointing performance in front of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, the time has come to make Europe uncomfortable.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna re-form the group, work with the USPGA and the Ryder Cup Tournament Committee, and move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to have been captain.
Take off your hat.
You beat us.
Red mud status: Concentrations are falling in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission shows a general decline in red mud concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Florida Commission, inconsistent coating conditions are reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating decreasing concentrations.
Red mud extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast in the Hillsborough area, but in fewer places than last week.
Red mud was also spotted in the Pasco area.
Medium coastal or off-shore concentrations in Pinellas County were reported last week, low to high marine concentrations in Hillsborough County, high concentrations in Manatee County, high coastal or off-shore concentrations in Sarasota County, medium coastal or off-shore concentrations in Charlotte County, high coastal or off-shore concentrations in Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier areas.
No respiratory tract irritation has been reported in northwest Florida in the last week.
