Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, overall they come to 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties in the previous grand coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, according to the first preliminary results.
Particularly severe losses were suffered by the Austrian People ’ s Party, where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the tilt.
In contrast, the election leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democracy (Social Democrats) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8% of the votes, but it loses 5.5% of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the Left Party cut down, losing almost nine percent of the votes at 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and this is a truly catastrophic result, especially for the People's Party, which had called for the early elections.
At the beginning of July, when the Democrats had withdrawn from the coalition, the People ’ s Party had a clear lead over the Social Democrats.
But voters have probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about a possible resignation of the party leader and former Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, that is to say to a renewal of the grand coalition of the Democrats and the Democrats.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) temporarily received 18 percent, while the BZÖ received eleven percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party had agreed with the populists (at that time the Freedom Party was still uniform, in 2005 it split away from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which had even caused sanctions from the European Union.
It is obvious that Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is prepared to cooperate with each party, is counting on this development from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal politics.
The party of the Greens also took part in the parliament, but it suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four trial hurdles and therefore did not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who were indicted in India for the illegal gathering of beetles, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be some cooling down of the Czech relations with India.
This was stressed by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this does not clarify, then surely, then there will be a certain cooling down", he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
After the talks, Mukherdshi said that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
In spite of everything, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the indictment and received a fine, the central government wanted the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be resolved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi's view would be best if he were to appeal to a higher authority.
He could so request release on bail and wait freely for his verdict, said the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had spoken in the same way during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene on the whole issue is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such aid was already offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit this, "Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of its partner, he emphasized the importance of the Czech Republic's problem of entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question of whether he had received from the Indian side the promise to deal with the matter, the minister avoided.
"I have already been promised quite a lot," he said.
A Czech judges the struggle for the seabed
It approaches an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are depicted.
However, it does not interest the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself, "said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member staff of the UN ’ s Divison for Oceans and Maritime Rights.
His chief, Divisional Director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it.
This is where work elan and enthusiasm reign.
The seabed hitherto contains a little known world, which is rich in natural sources.
Here oil can be found, the further ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also hitherto unknown living organisms, which for example carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed, larger than the mainland
The adjacent states today vehemently notified their claim to the new maritime areas.
After a UN convention, they are exercising their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental lull, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometers far from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of continental welfare.
"Simply put, as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It transcends the boundaries of the shoreline, often also the boundary of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone ", explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for setting the external borders of the continental lull must be substantiated by an extensive scientific technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical technical assistance.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful, "Mikulka adds.
The success of Australia, which was the first country to expand its maritime areas, recently met with an international response.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the seabed approved by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times more than the size of the country itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
The profit that will flow to them in the future from the exploitation of the sea floor will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Agreement of Montego Bay".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is called "common heritage of humanity" by the Convention.
No state has a special position here.
The right to promote this is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold-digging land," says Director Mikulka with some exaggeration, adding that "individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific Ocean
Part of the sea floor also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it was granted the status of a so-called "pioneering investor" due to the Convention, as did the investors of a few other states.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawai and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"One can promote there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetals containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, "said another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such concretion as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with a little imagination, of the fabulous shem that, according to legend, brought to life the Golem.
German special forces were on site during hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
More and more details are becoming known about the conditions of liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Accordingly, both specialists of the Bundeswehr as well as officials of the GSG 9, the aviation squadron of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Police Office and logistics experts of the Technical Relief Agency were at the site of liberation.
However, as spokesmen of the ministries continued to report on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as a local support force.
"Fortunately, this has not happened," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had kidnapped the group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions on September 19 in the south of Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages were abducted back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until the end, as did the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The saved have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages were in the custody of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
At first there was no information in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the specialists are to be flown out with an airforce Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
United States House of Representatives rejects rescue package
The US Congress ’ s first chamber has narrowly failed the $700 billion bailout for financial markets.
The Dow Jones was rushing into the depths.
By 206 votes to 227, the US House of Representatives rejected the government ’ s bailout for the financial markets.
In spite of all the appeals of US premier President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, there was no majority in favour of the program to curb the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, supporters had desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called on MEPs to vote in favour, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for the avoidance of something that has not yet occurred," he acknowledged.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones broke by more than six percent or by 600 points.
Investors were worried that the government bailout could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure had become known, he fell again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence on the international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate must be approved.
Organizers register rising booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased considerably compared to the previous year according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, a study shows that the German travel expert remains untarnished.
As regards bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in sales compared to the same period last year, as reported by the German Travel Association (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the research conducted by the market research institute GfK, bookings have already increased for the autumn months.
The increase in sales of travel agencies for October was around eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
These results are based on GfK figures, which evaluate monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and calculate it for the overall market.
The travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 were recorded.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the USA is particularly in demand, the DRV informed.
Here, the increase in bookings is around a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the native regions are particularly sought-after destinations for the Germans.
In particular, package trips are high on course, said DRV's President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, the costs "are better calculable for the customer than for an individually organized holiday".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early bird discounts or all the inclusive offers, Laepple said.
Also the summer months had been very well booked, so that there will be again a turnover increase compared to the previous year - although according to another study the number of Germans who undertook a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Ballermann - Apres - Ski - Hits in the endless loop, beer made of litres - Krügen and celebrities in Designer - Dirndln.
A Oktoberfest debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She is blonde, TV presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, am a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing unites us: Hardly three minutes on the Oktoberfest, the photographers already fall on us and kneel the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first meadow visit.
This is how you make friends.
The cheap Dirndl seems to fulfil its purpose.
When Wiesn ’ s Touri and actually located north of the white worm equator, the feeling of well-being in the costume remained limited until now.
But first arrived on the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather trousers; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything completely normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand harvests only my dirndl apron.
A coin woman reminds me that I had tied the apron incorrectly: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, forgiven right, widowed behind."
I secretly friemel the loop from back to left.
"Fits," said it and laughs.
Others make less effort to create subtle flirt techniques and wear plain felt hats on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and unsolicited stretch the naked back.
The young man with exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long pulled "ooooo".
This is what he tells me after he got rid of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, everyone thinks he is a dustbin.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wild bieslers".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics run in droves across the festival square, which must take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at once drag a covered carrying from tent to tent.
This works like most Oktoberfest visitors: Empty, full back.
If you are lying under the tarpaulin under the coffin, you will not see.
"That's the ones, wos goarnimmer packn," one of the paramedics called to me on request and disappeared in the tumult.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63 year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51 year old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
Meanwhile he was released on bail.
Turkey Expands the Diplomatic Horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, European powers were interested in penetrating deep into Turkey ’ s hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
This is at least what the guides tell you.
The building sits rittlings at the end of the platforms with a tower at every corner of the front and thus looks like any provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building decays about
But once you are inside the curved ticket counter, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project, the westernmost access of which was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia Baghdad Society.
Germany, which was a hatcher in the imperialist game, had to face its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through a train link to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany ’ s imperialist plans paralyzed during the First World War.
His railroad rails were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, generated by the insurmountable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces came out of Egypt and urged the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917, a ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly decayed, largely overlooked by history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and all to the east to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from neighbouring regions, generated by the limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key figures of this new foreign policy, I climbed the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city, for the new secular state plan to turn my back on the Ottoman past.
But the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has caused some distrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP ’ s main office, a specially designed, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-finished shopping centers and pubs where middle managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exception, "he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays it must look to the east and west at the same time.
There would not be either the one or the other.
It would have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could eventually," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to have to face this decision."
He then emphasised a point that almost everyone I spoke to here almost routinely said: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be able, in a figurative sense, to drive Europe as a whole on just those railway tracks east towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpashas station, after another night, largely sleepless, I thought of these two German lords Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched building this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe ’ s ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in Turkey ’ s hands.
And when I was waiting at the dock for the ferry that was to bring me back over the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At the time, at least, there seemed not much doubt about which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford ’ s musical director since 1962, Vernon “Tod ” Handley (obituary on September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of his musical programme for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
He was intended for young people up to 21 years, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979 some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) stood for the readiness and ability of the choir to tackle any piece of music presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and existed only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music, which never followed for years.
How often did death stop us to "let the music speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So it sings! "
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never herrical but never surpassing.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded a higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I have written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by a single - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He abhorred conductors who, according to his words, simply "went into the world with one or two well-known actors."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (September 25) you write that "in 1946 he resumed teaching economic history in Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon and Norman research scholarship... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from an author's note in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British rubber industry".
He was 1951 in the United States in the course of a Houblon Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham definitively and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
'I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and because of the power they radiate, as they always deal with respect for the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magic moments. '
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large-scale sedan offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical subtleties that enable even more comfortable driving and fuel savings.
Changes before the imminent revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made in this grand limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics will be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you begin to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation had appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sale in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also in the course of this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83,000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars, representing 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As far as the new generation of the model is concerned, the managers of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2 000 Jazz models per year.
More precisely, the release of the new Honda Jazz model enables the sales cut to be covered up in Spain.
In reality, brand leaders hope to complete the year with a total sale of 22,000 models, which is 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this sales growth, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda is counting on the release of a new model.
It is an insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, and the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer ’ s market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the rest is distributed across the Old Continent and Japan.
The launch of the Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has grown 5 centimeters.
The height, however, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new room flexibility programme and, on the other, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of jazz.
Also the capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading space, reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres larger than the capacity of the trunk of the first generation.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the trunk of Honda Jazz with a 1.2 litre petrol engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, apart from the additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, an improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have a VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine runtime.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves the output of 90 hp at 6 000 turns with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 rpm.
This gasoline engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto's Bee ', which avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, more precisely by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarm behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a biomimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the Nissan Motor Co. technical development center developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R & D Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the facet eyes of the bee, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows them to fly undisturbed in their personal airspace without interruption.
The technicians developed the Laser Range Finder (LRF) to reproduce the all-round perspective.
He notices obstacles that are up to two meters apart in front of the BR23C and are in a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance up to the object and sends a signal to a onboard microprocessor, which is translated directly into signal for avoiding the collision
'At the moment when obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels by 90º or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this evasive maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it were not so, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, 'explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory for Mobility and the senior engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot can not deviate upwards or downwards, but also not obscure; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and infinite ways as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
'This device only takes a couple of seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require neither the information nor the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres made to save, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozens of KB of storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it is not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan prophesied to introduce in the next ten years in production cars.
The robot works with Lithium-Polymer -batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of Lithium-Ions -batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite in order to lead up to the target while driving, avoiding the obstacles along the way.
It trembles before being burdened with a mortgage.
It must be acknowledged that the US Treasury, apart from having sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to prevent the US citizens from being involved in mortgages, stories of the supposedly paid-up banks have been developed an entertaining and informative game for the Internet surfer: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe, the 'hotel of bad loans' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think once, twice and up to three times if it is the moment not to ask for any credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Certainly it has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a site for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dream room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it is not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes her capital available for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into her company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend $9 billion, accounting for 21% of its capital, an innovation due to a strong fall in its exchange price.
A week after a provisional agreement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley ’ s common shares at a uniform price of $25.25, representing a total of $3 billion.
The price assumed is below 19% of the share price of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said that global business will be conducted on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, 28% above the current price value.
However, the Morgan Stanley premier share fell by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars against 17.00 GMT.
'This strategic link is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank ', said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, allowing him to expand their business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street ’ s biggest names to adopt a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has changed over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply declared that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
'A week ago, 'said Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo,' we thought that the stake would consist entirely of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price value for its Morgan Stanley Shares.
And business will proceed with a reduction in earnings by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into ordinary shares in one year if the latter are exchanged more than 50% above the sales value within a given period, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds supplied by MUFG will enable him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a group spokesperson refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to register a payability ratio of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan said that he had 'significantly' lowered his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks were tough for the group, which had to watch their exchange price drop by half, while the price of the insurance against insolvency increased.
This price decreased on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivor' of Wall Street's major investment banks following the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that he had withdrawn some $15 billion from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Re-establish the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorial Rafael Correa.
It was that third party who, following the example of his like-minded and friends, put to the election this Sunday the plan of a new constitution.
Mission accomplished, because according to the public results of 80% of the votes, 64% voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballot papers were invalid and 0.7% were left empty.
For the constitutional project to be adopted, more than half of the votes cast must be cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organisation announced a clear victory for 'yes' and predicted him to be 63% to 70%.
In the night from Sunday to Monday Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly', he had insured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, held in silence in accordance with the observation of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure the 'new socialism' for which the President is committed.
The Constitutional Project transfers state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely on the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign currencies that send emigrants to the country.
The project, promoted by the Correa elected in 2006, also admits to the head of state greater power, which will be able to exercise up to two successive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he will make use of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also safeguards the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
In the end, it also proposes to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of a equatorial base as the base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon healthy and intact.
In the morning they were liberated from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages arrived on board a special aircraft at around 3.30 p.m. at the military base al ‑ Maza, right next to Cairo International Airport.
They were brought directly, without being able to speak to the press, aboard a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a suburb of Cairo, to be examined there.
They all enjoy 'best health' and the kidnappers' no ransom was paid ', said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the field.
After being captured on September 19 by an off-road vehicle Safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hiding place by 35 unknown kidnappers.
There are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, on board two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
'Shots fell on both sides and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled, 'said this person who wants to remain anonymous.
He said that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported on Belgrade, where he is, about the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
'We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the secret service and the special units', he explained without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the day, the Sudanese army had claimed that a patrol had stopped a terrain vehicle in which the kidnappers were found, of which they killed six, including the leader from Chad, and two arrests.
The army declared that they were in contact with a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan -Unité (SLA -U) movement, but this movement immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is central to the current election campaign.
That is all the better.
But an area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise and denounce the miserable sums of money granted to the small museums, to the archives, to the archaeological excavations or to the national historical places which are dying of starvation?
Which politician will dare to remind the Federal Government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing 3.5 million euros only for the restoration of the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbors, the Constitution of their country states that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government districts, by mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the Association of History Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 historical societies strive to deal intensively with history, to save the numerous private archives with a few penny, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, who protest with the power of despair when supporters and decision makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux Governments nationalize parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux authorities want to help the Belgian Fortis Bank, which was in turmoil as a result of the US financial crisis: the three states provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the bank and insurance institution, which also has subsidiaries in Hungary.
The Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands discussed at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has lasted for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the Bank could be a precedent.
In line with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the bank ’ s respective shares at about 49 percent.
The Bank will probably sell part of its investments, notably the insurance activities purchased by ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis have started a steep descent last week, and serious crisis scenarios have already emerged in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too large for bankruptcy.
The securities of the Institute fell by 12% on Friday to a 14 year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
Given the current stock prices, the market value of the group is EUR 14 billion, but this is unrealistic according to management.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion US rescue package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets are to blame for the decline of Fortis ’ shares.
On Monday, however, the courses increased slightly.
Filip Dierckx was appointed new Director General of the Bank on Friday.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but there was no interested person with a factual offer.
However, the Belgian Government was trying to reassure - no investor was to tremble for his money, it said.
There has been no panic among customers, the bank ’ s branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fox in the chicken stable
Due to a person ’ s drug use, life and health insurance in America often refuse to sign a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of drug data to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the fox the chickens "- quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance determines the fees and payout amounts in the event of damage depending on the health condition of the customer, and if the risk is too high, the insurance will not be taken out at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was concluded only in knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago Dick invented a far more favourable method: Based on the customer's identification number, he obtained the data of the last year and a half from the pharmacies, i.e., which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates which illness the customer suffers from and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large quantities of cholesterol lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat level is untraceably high, which would automatically place him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk calculator, so insurance only needs to do the paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many drugs can be taken for various purposes, such as migraine and hot flushes, but also depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the perspective of insurers, while the above does not.
For the query and processing of the data, own companies have formed, which, before they receive the data, ask the patient for his consent.
They now have to do so by law, although omissions have not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory examinations and combine them with data on drug use, providing an even more accurate picture of patients ’ health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect only extends to health service providers and insurance companies.
The draft law has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to develop his programme further, so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to his or her data, because otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him or her.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the mercy of the fox.
Global Menu from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After both the European Union and India are each other ’ s leading trading partners, this was the main topic among other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, there is also the French summit of India, which mainly discusses cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic power that should be given more votes and a say on international concerns, the member states have not yet been able to agree whether to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council, or not.
This issue was not discussed yesterday at yesterday's ninth Marseille Summit.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to raise it to a good EUR 100 billion.
Given that the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil flight agreements with India have also been legally consolidated into an agreement, so that aviation will also be encouraged in future.
By 2009, India intends to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India's number one partner, New Delhi ranks only nine among the EU's partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
Among them was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, as well as the convening of a UN conference.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for failure.
The EU underlined its commitment to its energy and climate programme, which is to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, as was the proposal to reach a sort of global compromise at the next climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the subject of financial crisis.
The Indian head of government today visits the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, orders for French companies worth EUR 20 billion are expected for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be decided for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries to attend the current event. They will be distributed over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and will present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour for the event.
Maria Giro, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, will represent the Italian Government in the exhibition hall during the opening ceremony: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives around publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers decreases in the whole, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
The small plane of billionaire Steve Fossett disappeared a year ago
The small plane by Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 on a flight over the Nevada desert, was found.
The items have been found on a plateau of 3000 m altitude, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely quenched the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been localized to which a troop was sent. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the aircraft or its vicinity.
The 63 year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The American Office for Traffic Safety (Ntsb) noted that a team was sent out a few hours after the aircraft was inspected, identifying the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett launched a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, some of Fossett ’ s personal items were also found in California, near the Nevada border, by a couple near their home at the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two cards named Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned one month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history through a long sequence of records.
In 2002 he succeeded in the sixth attempt to circle the world ball in a hot-air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later he flew around the world in a single flight without a stopover by plane.
Among his many records is also a flight of 15445 m over the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you don't expect
A Suv that falls out of conventional schemes due to its original design and special lines, the spreading surface and its clear angles.
With this off-roader Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector.
Particularly because of its extraordinary characteristics, the presentation of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be shown in the Mercedes Showroom from 17 October.
The advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D-campaign - this is a novelty in the car rector in backward Italy.
A project with maximum effort, which will be carried out in different facets, which will take the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, whereby 3D eyewear, which are distributed near the Corso Como, should give the whole a special look: the new Suv will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear so seemingly from the poster on which it is depicted.
The new Glk is then illuminated in all its details with the help of Elumina8 and technology in different moments, in order to reassemble itself as a whole.
There is no doubt that Mercedes's intention with this advertising is to introduce a new type of car advertisement into this rather stereotypical field.
But will it succeed in stimulating the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto - now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150 boys and girls, for whom all Italy is ashamed now? They are part of the grouping "Ultras Italia", which travels for years after the Italian national team and which, frankly, until recently did not cause serious problems.
Never before came collisions with opposing fans.
The origin of the group is in the right milieu.
The sponsors come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These were joined by other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia in Sofia.
They carry the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: these were removed on Saturday, however, to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a clash with a truly right-wing radical fan scene, that of Levski.
Of the Figc, 144 cards were made available to the Italian fans for the game: they were all on names and therefore easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia, no one was in an ongoing stadium ban.
Four fans of the Italian team, who had already been burdened in this respect, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal awaits the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case the arrested Tifosi identified in the riots can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums across Europe.
Our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Fortunately.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitators who could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be withdrawn immediately, and that does not in any case give such behaviour the possibility of justification", it says from the Viminal.
Therefore, "eyes on especially also with regard to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Indeed, in Puglia there is a small nucleus of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (sports supervision) will gather, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services, which deals with the problem of the stadium authority.
"Duce -Duce calls and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed without joy), who for the last few weeks has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Before that, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, now comes from.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but without doubt the behavior of these 150 '200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the No. 1 of the Osservatorio - crimes are punished in the country of their deed.
So far this group had kept in check, but now we have to reconsider what happened and what will happen.
But let us also talk about the whistles during the Mamelis hymn: this, too, is not a crime, but they allow me, because education is missing '....
