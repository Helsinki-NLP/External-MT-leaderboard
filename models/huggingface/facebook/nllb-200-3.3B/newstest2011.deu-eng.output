The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Konditorei".
The new City Council leaders from the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old and new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and the City Council.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has been a little "tapping" on the new council members from the ČSSD as they master the notorious slang that has become naturalized in recent years, when today's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the era of former mayor Pavel Bém, is borrowed from some of the best known actors, situations and causes.
The new councils were surprisingly somewhat in the dark about these new concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I have no idea".
"I'm more of a novice in Prague politics", said Lukáš Kaucký, the new Minister of Culture, in response to the test of the "patent vocabulary".
But the councilor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "golf hole".
"That's the only expression of the ones you present to me here that I use now and then".
"Other than that, I don't think much of slang".
From the glossary published by the daily Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editors picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "the biggest Prague golf hole", "go to the pastry shop", "bullshit", "treason against the capital" and "blank".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, while the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised to participate in the conversation, but then did not even take the phone.
The fifth councilor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the start.
"I don't care about these things and how the bourgeois democrats talk among themselves, I don't judge them".
"What is important to me is how we understand each other within our programmes", he replied.
As already indicated, in the above-mentioned headline, Lukáš Kaucký allegedly did not realize that the influential businessman and friend of the former Mayor of Bém, Roman Janoušek, was being referred to.
The term "Voldemort" doesn't tell Kaucky anything, and the only term he guessed correctly on the test was "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel", Kaucký says, adding, "but I know it from the newspaper".
And jokingly, "I guess I'll have to take a language course".
The "Golfloch" is then not only deciphered by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Councilman for environmental issues Lukáš Plachý correctly as Tunnel Blanka.
Both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find this figure and thus what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague catering establishment", Plachý is pretty close to solving the riddle, if you know that this is the seat of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he claims to have extracted this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary was his own.
The results of the survey show that the Social Democrats do not have a similarly integrated group.
"I asked my colleagues, but obviously we don't have that kind of thing".
"We call each other by name, and occasionally we use abbreviations or nicknames", says Prague's ČSSD chairman Petr Hulínský - known as "Hulda" by his party colleagues.
"In school, I was called Bříza (Birch), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that", says Karel Březina, who shares his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz tried the name and look - it works.
Ratsherr Weinert is friendly to the party members as the "Opa" or less friendly as the "Alte", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by scheming in party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
The only thing the Social Democrats allow in the internal party language is nicknames.
Hulínský reportedly does not like being called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber Butt Law" is allegedly related to the fact that Petr Hulínský acquired his title of Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop torturing "witches" and has published a brochure
Women who are branded as witches in Burkina Faso tend to share some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to be of the older generation, they cannot find work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If any of these women "become" a witch, they are strictly isolated so that they cannot become a danger to the rest of the village.
"Men are rarely affected by this fate".
"Even young and healthy women are spared this, as they help with the work and give birth", describes a nun who cares for more than a hundred women who have been cast out of their communities in a special home in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso.
The local government decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And that's why he put out a pamphlet to stop the witch-hunt.
But there's a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read", noted the newspaper derStandard, pointing to the dilemma of literacy.
But accusations of witchcraft are common in other African lands as well.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmahová, 27, was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured petroleum on her and simply set her on fire.
This incident was reported by the BBC server among others.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the incident was just a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, the oil that is used for ritual anointings is ignited.
This was after the group had tried to "expel an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by the people here, regardless of their education.
The Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "The human soul-snatching business was once as dangerous as it is now".
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to reduce the witch-hunt, the Gambian President has been very much involved in the affair himself over the past year.
"President Yahya Jammeh has launched a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, alleging that they were responsible for her death and would now try to kill the president himself with black magic".
"He called for the help of shamans from neighbouring Guinea, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, violently abducted indiscriminately detained women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai", Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the prisoners were forced to drink a potion made from plants that had hallucinogenic effects but also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the people arrested did not survive the farm.
It was only as a result of international pressure that the nearly one thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - but still pays higher rent
An elderly sub-contractor is leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of apartment buildings in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm, a briefcase with three new leases for three apartments: his own and his daughters' apartments, and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
The three of them have just been given rent increases as part of the so-called deregulation.
Instead of a monthly rent of 3500 krones, the son should spend 4100 krones next year for a two-room apartment with a second-class kitchen.
"And there's not even hot water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal stove", he angrily taps his finger on his son's new lease, which he has the power to sign.
"But what - I signed it", he explains half-displeased and half-resigned.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new lease terms "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new lease contracts and to wait until December 7, when it plans to publish a guide on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man just waves.
"One says this, the other says that", he makes a gloomy face.
The Ostrava region is thus becoming a major 'de-regulation laboratory'.
After the new year, this deregulation will affect most of the rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not paid market rent until now.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already at 9 am this Tuesday it is packed to capacity.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a pager.
"Rent 2011", a special touch screen is illuminated.
A little tap and the machine spits out a number.
We've barely deciphered the number "157" and it's already beeping on the big screen on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enter the waiting room to ask about the rent, but the storm in the waiting room does not seem to apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and so on.
From mid-November, envelopes with the new leases start to arrive in the mailboxes of most of the tenants of the total of 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio in the Ostrava region.
RPG Byty proposed in the letter a rent increase of between 15 and 38%.
The special desk for new rentals in the customer centre has been open since 18 November.
"The action has been going on for a little over a week, so this is just the beginning", the ladies behind the counter reply after a moment of hesitation, when the "client" reveals himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and the former miners' residences in Bakala are a hot topic.
Before the elections, the deputy speaker of the Parliament Lubomír Zaorálek from ČSSD, who is from Ostrava, took up this issue quite loudly, and it is no wonder that the newspapers are full of it today.
"For 20 years I've been asking them to give me a new floor".
"No shit. They could have changed toilet glasses", the man mentioned at the beginning of the article breathes.
So far, according to the employees, it is mainly pensioners who are waiting at the counter to see if they will really get the promised rent reduction that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer on time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease agreement by 15 December will also benefit from a half-rate in February.
So far, however, the "de-regulation switch" in Havířov is far from overwhelmed by demand.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 were due for rent in 2011", the counter clerks estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements where it considers this to be necessary, both on its websites and on its wall boards.
If the parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not meant to be a threat, but rather to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure", RPG explains on its website.
"No one is going to court here", says one of the RPG Byty employees, and a man on the street outside the customer service center agrees with her, at least in part.
"I have a pension of 13,000 (Kronas), 5,000 of which are left over for food, where would I get the money for a lawsuit", he says.
That's what makes the employee feel insecure.
"Let me see".
"Mr Zaorálek tells them through the media not to sign and so people are waiting", she adds.
The regulated rent will end in most of the Czech Republic on New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing rent level is not even enough to maintain the housing fund", argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of RPG Byty, and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund, which is criticized by the rented tenants, is the main reason for the rent increase, according to the homeowners.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments from the rentals received between 2005 and 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large LCD display on the ceiling opposite the armchairs in the waiting room of Havířov occasionally shows a few red-lit information.
'The rent increases of 15% and below in 2011 concern 31200 flats, i.e. more than 90% of RPG's flats.'
'This always means no more than CZK 7.50 per square metre per month' reads the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments in RPG's portfolio will increase rents by 38 percent.
"In these cases, the issue is the increase of extremely low rents of CZK 19.66 per square metre", argues RPG.
The rent will stay the same next year for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive rents up by leaps and bounds, but will be gradual over four and eight years.
What is more, the company imposes a further commitment: all the revenue from the increase in rent (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, mainly in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But, first and foremost, these are supposed to benefit the people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw - the office includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten with all the necessary features - colorful walls, creative furniture, lots of toys, and even a mini-playground on the patio?
This kindergarten has been available to the Arch.Design staff since last year.
The design and architecture firm Arch.Design, whose studios have produced a number of well-known Brno buildings, has been planning for the premises for its company mini-kindergarten from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building.
This is a good sign, because most of its 90 employees are of baby-boom age and the company is keen to get the designers and architects back to work as soon as possible.
The possibility of working part-time is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of its social programme.
This makes it easier for civil engineers and architects to combine their demanding profession with childcare.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of the Arch.Design staff and with the support of the management, they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The company-based mini-kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
This financing (grants of CZK 2.8 million) has enabled the necessary facilities and equipment to be procured and has provided for qualified staff and operations for a period of 2 years.
After the aid has been used up (for two years), Arch.Design is obliged to continue to run the mini-kindergarten for another three years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the Economy Rating company providing active assistance in the application process.
The children are cared for by a qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, and there are no age restrictions for children, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only five children can be present at a time, but several children take turns during the day.
The kindergarten is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, and the children of all employees have the same rights in the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is an individual education and care programme, the content of the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children are not only playing but are also receiving excellent instruction, from basic knowledge to preschool education, and they are learning English in the process.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What is more, the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company atmosphere.
Parents can keep an eye on their children at all times, eliminating the stress of delayed pick-ups from a distant kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working time more productively.
It is no wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relations are also formed here.
Arch.Design thus joined the ranks of Czech companies that offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through such programmes strengthen their HR marketing.
A house of bones still fascinates after 100 years.
The roof is like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs are like the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are ripped fish lips.
This is the Casa Batlló by Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The local inhabitants nicknamed the house with its organic forms "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tiles and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of scales and the ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The house's facade plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures that evoke nature and living beings.
It's only when you look closely that you realize that everything is governed by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the entire facade is even more plastic, dramatic, and the special lighting enhances the brilliance of the colors.
The same sweeping lines and intricate shapes dominate the interior of the house.
Wavy wood is used for window frames, railings, and door ornaments, as well as for peepholes and railings.
The Batlló house in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the conversion of a house from 1877, carried out by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but eventually agreed to Gaudí's idea of an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of reality came into being, and the use of mosaics on the facade was also his idea.
However, many other artists and painters also contributed to the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá in Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was nicknamed "Knochenhaus" (Bone House) by the local inhabitants because of its organic forms.
Others called it "the passing house" because of the special window opening mechanism.
It is also said that the sword of Saint George, patron saint of Catalonia, is depicted on the top of the building.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a central heating system for the house, unique at the time, with vents and typical chimneys.
Something bizarre is suggesting its 45-degree inclination.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building codes of the time and was not distracted by them.
He obtained the city's building permit before construction began, but the details he gave about the planned reconstruction were so vague that when it was completed two years later, the city fathers were so horrified by the result that they demanded remedies.
The councilors also found that the building with its pillars even invaded the public sidewalk.
The changes were not, however, to the contrary - only fifteen days after the request from the neighbourhood, Josep Batlló applied for permission to rent the two highest floors of the building - and it was promptly granted.
The owner of the house moved into the lower floors.
The gallery on the second floor was a social hall, and the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment were on the third floor.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story building is a stairway up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reconstruction eliminated all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
But Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the drawing-room doors, and so a larger company could chat comfortably without having to forego a certain intimacy in more intimate conversations.
The house received Gaudí's remodeling, which, in addition to a new facade, also added a rather unusual roof and two more floors.
Also impressive are Gaudí's play with light, the blue and white glazed tiles that cover the inner courtyard and the lanterns.
The play of these two colors brings the maximum amount of light to all the floors of the house.
He simply used the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors, which absorb sunlight.
Casa Batlló, which was added to the Unesco World Heritage List in 2005, is now open to visitors.
On the first floor, the most spacious and sumptuous apartment is open to the public.
The owners decided to do this in the year of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was determined that this was a very profitable business, the inspections were continued, and indeed they were extended to other common areas and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The price for visiting the monument is not a paperweight, however, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist passes get a 20 percent discount.
This is more than the entrance fees for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to experience the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed frame?
It's not the best bed frame, but the quality of the bed - so a mattress and a bed rack make a good bed.
The Commission's proposal is to be submitted to the Council by the end of the year.
Many factors are involved in the selection - the weight, height, health status, and not least the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior, in which mattresses and bed rails have to be subordinate.
Typical example?
Latex mattresses are not suitable for a weekend home that is not regularly heated, as they take much longer to "get warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be changed regularly.
If they do not have enough air ducts in the core and are placed on a solid surface, moisture accumulates, so it is possible that mold may form under them.
Of course, what you are used to also plays a role in the choice.
If you have been abroad for a long time, where very high soft-coated mattresses are common, you will find it difficult to get used to a low hard-coated mattress.
"Well, all the hockey players who came back from the NHL have been complaining to me that they can't sleep properly here anymore".
"They just need a soft layer of memory foam for their shaved shoulders, heels, and hips".
"I recommend it to people with diabetes, who suffer from a nervous system disorder, which makes it difficult for them to receive the 'information' from the joints and skin", explains Sylva Hadamcziková, a specialist in upholstered furniture.
That's why I've been getting these memory foam mattresses to many hockey players and other customers for years.
"Today, this is no longer a problem, as mattresses of this type are offered by the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex and the Czech manufacturer Tropico, among others".
And you don't have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of visco-foam.
This "miracle" is actually quite simple.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the heat absorbed, in other words, it adheres to the warm body.
Nowhere is it crowded, no turning around in the night like after a heavy battle.
You sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wound burn).
When choosing the size of the mattress, the length of the soles of the feet should always be added to the height of the body, i.e. approximately 21 to 34 cm.
A man or woman who is about six feet tall needs a bed that is about six to eight feet long.
Each of the slaughterers should have at least 90 cm of bed space, i.e. 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate.
For your comfort and for any visitors you might have.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "When you are lying on your back, there should be enough space for slightly angled arms", advises Helena Prokopová, the master of upholstery and interior design, who has been working on the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for many years and also lectures on this subject at specialist schools.
In a double bed, each person needs his own bed and mattress, but be careful when shopping to ensure that the mattresses are of the same height.
Otherwise, the only option is to mount the grating at different heights, and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with a spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be on the mold layer and the fine upholstery.
"You should never touch the feathers with your hand or when sitting down", warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a specific type of grate.
Fully-mattressed beds with mattresses and pillows like conjoined Siamese twins are not to be found in the bedroom.
These mattresses can't be aired and the upholstery can't be washed, which is commonplace today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will slowly become a huge (and clogged) sieve.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans that promise a lifespan of up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty on mattresses.
Everything has its ifs and buts.
And so a practical tip from the dealers: For a 120 or 140 cm wide mattress, you should not be afraid of the hygiene of washable, removable linings, but it is still advisable to use a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although today mattress covers are usually made with a round-off, so that after opening you get two halves (very important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially carried out alone, often resembles the unequal battle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in the bed instead of a rust one?
Get it out!
Or at most for a bed for unwelcome guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should preferably provide the slab with ventilation holes (if they do not already have any) and use mattresses with spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket feathers and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not fit on such a substrate.
For non-adjustable latten bars with 14 to 18 spring bars (lamels), latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (possibly also combinations of latex and coconut), always pay for bars with a larger number of bars, i.e. from 28 and more spring bars, with a Lordosen support in the lumbar region and the possibility of regulating the hardness of the bars.
Adjustable slats shall not include mattresses with a spring frame, as they do not respond to ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to the adjustment of the rigidity of the spring-loads, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special attachment of the spring bars, which allows the spring bars to be pressed in or even twisted in such a way that they allow the pointed sinking of the shoulder of the sleeper.
It's a very important thing for men with broad shoulders.
Some mattress manufacturers have even begun to use shoulder-softening in "men's" mattresses.
The ladies are also considered - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, lattoflex wing support systems or roosts with multitortion contact pads are intended.
The pressure is distributed to several points, which reduces the tension.
- But if you use a bad (too big and bulky) pillow for the right mattress and the right rest, most of the benefits are lost.
Here again, a rule of thumb is that the pillow should support the head, its tips reaching only to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, a pillow should be 50 by 60 cm, as the Scandinavians like.
In the lateral position, the head cushion (together with the shoulder relief zone in the cast or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the old straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least mixtures of them.
The new magic word for mattresses is "organic".
Natural oils, such as castor oil and soya oil, are increasingly being used to produce polyurethane foams instead of petroleum.
Soy is used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio means that the mattress core is made of materials of natural origin", explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Natural ingredients are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in microcapsules that give off a fresh scent of forest or lavender while you sleep.
Here, too, a distinction is made between man and woman.
While men use a "cooling" plant extract made from birch leaves to absorb heat and cool the body, women use "warming" covers.
Extracts from red peppercorns stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex get comfortable warm while sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Mattresses made of calcium foam (this has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness of cold foam and visco-foam creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have to pay 7000 krona and more.
However, health mattresses are usually taxed at a lower rate because they are considered as medical devices.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and the rust is not so easy.
Occasionally, there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers offering two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with a visco-foam memory hidden in the purchase for CZK 11,990.
The second one is free.
It was the material Tempur that ushered in the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at near-cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overload during the launch.
Temperature becomes soft in warmth, and hard in cool weather.
It is thus perfectly adapted to the human body and optimally distributes body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burn but also for improving general sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses but also in other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
For example, domestic producers use the Eucatherm C foam, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human-monitoring devices to keep their kids under control.
Fears for their children are growing, and more parents are considering using GPS to monitor their children.
The system, originally designed to track cars, is just as good at tracking people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as in the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette case, but soon it won't be bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people are terrified by the case of the missing Anička and are looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of violating her privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that this is not about speculation, but about an effective way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy", says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that there are instances of misuse of such devices, for example, by putting it in someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not seen any such cases".
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons", adds Pilin.
But, he says, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková, however, points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, he simply discards it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in deliberately losing certain things when they do not want to be controlled".
"The mobile phones were already a source of great expectations among parents, but they can be turned off as easily as these new surveillance devices", says Bočková.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In planned abductions, the abductor virtually always checks whether the child has any electronics with which to track him".
"Today it's the mobile phone".
"If such surveillance devices were more widely used, they would look for them too, since their sale would surely be accompanied by massive advertising".
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police", says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
Roberta Čech of RC Monitoring, a company that provides location services for both cars and people, says that the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted to report its position at certain intervals".
"Even if it were to be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available".
"The more expensive devices even have an inbuilt tiltometer, which means that if you fall and stay motionless, the device will immediately send a warning indicating your position", says Mr Čech.
He believes that similar services could be provided by smart mobile phones with navigation, just by installing a special software.
The problem with current tracking devices is that they are either matchbox-sized devices that look like trailers or smaller cell phones.
There's always a chance you'll lose it.
According to Mr Pilin of Macro Weil, this is why people are now testing devices that look like normal digital watches.
"This has the advantage that the attacker does not have to know that it is a monitoring or tracking device.
"Or he doesn't realize until after a certain amount of time, which gives the police a head start", he adds.
So no matter what the direction of development is, whether it's bracelets or trailers, it's always going to be the same technology that's used in vehicle tracking.
So the combination of the location function using the GPS system (just like the navigation in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current location.
The army has so many lighter cords that you could wrap the whole of Czechia but you can only hold them for two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of detonation cord to be detonated with explosive devices.
The year before, the Department of Defense had already delivered 140 miles of spark plug to the Army camps.
It's comforting to know that the military has been doing its job for 225 years.
The problem is the durability of the ignition cord. Two years, four at the most.
The army bought the firing line from the STV Group, a.s. for a paltry 40 million crowns.
In his explanation for the purchase of this huge amount of spark plug, the General Staff of the Ministry of Defense replied that the soldiers would use up to 60 kilometers of spark plug per year.
According to the research carried out by army pyrotechnicians, the MF DNES asked for this information, this indicates that the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnical training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command to secretaries and cleaning women.
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to improve the quality of the information provided by the Member States.
Only this could justify the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of spark plugs.
That's the length of 25,000 detonations, by the way.
But even so, these army supplies would last for more than a decade.
But if the old rule of experts still holds that two metres of spark plug is sufficient for the training of any new professional soldier, then the army has created a reassuring reserve for the aforementioned 225 years through these new purchases - also in view of the increased need for pioneer and special units.
The soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defence Vondra that they have almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises are severely limited due to the lack of resources.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
"I don't understand why they're buying so many lighter strings from us".
But that's their decision, and they'll know what they need it for".
"For us, the army is a good customer, and we as a trader want to meet it as much as possible", says Jan Děcký, sales manager of the STV Group.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of detonator rope by saying that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group says that the ignition cord is only usable for four years, and the police and army pyrotechnicians say that it is usable for only two years.
"If the storage is perfect, the four years mentioned above are probably possible", admits one of them, who wants to remain anonymous so as not to be accused of criticizing the army as a soldier.
After the end of its useful life, all ammunition must be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
But these tests are not free, they cost more money.
Another argument the DOD is making is the volume discount on the 400-mile-long (445 km) spark plug.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers", says spokesman Pejšek, explaining the view of the Ministry of Defense buyers.
By way of comparison, the annual consumption of firing-strings by police pyrotechnicians, who dispose of munitions from the Second World War or from the Soviet Brother Army, has for some years hardly exceeded 1500 metres.
And the police always order only the amount of this ammunition that they can use before the expiration of the shelf life.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be given the opportunity to present a report on the implementation of the directive.
The Ministry of Defence is having huge problems anyway with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the two hundred thousand-man Czechoslovak People's Army was preparing for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to pyrotechnicians who spoke to the Ministry of Defence, the Czech armed forces are facing the same problem in a few years' time when it comes to liquidating hundreds of kilometres of old firing lines that they have bought so "cheaply" today.
I still need the contacts I gained through the competition
The winning entry in the Small Businessman of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell his hotel franchise.
Last year's winner of the 'Small Businessman of the Year' competition was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success is like a movie script.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
It was only after he had travelled abroad that he realised that Liberec lacked good accommodation at reasonable prices.
With the savings from his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a sixth-year college student at the time, this was a bold undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me, so I tried to do something about it", says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first apartment he reconstructed was rented to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested all the money he had earned into the house, which he then gradually converted into a 54-bed boarding house.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity, he has managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels in Liberec with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other interested parties have already applied for a Pytloun Hotels franchise", says the number one entrepreneur of last year.
'The winner of the Entrepreneur of the Year competition was a major factor in the sale of hotel licences,' Mr Pytloun adds with appreciation.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, often congratulating me even afterwards, and I must say that it was very good", he recalls.
I really recommend anyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win right away, either. Any exposure is good.
He says that to this day he benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have come at all.
"I still have regular business relations with some of the people I met through the competition".
The glory associated with success, he feels, is also reflected in a small measure by each of his employees.
And then he's about 70.
"I notice a greater loyalty and pride in them for being part of something that is generally recognized".
I really don't see this as just a personal success, no, it's the result of the good work of all of us".
"My name has only come to the fore", says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a more peaceful year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has put the worst of it behind him.
The first prize in last year's Vodafone Company of the Year competition was awarded to Karel Žďárský, the owner of Farmet.
The jury then recognised the efforts he had made to turn a small tool factory in Česká Skalice into a company with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that this recognition has not only encouraged me but also all my staff and has strengthened our confidence in the fight against the competition", says the previous year's winner.
The history of Farmet began with the desire to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Žďárský a small workshop for rent as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists, he did not hesitate long, he left his career in the company where he was employed until then and founded his own company for the production of plastic pans with some of his father's comrades.
Soon after, they began to focus on vegetable oil pressing.
In 18 years they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in all of Central Europe.
But it was only through the success of the competition and its media coverage that it came to the attention of the general public.
"Not only is the Farmet brand now more widely recognised by our customers, but our foreign partners have also started to value the opportunity to work with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country", says Karel Žďárský.
Last year was not all about victory for Farmet.
The assessment was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tooling products.
The crisis, which at the time was affecting businesses more than citizens, was reaching its peak, with many firms being forced to suspend investment projects and to limit the purchase of new equipment and technology.
"We could not avoid this situation, of course".
"We lost 40% of our turnover, we had to reduce production and even to make redundancies", explains Karel Žďárský
A viable company must sometimes take such unpopular measures.
But it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black, although with lower profits than before the crisis.
One was that the company was not willing to cut back on investments in research and development.
"The grant helped us build a research and training centre, strengthen our presence at international trade fairs and win major prizes at domestic exhibitions", says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that we have overcome the crisis.
Turnover is growing again and with it the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner to enjoy the victory, but in a calmer atmosphere", says Žďárský.
A survey that clears up nonsensical regulations
The "Absurdity of the Year" poll is part of the Entrepreneurs' Competition for the fourth time.
Some of the rules that are so absurd have been eliminated.
The dubious winner of the next year's "absurdity of the year" poll was the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
More than one third of the less than four thousand voting entrepreneurs took this decision.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the Commercial Register, even though the official could have retrieved it with two clicks of the mouse.
Thanks to the opinion poll, that is changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the commercial register when checking social security payers", said Jana Buraňová, a spokeswoman for ČSSZ.
The purpose of the "absurdity of the year" opinion poll is to examine all the regulations and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to eliminate the nonsensical ones.
This is the fourth time this year that the competition has been organised by the Czech newspaper Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) and is gaining popularity among the public.
The Commission has already taken the necessary steps to ensure that the European Parliament is able to vote in the elections.
It is not surprising that there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve only to impede business activity.
"We are ranked first in the world in the number of income tax forms, for example", notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the declared objective of all governments in recent years.
However, the situation in the Czech Republic has not improved much compared with that in the rest of the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, down eight places from the previous year.
The absurdity of the year competition was first announced in and is held every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the closing of the competition at the end of September.
The competition organiser then selects seven candidates for the 'anti-prize' and lets the public vote online on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
This year's opinion poll has already registered more than a hundred, or more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and decrees.
The tips come not only from businessmen but also from trade associations and journalists.
The finalists of the competition include, for example, the payment of tolls for maintenance vehicles on motorways and expressways, or the provision of tolls for two-yearly maintenance for businesses with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The competition is announced at the beginning of November in Prague's Wenceslas Square, and is part of a happening that regularly involves personalities from political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were present at the height of the competition.
"Where the state throws a whip between the legs of the entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic upswing, so my aim is to remove at least thirty paragraphs every year that make it unnecessarily difficult for entrepreneurs to carry out their business", said Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade.
Efforts to eliminate meaningless arrangements from the world are having an effect.
In 2007, the most disturbing thing about the businessmen was the obligation to notify the Trade Office at their permanent establishment three days in advance of their intention to travel to an exhibition or fair with a display stand.
This obligation was abolished by an amendment to the Commercial Code.
The obligation to report to the employment office on official travel of employees for up to 30 days, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007, was abolished by the law on the so-called "green card".
And - all good things are three:
The absurdity of 2009 was the regulation that forced physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two scales in the consulting room.
This regulation was moderated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator requirement was dropped.
A new category recognises socially responsible companies
The evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A new feature in this year's fifth edition of the HN competition is the "Responsible Company of the Year 2010" category.
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the impact of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives", says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of Vodafon, the mobile operator who organises and guarantees this competition, as well as the Rebel of the Year competition.
This year's first year of this special subcategory of the main Vodafone Company of the Year competition saw the entry of companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The stories of each of them are extremely inspiring and provide enough material for a standalone article.
Although they differ diametrically in the subject of their work, their efforts have one common denominator - support and consideration.
This is for example the case with disabled people, personal problems or the health of one's own employees.
Among the 14 finalists from all over the Czech Republic, there was the Prague-based software company Et Netera, which promotes the formation of informal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in a wide variety of sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper mill in Poděbrady also takes an exemplary approach to disabled workers, who make up 70% of its workforce, and was awarded the title of 'Middle Bohemia Region's Responsible Company' and came third in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition for the region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, introducing, among other things, a fluid and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportional reduction in wages.
The jury also recognised the fact that the company buys mainly from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in its area and works on environmentally friendly principles.
"We try to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the environmental impact of our business and administration", explains Miluše Ryznarová, the company's managing director.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region, on the other hand, is concerned about the health of its employees and has therefore procured ergonomic chairs and keyboards for all laptops, as well as promoting homework for its employees and using cartering services provided by a local sheltered workshop for company events.
"We also support the 'People in Need' Foundation, which provides practical help to the local Roma community", says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
The activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbad region, which contributes to the pension insurance of its employees in the form of extra bonuses, is also worth mentioning.
"We pay our employees for meals, travel, training and holidays", says Josef Strapáč of the Bruntál-based construction company Czasch, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
All the regional finalists in the Vodafon Company of the Year competition were automatically entered in the Responsible Company of the Year category, who answered the questions in the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest.
The organiser excluded from the evaluation any incorrect or incomplete answers to the questionnaire.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they were excluded from the 'Responsible Company of the Year' competition, but they were not disqualified for that reason in the main 'Vodafone Company of the Year' competition".
"It is not possible to register for this competition alone, as it is a subcategory of the main competition, the Firm of the Year", explains Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in connection with a public tender
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police made arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate developer Luboš G. was taken away by the detectives in handcuffs.
The Commission notes that the Land of Bavaria had not provided any evidence to the Commission that the Land would have been able to pay the costs of the sale of the land.
This Luboš G. paid half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for the crime of fraudulent activities in a public competition", Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor's Office, told the newspaper "Právo", saying she could not provide further details in view of the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old businessman was released by the police.
The way in which he was able to manipulate public competition can only be speculated about in the light of the sparse official information.
The spokeswoman of the Land Fund, Lubomír Černá, responded to a question from Právo that the police had actually made arrests at the Land Fund's Pilsner branch during a public competition.
"It was a client and not one of our employees", she said.
According to Ms Černá, the public tender was properly called 'invitation to tender for the transfer of land according to the Land Act' and would take place in cases where several applicants showed an interest in the land offered.
'In the context of the call, these persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be paid by the transfer than the declared value of the land.'
"The order of potential buyers is determined according to the claims offered, and then the Land Fund transfers the property to the person with the highest bid", explains the Fund's spokeswoman.
Luboš G. had apparently information about who had applied for the invitation and, as he was himself an entitled person, having bought a number of entitlements to restitution, he offered to withdraw from the competition to a landlord.
Obviously for a fat settlement.
That would also explain why he was carrying such a large sum of money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had already had too good contacts with the Pilsner Soil Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the case of the former head of the Land Fund, Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for giving out land in replacement refunds, for which location decisions had already been made for construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. also acquired from the Land Fund land intended for the construction of public roads, more specifically, at the site where the construction of the access highway to the industrial area Borské pole was planned.
Later, he exchanged it very cheaply with the magistrate for a house right in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
The Town Hall had to make a small compromise at the time, so as not to jeopardize the construction project by blocking the land.
Household housing costs are rising by a few hundred a month
The budgetary situation will not only be affected by higher energy costs in January, but also by higher water and waste water bills, and by higher district heating and in some places rents.
Families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns more from their wallets each month from January onwards than they have in the past.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas 2 percent and more, and in some cities, water will cost up to a tenth more, and district heating will be more expensive in some places.
The electricity control alone costs the household several hundred crowns more each year.
The main reason for this is the significant promotion of electricity production from renewable sources, particularly photovoltaic plants.
Gas prices are only rising moderately, but this is happening at the time when people need to heat their homes the most and when they are consuming the most.
So here too, a few hundred crowns more per year can be expected.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from town to town.
Larger towns in particular are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kr. more per month for district heating from January, and more than 1000 kr. more per year for families in Liberec.
Prague residents, on the other hand, face 9 percent higher water and sewerage charges if the city raises infrastructure rent.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still one of the lowest in the Czech Republic.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewerage charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
For example, huge increases in rents are expected in 140,000 rental apartments, for which the so-called rent regulation will be abolished as of January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by 100% from January.
If anyone disagrees with this increase in rent, the company will take them to court.
The regulated rent paid today in nearly 300,000 apartments is expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech kids are getting drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, occasionally a good whiskey stolen from the father's bar.
These are the drinks that most Czech teenagers under 15 years of age need to go to the emergency room after drinking.
Children who have to repeatedly sleep their hangover in the hospital are no exception.
This is the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of children's wards of clinics.
"Beer or wine is completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk".
"The trend today is clearly hard alcohol", said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the chief of the pediatric department at the Central Bohemian Hospital in Hořovice.
"Whiskey, if you can sneak a bottle from the bar, and if not, at least Fernet or vodka.
"The vodka has the advantage of being mixed with juice, so it doesn't smell as strongly", explains the head doctor.
The spokeswoman for Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová, agrees with him.
"The most common are Fernet and Rum".
"This is the trend of alcohol today, especially in elementary schools".
"It was also about Slibowitz, who is taken away from home", said Ms Jurinová.
According to Dr. Pelikán, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the hospital are no longer an exception.
Before the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatric department of Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunken pupils from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times".
"Her career began at the age of 12 when she was first admitted with 3.5 per milliliter of alcohol in her blood and in combination with 'ecstasy,'" the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice at some dance party".
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't feel strange that her daughter hadn't come home for 48 hours", the head doctor wondered.
The lack of parental interest or their incredible tolerance for interference with their own offspring is considered one of the main causes of growing alcoholism in children.
Experts say that children are not really addicted.
"Alcoholism is a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all the phenomena associated with it, and this is not the case with these children".
"Those who drink alcohol repeatedly have a negative family and social background", explains Dr. Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman of the Motol hospital, Mrs. Jurinová, by mid-November, about forty drunk children had been admitted to the department of pediatrics and juvenile medicine.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home from outpatient treatment by their parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children drink a bottle of liquor in school, there are, according to Mr Pelikán, three seasonal amplitudes that are reliable: Walpurgis Night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either from grief over the bad record or from joy at the holidays".
"I have also seen seven drunken children in the room at the same time on Walpurgis Night", Dr Pelikán points out.
A drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who has to deal with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The morning after headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency can be relieved in the hospital by a fluid-supplying infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"They are clearly better off, because after the 'glorious' experience of the evening, they wake up in a good mood without any pain anywhere".
"They are just a little confused about where they are", admits Dr Pelikán, at least sometimes spoiling the good mood of the patients by listing the costs of treatment.
Because the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly to a few thousand crowns.
"Occasionally I have used this as a teaching tool, directly telling the children during the visit how much their drinking has cost them and that it can happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single party", Dr. Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance funds do not resort to recourse procedures to recover from the parents the costs necessary for the treatment of drunken children.
Two L-159 trainer aircraft in private hands for the first time - in Spain
Two L-159 light fighter aircraft, out of a total of five exchanged by the Czech Ministry of Defence for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city of Seville, home to the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS.
It's the first time machines of this type have been in the possession of a foreign army.
They have only been seen abroad during maneuvers or air shows.
The aircraft is a two-seat, airworthy version of the L-159T1 used by the Czech Army.
The other three aircraft are single-seat L-159s.
These are still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took them over last week.
When the planes will physically be dispatched from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, said, is not yet known.
The single-seat L-159 fighter aircraft, on the other hand, was removed from long-term storage, without any further investment by the Ministry's department.
"The two-seat L-159T1s were replaced in their current condition and appearance", Pejšek told the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army will not have to do without two-seat fighters, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four redundant L-159s into two-seat versions.
The army received a new aircraft in July, and the second one is due to be delivered by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to supplying the combat aircraft to one of the NATO countries.
'The contract clearly states that EADS is the customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are to be used for training pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer to decide how to realise the project", Pejšek said.
The HN newspaper had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner had been approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
The Ministry of Defence had not at that time issued a tender for the purchase, but had contacted EADS directly.
The Defense Department at the time argued that this exchange would support future export of the L-159 to foreign countries.
The Czech Army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it used only 24 and wanted to sell the rest.
The purchase of the Casa aircraft is also likely to have a legal consequence.
The European Commission took the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice, because it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not on the basis of a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, the last of which is due to land at Kbely Airport within 14 days.
A longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a longer index finger than a ring finger are clearly at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
It is thought that this is related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of fingers can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, particularly in men up to 60", said Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick and co-author of the study.
The finger could help determine which men should definitely be tested for prostate cancer, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health problems, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in the UK followed more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients, as well as 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had a right index finger shorter than the ring finger.
These men had the same risk of prostate cancer as 19 percent of men with the same ring and index fingers.
However, men whose index finger was longer than their ring finger had a 33- percent decrease in risk, and men over 60 had an 87 percent decrease.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are formed in prenatal age, evidently reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone is the equivalent of a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone in particular accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that he is only vaguely aware of the study, but that he does not believe the link between finger length and cancer risk has been "fully established".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is covered with snow on Thursday morning.
The roads and walkways are mostly covered with snow, and the winter workers have been on their feet all night in many places.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed because of some accidents involving trucks and cars, and the D1 is "closed" near Brno in the direction of Prague.
This was reported by Novinky.CZ to the dispatchers of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At kilometer 91, a truck crashed, at kilometer 93, two trucks collided, and there were injuries in this accident.
There's a couple of cars in the ditch, too.
There are also problems at kilometre 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Two trucks collided here, too.
Drivers should start just behind Brno at kilometre 190 or go through Brno and stop at kilometre 182 at the town of Kývalka.
Because that's where you get miles of traffic jams.
There was also an accident on the D11 and it was just at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself, a few inches of snow cover the city and the thermometer is reading minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, traffic jams are forming in the Prosek district, and the Štěrboholská street is completely clogged up.
The safest means of transportation is definitely the subway.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At 8 a.m. the Prague crisis team will meet.
There are also problems at the railway and airport.
The Czech State Railways had to cancel seven express train services due to snowfall.
There are problems, for example, on the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should be aware of the current situation.
The Ruzyně Airport has been closed since Wednesday at 11 p.m. to 5 a.m.
Most roads in the southern Moravia are only passable with increased caution.
Three side roads around Vyškov are completely impassable, snowdrifts are forming in places around Brno and in the area around Blansko, snowmelting is being forced on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three roads that are completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, snow removal will require the use of snow blowers.
When they will be operational again is still unknown.
In the Hodonín region, caution is advised in the White Carpathians.
The roads, which for conservation reasons can only be paved with inert paving material, are covered with snow up to five centimetres thick, ČTK said.
In the Czech Republic, snowfall was from two to ten centimeters, most of it in northern Bohemia - up to 18 centimeters in some places.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
But the snow is slowly disappearing in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon".
American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon, previously known only by its code name XM-25, for the first time in Afghanistan.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precise cannon.
Their projectiles are guided by lasers with a precision of only a few meters.
The special 25 mm caliber bullets developed for this rifle, which contain high explosive explosives, function practically as small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point along their ballistic trajectory.
That means you can use it against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle, like a wall or a trench.
Because it is usually not protected from above, the murderous steel-shard rain from above can easily knock it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who helped develop the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technology.
"This is basically what the soldier does: he locks on the target and emits a laser beam that determines the distance, then he gets an accurate sighting point, then he corrects the angle of elevation, then he just needs to pull back.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters".
"When you pull the trigger, the weapon will reload and fire the projectile at a distance of 1,700 feet plus or minus one, two, or three feet.
400 jobs are being relocated
The Fujitsu group is moving its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the existing office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is moving its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and computer maintenance giant announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move their workplaces from the former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt's Niederrad district, in July next year.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term, the new plant would accommodate another 100 jobs for the group, which had been spread over the region.
The rental offer was very attractive and the large offices in Astro Park would be more suited to the way the staff worked.
In Bad Homburg too Fujitsu had been merely a tenant.
The managing director responsible, Bernd Wagner, said: "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connections with the airport are of great importance to a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of a major company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The German government has also agreed to a new system of national taxes on the import of agricultural products.
This is a "great location scout".
Fujitsu is also a supporter of the city, and the settlement is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), expressed his regret at the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed of the intention early on by the management.
"We naturally offered our help to the company", Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic considerations would have prevailed.
The aim now is to prevent a long period of vacancy in such a prominent position.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative".
The building on Rathausplatz, which Fujitsu had previously occupied, and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were, along with the other buildings on Marienbader Platz, one of the most controversial construction projects in the city ten years ago.
A new city entrance was built between the station and the town hall as a joint project between the city and a private developer. The new entrance was criticized for the massive development of the areas previously used as a parking lot and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, investment advisory and rating firm Feri, software manufacturer for travel distribution systems Start Amadeus and the then still-affiliated computer manufacturer Fujitsu bought the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold one year later to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group describes itself as the world's third largest IT provider.
It provides companies with computers and servers, for example, and also provides the necessary services.
The branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has a much larger number of employees in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, where it is expected to have other subsidiaries, Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
The 20-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped layout - is home to the Central Association of the Electrical and Electronic Industries.
Amazon blocked server - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is getting into trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
It's possible that political pressure is behind this, after the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in England.
The whistleblowing platform Wikileaks is coming under increasing fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, is reportedly in Britain, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks is being pushed out of Amazon's servers".
"Free speech in the land of the free", the activists tweeted on Wednesday.
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
The internet activists had turned to Amazon Web Service (AWS) to manage the high numbers of access to the documents when publishing the secret diplomatic dispatches.
Wikileaks tweeted about the move: "Pretty good - our dollars are now being spent on employing people in Europe".
If Amazon has such a problem with free speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon has stopped Wikileaks from using its servers after staff members of Senator Joe Lieberman began investigating the matter, according to the Lieberman office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened to boycott Amazon, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I wish Amazon had taken this action earlier, given the previous releases of classified information by Wikileaks", the senator said.
The Commission has also proposed to extend the scope of the directive to cover the whole of the EU.
"Wikileaks' illegal, egregious and reckless actions put our national security at risk and endanger lives around the globe", the nonpartisan senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company - American or foreign - should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to disseminate stolen material".
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to a report in London's newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is in Britain, with Scotland Yard as the location.
The internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as a plot against his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls for the assassination of Julian Assange".
That is why Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The WikiLeaks founder will therefore remain in hiding.
Hrafnsson was obviously reacting to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had called for the man responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations to be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said - in apparent irony - on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
A battle of wills broke out between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently leaked spying calls to diplomats.
"I'm not sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website", Gibbs says.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than his one website".
The US government is now putting the protection of its databases to the test.
The White House said the deputy director of the Counterterrorism Center, Russell Travers, has been appointed as the special envoy.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that had become necessary following the disclosure of the embassy reports by WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to have the entire government's information sharing and protection systems reviewed.
The US government also announced that it would provide for the safety of dissidents and activists should they be put in danger by the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have made every effort to contact them", said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We stand ready to protect her if necessary".
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream makers are being prepared for better seasons.
The three-day Basic Course for Future Gelatieri has the largest attendance and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all this ice come from?
The gelatiere and the gelataio.
The gelatiere, or ice-cream confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice-making.
The gelataio uses a spatula to take the ice cream out of the fridge door, put it in the waffle and sells it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you can't miss the "Gelato University" by the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The University of Ice was established by the manufacturer of ice cream machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream produced by its machines everywhere lives up to the high Italian ideals.
The three-day course for future gelatieri has the largest attendance and visitors from all over the world.
There are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and internships in the company's own ice cream parlor.
Some people dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others simply venture on the slippery slope of their vague desires.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream in the future.
from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to make something of her own after years in a nerve-racking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and a man from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia is coming because her children love Italian ice cream.
The gelato master Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
The key is not just good taste but also silky smoothness and consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget the national and generally southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is also a lot of romance".
The first step to manufacturing seems very simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients - milk, cream, milk powder, sugar, and stabilizers - into a large blender, which uses an electronic program to heat the ingredients to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns on a tap on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all milk products.
The lecturer is immediately besieged with questions: Can ice cream be made with only natural ingredients without a stabilizer?
How can you let your own experimentation run free?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the spirit of the age.
Those who say that ice cream is "made from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar gum from guar beans.
Of course, you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, but you have to sell it within a day, otherwise it will shrink and the customer will eat ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are permitted.
The more exciting the flavors.
For the flavor of ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or the sweets in the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to sell you dozens of flavored additives".
"But you should just experiment".
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or ice cream, which is made from the white substance, which with eggs becomes yellow cream and with cocoa powder the basis of all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now, the students are allowed to go to the ice cream machines.
Luciano has them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha, and hazelnut ice cream, with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla flavoring or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also carried out on the fruit varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit puree - not necessarily better in taste.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn't necessarily taste more nutty if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by the working group, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a well-balanced mixture will bring out the flavor of a gelato, says Luciano.
The preparation is a calculation: if peach-puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream needs an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano pulls out a device that he uses to determine the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winegrowers use it to measure the oatmeal in the grape must).
Fortunately, spreadsheets make it easy to do the math.
Making ice cream doesn't require as much physical effort as it used to.
Not only the machine for the automatic production of the ground mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice-cream mixture is simultaneously whipped creamy and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all the automation, small breakdowns are not out of the question.
Brazilian Gustavo is stuffing himself and his classmates with pureed fruit from top to bottom when the oversized stick mixer gets out of hand.
"In any class", says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens".
Inspectors in the twilight
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is being infiltrated by the industry experimenting with genetically modified crops.
The group of experts on test biotechnology, which describes itself as an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology, is now making this objection.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have well documented it", Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have also been contracted by the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
It's paid for by corporations like Monsanto, Nestle, Bayer.
The Commission's proposal is to be based on the principle of subsidiarity, which is to be found in the Treaty on European Union.
The EFSA regulations were almost identical to ILSI's position papers, and thus represented the industry's handwriting, which was supposed to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It was the second time that Testbiotech had been short of a conflict of interest.
The Commission has also been asked to take account of the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment in the event of a serious accident at work.
The German public broadcaster MDR also recently revealed personal links between the EU's controlling authorities and the industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency and EU parliamentarians aware of the situation.
However, EFSA cannot see any conflict of interest.
The Commission's proposal is to make the data available to the public public more accessible to the general public, and to make it available to the public at large.
The experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contacts with industry.
But you would have to disclose them.
Kuiper is submitting his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the USA.
The Forum describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
Independent experts such as Then criticise the fact that genetically modified plants are currently approved without any feeding trials on animals and that the response of genetically modified plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what genetically modified maize is doing to the field", says Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins, not the whole plant, which does not give reliable results.
"If you don't look for risks, how are you going to find them?" asks Then, accusingly.
Angelika Hilbeck is the same way.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
The industry in this field, as in the USA, is now also increasingly trying in Europe to influence or discredit critical scientists.
There are therefore hardly any researchers left who are not linked to corporations.
Studies that are critical of companies are not usually published.
"Industry controls the security research", claims Hilbeck.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell has also gotten some, about 400 kilos in total.
On Monday evening he stood in front of Stuttgart station, the tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: In September, the excavators had moved in and started to cut a large section of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was not the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billionaire underground railway station.
By the time it was finished, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into six or seven thousand pieces.
Crailsheimer mussel limestone, a soft coarse stone, quarried between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's got some of the pieces.
"These stones are relics".
"They must not disappear".
He says: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy".
When he saw one, it smelled like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the bricks.
Stones have time.
So is Uli Gsell.
The Stuttgart Stones trail leads to a forest near Tübingen, a former munitions depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old is dealing in old stones.
He bought all the ones that were attacked during the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground into scrap metal or were disposed of in the landfill", he says in his office, a wooden hut that was once a guardhouse.
He was abused and threatened, he said, when it was reported in the newspapers in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything about the demolition.
And if it does happen, the most sensible thing would be to reuse the stones.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the quadrants, weighing on average 80 kilos, with a price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but some also hoping to return it in a rebuild.
500 tons of Rongen had been bought, 25 large truck loads.
About half of it's still in the woods, the rest is sold.
You know, gardeners, landscapers, home builders.
They had come from all over and had dragged away what the trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the bump have long since become "mills" or boundaries of herb beds.
"This stone is actually nothing special", says Rongen.
"Were it not for the political component".
He gets in his SUV, takes a tour of his 20-acre empire.
He studied law and dropped out, then biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone merchant.
And a lover of rocks.
It holds 40,000 tons of rock.
He's collecting his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest antique dealer in the Republic.
He brakes.
The snow is covered with sandstone carvings.
"They were once part of the Dresden Marienbrücke", he says.
Elbow sandstone, yellow, warm, it is swarming.
"My favourite stone".
It's the path up through the woods.
It shows a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And then on.
"Beautiful travertine, by the way".
The Quaders were part of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Stones and stories everywhere in the snow, canned travertine from the Stuttgart police station, red granite from the Cathedral of Saint Blaise, tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what toil, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones were carved by hand in the past and moved with simple bottle-pulling and ox-carts, he is filled with awe.
"It would be a scandal if you shredded something like that".
He hasn't gotten rich, let alone rock-rich.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, and up in the forest, there are also stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying", says the recycler.
He'll have to go to Cologne soon.
There are stones to be saved there, too.
Competition for high-potential talents
There's a lot of buffet action.
16 students are crowding each other for salmon buns, tomato soup and candy.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are asked to discuss the car of the future with VW developers - and to get to know Volkswagen in the process.
In the competition for the brightest minds, many companies are now competing head-on, like VW, in cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the auditoriums, before they enter the job market and are courted by others.
And because universities don't publish rankings of their students' performance, they try to spot and recruit exceptional talents in real-world projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car company is recruiting talent.
A young lady from the Human Resources Department is handing out ballpoint pens, rubber bands, and folders with VW logos.
She talks to the hopeful young talents about internship programmes and student jobs and shows them the way in the company.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is supervising the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students get in touch with industry and gain experience".
"VW can meet students, look at interesting candidates and think about who might be a good candidate for the job".
Such collaborations, as Selle has, are not uncommon.
It's new that students are being bullied so aggressively.
"Otherwise, the emphasis would be on the technical project", says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates is about to get even tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large pool of applicants.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a report on the implementation of the programme.
The graduates of engineering disciplines in particular are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering jobs were unfilled in October.
And the so-called engineering gap is forecast to widen even further.
For the auditing and consulting firm KPMG, Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a modern scavenger hunt in which participants must find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students are on their way to the company to send across the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can visit KPMG branches and get to know the company.
The winner is chosen in two rounds of preliminary voting.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the United States.
As the university's high-potential students are hounded and beaten, the guns are getting bigger, according to Dykta.
"We want to make the race stand out from the crowd".
"We couldn't afford a simple sail turning".
It looks like talent scout Dykta is on the mend.
"We are in contact with all participants in a similar action last year".
"Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon", he says.
In addition to the direct on-campus activities, small and medium-sized enterprises in particular also participate in the traditional trade fairs.
"We're trying to reach alumni at trade shows".
"It's like being on the Intersolar", says Sitha Stübe, human resources manager at the solar technology company Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs some 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of the young.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company website.
"It's very difficult to fill vacancies at the moment".
"It takes a lot of time and money", she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give you instructions that you can do an internship or write your thesis with us".
Expensive promotions are not on the books at the solar specialist.
The company is trying to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"This is something that a large company often cannot offer", says Stübe, the head of human resources.
Money is no longer the main factor in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career prospects are other factors.
Solarworld was ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
It asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their work environment and looks at the conditions surrounding the employees.
The recruitment manager, Stübe, hopes that the placement will also give her a positive impression on jobseekers.
"I think that applicants are looking for external evaluations about a potential employer", she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as employers with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Krieger, primarily internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your employees", he says.
In industry jargon, this is called internal employer branding, i.e. employer brand formation within one's own workforce.
"Happy employees are the best ambassadors".
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, they would automatically promote their employer to friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing with a gang", says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
No new oil drilling will be carried out in the coming years off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Washington administration has issued a ban on the use of the drug, effectively reversing its earlier plans.
New drilling off the Atlantic coast will also be prohibited for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in April.
Before the accident, which killed 11 workers and led to the worst environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents of the idea claim that it would reduce the United States' dependence on foreign oil supplies.
Who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf remains a mystery.
The British energy company BP, which faces billions in claims, is at the centre of the criticism.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama is due to present its findings in the course of December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, several oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security, Obama and Salazar want to avoid another disaster.
The competent control authority, which has been discredited by numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing a major reform.
In parallel, Obama has announced plans to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the amount of production in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it is today if regulation were tightened.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry", said a recent industry survey by consulting firm BDO - even before Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation".
Investment in new projects would be delayed until further notice - to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The rivers are oil-brown, and the smell of the gas station is that of billions of gallons of spilled crude oil that have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoni.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari is well-meaning.
"Don't be late", the environmental activist reassures the journalists, "you'll be getting enough oil sludge in front of the lens today".
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been trying to photograph a boy who is up to his chest in the water with the eyes surrounding him: the scene is almost beautiful in the rainbow-colored water glow.
It is not visible that brown swords of crude oil float beneath the surface.
Esther Badom, who lives on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River, says that she used to collect shrimp by the bucket.
Meanwhile, the idle flowing waters were completely dead.
Five years ago, a massive amount of crude oil spilled into the vast wetlands from a burst pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach the fish-rich waters: Ogon Island, in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst-affected regions in the world.
The full extent of the destruction becomes apparent as we drive through the mangrove swamps that are dragged by the rivers.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat is pouring brown broth, and those who plunge their hand into the water are pulling out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise like black liquorice sticks from the ground, leaving sadly the sprigs of the occasional palm tree hanging.
The usual bird-squads of the wetlands are in vain: as soon as the outer border is silent, a haunting calm settles over the former paradise that smells like a gas station.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare", says Celestine Akpobari gloomily: "We are living in constant health danger".
The comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement is a battlefield that has been fought for decades: here, more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe entered, here, in the 1980s, the first resistance was organized with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here, in 1993, the Shell Group had to stop its production because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
The company is still denied the right to return to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with over 5000 wells and 7000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, the Group's situation is too unstable.
Every few hundred yards, steel scaffolding stands out like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are the heads of the boreholes, called far too tenderly.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the core.
Again and again, says Akpobari, such a wellhead breaks apart, and a steady stream of crude oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that over the past 50 years, more than two billion gallons [billion gallons] of oil have been released into the delta's ecosystem - the same amount of oil that was released into the sea off Alaska during the Exxon Valdez supertanker accident 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
The question of who is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU is disputed.
While Shell Corporation blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see bursting drilling heads and leaking pipelines as the main culprits.
The US scientist Richard Steiner accused Shell in 2008 of having much lower safety standards in Nigeria than elsewhere in the world, and of having a "many times higher" rate of pipe failure than elsewhere.
In a place that looks like a deserted, oil-smeared open-air workshop, figures emerge from the mangroves, naked and covered in oil up to their necks.
Under one of the many barrels, some connected by pipes, some scattered about the site, a fire is burning: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group's manager.
First, gasoline enters the intake tank through the pipes, later, kerosene drips out at the end of the pipe, and finally, diesel.
So Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300-liter diesel daily: "This brings us 34,000 naira" - about $22 US.
The delta people are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal boilers can still undercut the ridiculously low price of diesel at just under 40 cents per litre, because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who tap into the pipeline network across Ogoniland, which according to experts, causes the country to lose at least 16 million litres of crude oil a day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a very small part of the raw materials stored in temporary storage are illegally extracted: the lion's share is filled in tankers by organized criminal networks, which are supposed to include politicians and high-ranking military officers, and then scattered on the world market.
The debate over whether the environmental disaster is due to the population's vagaries or the lax production methods is considered by the activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the fishermen's livelihood, there would be no sabotage, no theft, and no illegal refineries".
The Ogoni's relationship with Shell, in particular, has been so badly damaged that the company's only option is to withdraw, saying that "perhaps other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will be better off".
That makes Michael nervous.
"It's time for you to go", says the muscular oilman.
"The soldiers may arrive any minute".
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special forces unit, they are not threatened with arrest, but with a painful bribe.
The soldiers, who are mainly from the north, also want to profit from the raw material, as do all Nigerians.
"This damned thing has brought our country to the dogs in every way", says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous design flaws in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major safety problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible design flaw in a downed machine that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas is now suing the engine manufacturer.
Passengers on the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were apparently much luckier than they had been: The Australian Aviation Safety Authority has identified a major safety issue with the engines of some A380 aircraft in its investigation - and is now warning of a possible design flaw.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, said an ATSB statement published on Thursday.
This could have led to "catastrophic engine failure".
The Commission's investigation was initiated in the context of the investigation of the case of the A380 aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which made an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It filed a plea in an Australian federal court in Sydney, which will allow it to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
The engine fire had loosened parts and damaged the bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce blamed the oil spill for the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines worldwide will need to be replaced.
Australian investigators announced that they would conduct further safety tests on the Superjumbo equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety issue was considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas plane made an emergency landing, the airline had grounded its A380 fleet for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded about three of its 11 A380s.
Lufthansa changed the engine on an A380 as a precaution.
The double-decker plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Snowfall causes traffic chaos
Germany in white: Almost the entire country has been snowed over overnight.
Many roads are in chaos, trains and flights are cancelled.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter is freezing in Germany: With freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is snowed in on Thursday night - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, some areas are covered with snow that is up to six inches (15 cm) thick.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in constant use, but was not able to cope with the constantly new snow.
Moreover, violent storms swept over the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal.
In Saxony, snowfall caused considerable problems on motorways and federal roads.
According to the weather station Meteomedia, the Saxon Switzerland was therefore on the alert at the highest level ever.
Some had a foot of snow, and fresh winds caused some to be swept away.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there overnight.
Police authorities in Saxony-Anhalt also reported major disturbances on the roads.
On the A2, snow and wind caused traffic jams and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there will be significant disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails, or destroyed overhead lines and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance services from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be discontinued.
In the Thuringian town of Saalfeld, an ICE train had to stop in Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided with wool blankets, food and drink by firefighters and rescuers on the train.
Snow-winds swept over the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds cause numerous flight cancellations.
A spokeswoman for the Munich air traffic control center said that some cancellations have already been reported.
A Fraport spokeswoman said that 40 flights had already been cancelled in Frankfurt.
The winter service is on permanent duty.
The Commission has not yet received any information on the amount of the compensation.
Many roads were hit by accidents as early as Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed when it collided with a train at a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The train driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg, Germany, where a truck was caught in a railway crossing because of snow on the road.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which closed the line from Bayreuth to Nuremberg until the early hours of the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she ran over a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
The good news, though, is that the snow will still be loose and powdery, so it will swirl even with light showers.
But the wind will be less.
Only the Baltic Sea is plagued by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally down to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank is looking to part with its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the bank is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring in up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just finished redecorating its headquarters: the twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district have been modernized; meanwhile, bankers have been allowed to return to their old jobs.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recoup the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
The reasons for the planned sale were not mentioned by the spokesman.
"We are always looking at whether it makes more sense to own property or to sell and then rent it back", he said.
Germany's largest credit institution is thus selling its headquarters after a short time.
The bank had only taken over the twin towers in mid-2007 from investors in an in-house fund for EUR 272 million and had subsequently extensively renovated them.
The energy conversion cost is estimated at around 200 million euros.
I think a sale would bring the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers, which have now been renamed "Greentowers", at about 500 million euros, according to the newspaper.
The question of whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor was still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn for dead buddies
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought about the buried miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies have still not been recovered because the safety situation in the accident shaft remains precarious.
Less than two weeks ago, a massive explosion occurred at the Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
Twenty-nine miners, ranging in age from 17 to 62, were buried underground.
A probe had been lowered into the sinkhole, but had found no sign of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue workers were unable to descend for safety reasons.
After the second blast, authorities and experts had concluded that the buddies had no chance of survival.
The bodies have not been recovered.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people had gathered in Greymouth, New Zealand's South Island, under the bright sun.
They're silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were set up, with helmets, lamps, and the names of the buddies on them.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place.
Flags were flown at half-mast in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would "come up from the depths of the earth" to the surface, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the commemorations.
"But they never came home".
He could not be satisfied with his son's death until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the memorial service.
The first explosion on 19 November had also spilled British and South African miners.
Rescuers began to put out a fire inside a coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Once the explosive gases have been expelled, work will begin to cool the searing temperatures inside the mine, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you, warrior!
Is Splatter a good fit for the art house?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is pushing back the boundaries of the genre with his epic "Walhalla Rising".
What kind of audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have had in mind when he made "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and, with almost superhuman powers, takes down his opponents in succession - sounds ideal for young male audiences looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and already tears his enemies' intestines out of the living when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, says nothing about the whole film, and the other characters also let themselves be dragged to a sentence or two or a few agonizing death cries.
Otherwise, they will be quiet and revel in the eerily beautiful hills of Scotland, which provides the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for more adult filmgoers with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera work.
It's nice to have multiple audiences, but it's a shame if they're mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylized drug-dealing trilogy "Pusher", but stoically refuses to make his works with a little more humor mainstream or a little less brutality accessible to the arthouse.
Most art-cinema friends would be put off by the brain matter and the guts sprinkled around.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when Einauge, for reasons that can be interpreted freely, sets off with a troop of violent Christian missionaries by ship to Jerusalem and gets stuck in fog and fog forever before the crew apparently arrives in America and there continues to remain silent.
No wonder "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
This is particularly unfortunate because of the splendid pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-curdling facade there is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot, it's all atmosphere, a fever dream made into a film.
And there is no escape for the viewer.
Refn gives him hardly a moment of relaxation and slowly strangles his throat with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the unimaginable hatred that beats against him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy, who stands by faithfully, preserves something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who, to enemies and temporary allies, eventually becomes a warrior from hell, perhaps the devil's own messenger.
It means doom, but perhaps only for the already damned.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mystery film that can be hated and admired, to the anger, to the excitement, to the wonder.
It was an experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is reluctant to take a position on this - nor does it allow for controls.
At around midnight on the 5th and 6th of September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attack a mysterious cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is on the banks of the Euphrates River; the nearest major city, 20 miles [30 km] away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents regarding the reactor that Syria allegedly built with North Korean help in the Quad, hidden in a valley that runs off the river.
According to a CIA briefing in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby town of el-Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium, which would be used to make nuclear weapons.
For other purposes, however, the technology of the 1950s is hardly suitable.
The CIA was presenting a video presentation with a few satellite images that were not clear.
Using computer animation, they were able to see where the components of the reactor were before it was destroyed, which was a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also submitted photos showing the building up close, or even the interior.
The reactor was close to being commissioned, it was said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, little is known about the incident, and the mystery has grown over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoir that before the attack, the CIA was quite sure that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but saw little evidence that the country had "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some European intelligence officers prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of an "alleged reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation to be "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, and so does the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat replied in the summer with a simple lapidary that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
Although the ruins of the supposedly "unused military building" were hurriedly cleared, the Syrians thoroughly planned the site.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
The IAEA also received satellite images from commercial suppliers, via one Member State, from the period immediately after the attack, which are likely to be more telling than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it has never had a secret nuclear programme or built a reactor.
The uranium was from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA rejected that as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as the satellite images.
It also denies inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the rubble of the bombed-out building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this", Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
The investigation into the case has been dragging on since June 2008 and is "increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area overseen by the IAEA.
Key to progress in the investigation, the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor - and that otherwise still exist.
The inspectors have not yet revealed the type of equipment, its function or what makes it suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are referred to internally by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, each derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) has identified these sites and identified a building complex in Masyaf on satellite imagery, which is most likely one of the suspected objects.
It may be located in or adjacent to a military base - for this very reason Syria denies the IAEA access to the three sites.
In Vienna, they say the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA was sent by the US to spy on military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had been tipped off by US intelligence about the facilities.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material was being transported back and forth between the three locations and the Euphrates Quadrant.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
But there is "no indication of any sensitive activities", i.e., uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary to build nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with unenriched uranium.
But where the uranium was to come from and where the plutonium for the bomb was to be extracted from, these central questions are at least plausible guesses.
It is also unclear whether any debris that could contain valuable traces was stored at the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads of rubble had disappeared from the earth, no one wants information about where the rubble has gone.
The Salzmine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which was investigated by Syria in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste repository, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite imagery for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But footage from orbit shows Syria conducting excavations at the three suspected sites and removing large containers after the IAEA requested access.
That may be a coincidence, but it didn't help to clear up the suspicion.
Diplomatic sources also say that the IAEA spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - the effort alone shows how much the inspectors' interest is.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
The Commission has also been asked to take account of the fact that the nuclear power plant in Vienna is being built in the United States, and that the United States has been involved in the construction of the reactor in Vienna for a number of years.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but he is still hesitant.
There are risks involved in this: firstly, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented there are far from eager for escalation.
Secondly, as one diplomat put it, "What if they end up with nothing?"
Love in the Time of War
Since Angelina Jolie started work on her as-yet-unnamed directorial debut this summer, there's been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
Little else is known about it - but that is enough to cause concern.
The rumour persists that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, which led to some of the filming scheduled in Sarajevo being moved to Hungary.
Now the film is shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it's still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of female war victims wrote to Jolie about the UN refugee agency UNHCR and requested a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself an ambassador of the UN refugee agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary a few weeks ago, but they declined.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
I've heard that there were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims tells you enough about the script.
Her organization has recommended that the UN Refugee Agency remove Jolie from her position as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was able to read her script, has, after some back and forth, granted permission for filming in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author herself insists that she has no political intentions with her film, that she has worked hard to get involved in the Yugoslav conflict, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
The content of the report is, however, vague.
A second synopsis of the film is circulating on the Internet, which sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which is a lot different than the "Rape Victim Falls in Love with Torture" version.
Jolie's movie actually starts before the war, that's for sure.
The pressure on them, Jolie said, was "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now, the only thing that can bring you peace is the Hollywood hackers, by illegally uploading the script, as so many have done before.
♪ There's no place like home ♪
Tonight, the Irish are finally getting it right.
No sign of grief.
But the home team is too dominating its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
The fans are cheering, their feet are stamping, and the music is loud.
The Bailey Pub in South Cork is buzzing as players throw ping-pong balls into beer cans over a three-metre distance - and hit.
Beerpong is the bizarre spectacle, and the winner gets 500 euros and a flight to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; that shrill drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, that doesn't really go together.
Yet the 26-year-old is trying to have fun, distracting himself from the burning question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to gamble in Las Vegas, he's going to New Zealand in January to conduct interviews.
"I have a mixed feeling about it", he says.
"It's so far from home and I still don't have a job there".
After all, his girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a dream job as an event manager, maybe a good sign", says the young man, smiling.
With the prospects at home so bleak, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their fortune abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go, "It's like the Tanners in a lot of families on the island".
The European Union is also working to improve the living conditions of the poorest people in the world.
They expect up to 200,000 immigrants by 2015.
For the small country of only 4.5 million people, this is a huge loss.
If the forecasts are correct, we will see a wave of emigration similar to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of prosperity that brought great prosperity to Ireland, sadness is once again on the rise.
The economic crisis is particularly unsettling to the young, well-educated Irish, who have so far been on the upswing.
Job loss and social degradation seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was plentiful.
But now three out of every ten women and men under 30 are out of work.
The Irish Times is full of letters from young expatriates complaining that "everything is going to hell in Ireland".
"There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, go away and our country loses a whole generation".
"Last one to turn off the light, please".
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a bleak future ahead as the government is eye-washing and giving young people no prospects.
"They are reducing the minimum wage, but they don't have a strategy for how to create new jobs", says the 20-year-old.
She watches her classmates swing from one unpaid internship to the next.
She says that her biggest fear is that in four years' time she will have to emigrate herself.
"That thought is sad and depressing".
And men like Stephen McLarnon try to put a positive spin on the subject.
McLarnon organises the 'Working Abroad Expo', a trade fair which provides a round-the-clock service on the topic of working abroad.
"For a new job, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder", says the manager.
His website features photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Sean O'Donovan has known for six months what it feels like to build something elsewhere.
Because there was nothing for the 29-year-old engineer to do in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction sites in Germany.
They're blowing up a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, we'll go to Hannover or Berlin for the next project.
O'Donovan rarely sees his home country anymore, because he's working overtime to pay off the mortgage on his home.
"The situation is a little crazy", he says as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time in a long time.
"I'm earning money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'll be in for the rest of my life".
He laughs a little, and walks through the cool rooms.
The small house is in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, and large, expensive cars parked in the driveway.
O'Donovan, along with a sister, bought the house for 380,000 euros four years ago - 100 percent loan financing.
"Those were crazy times, there was easy money, no questions asked", he says.
Is he worried about the credit card being a bust?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, pouring hot tea, and says, "I have no children to feed, and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over".
The civil engineer doesn't like the wailing he hears so often these days.
"No one has to go hungry - our situation is not as dramatic as it was in the past here on the island", he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - it may make us feel Irish".
He laughs and then tells me about his father, who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back, and life in Ireland went on, quite simply".
Cian Tanner likes the idea.
Let's just leave the future open and see how life is going elsewhere.
He's had a few years of work in London, and why shouldn't he and his girlfriend have a good time in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that worries him right now: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it might turn into a going-away party.
"Don't let your emotions get in your head", he says, taking a big sip of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds scary".
"Let's call it a get-away party, just a little casual, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games".
The democratic routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is growing stronger, as is the support for private enterprise.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These are the findings of the Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus reflects the change in opinion in this region.
Two facts stand out in this year's survey, which was conducted in September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America.
And second, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions.
In many countries on the Pacific coast of South America, the democratic movement has grown strongly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where the economy has been growing at about 6% a year since 2002, the number of pro-democracy voters has risen from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Mexico, too, is seeing a similar trend, as the economy recovers from last year's sharp decline.
However, only half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, lower than the regional average (see Chart 2).
Some 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice in their country, the same as last year but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
Some 34% trust their country's Congress and 45% trust their government, both figures are the same as last year but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts to build more democracy.
This continued during the global economic crisis, possibly because Latin American countries experienced only a brief recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were hooked up to a stronger social network.
(According to UN Economic Commission for Latin America reports this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and has fallen again by 32% this year.)
But there are wide differences in mood from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crime has increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the survey began, many respondents in Latin America see crime as a bigger problem in their country than unemployment (see Figure 5).
About 31% say that they or a family member have been the victim of a crime in the last year, but this is down from 38% last year, the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support for the private and market economy: around 71% of respondents across the region indicated that the private sector is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% said that only the market economy could bring progress to their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are in favour of a private economy), despite the fact that its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, has nationalized many private companies.
Brazil has the largest share in the region, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, on the other hand, see the US as the most influential country, with the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua being taken over by Venezuela.
A ballot box
Nobody expected the November 28th elections in Haiti to be perfect.
But the facts far outweighed the fears of the election workers who rushed to the aid of the battered country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballots in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, many of whom were left homeless by the January earthquake, were roaming about looking for an alternative.
Some eventually gave up altogether.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some of the presumed frontrunners, demanded the annulment of the election results due to alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests all over the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "quite good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is reportedly committed to the unpopular departing president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected election is scheduled for January.
There's still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rapper Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuits.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no support among the electorate, is declared the winner of the by-election by the electoral commission, this could cause problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims are still living in tents, there were fears of a low turnout.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by a lack of organization.
Shortly before the election began, about 250,000 ID cards needed to vote had not been distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized government to be an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitian people themselves share the same view.
Stealthy in the middle
In the weeks following her husband's sudden death, Argentina's President Cristina Fernández experienced a surge of sympathy that boosted her popularity by 20 points to over 50%, the highest since her election in 2007.
Whether this will help her re-election next year, however, depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more compromising than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who continued to direct economic policy after his wife's election, often drew up budgets which did not take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the pair of presidents to spend the extra revenue at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided, and Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27 has led to further disruption.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronists sided with Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (one parliamentarian punching another in the face and others accusing the government of corruption), the Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss it", said the President.
The 2010 budget now extends to next year, giving the president even more leeway to spend money at her own discretion.
The economy is hot: it will probably grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but many private estimates - and union wage demands - put the figure at almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 as Argentina was wracked by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to be his main goals, not reducing inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then purged the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate approach?
She has called for talks with the private sector and union leaders.
And according to official statements, next year's wage increases are to be capped at 18%.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy.
However, inflation undermined the growth spurt with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Cristina Fernández wants to bring Argentina back into the world financialally.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had rejected the country's previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for a deal with the Paris Club's donors, to whom she owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused to allow the IMF to verify their claims, as is the practice elsewhere.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical assistance" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like the first step in cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will continue to be politically active after her term ends without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has had enough of Kirchnerism for the most part.
When the Argentinians return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy that has been directed at her will have faded.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to quietly overturn many of her husband's political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly moving closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the Strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of the total electorate, turned out to elect mayors and city councillors in the five boroughs, a measure widely seen as a measure of President Ma Ying-jeou's power.
By building groundbreaking business relationships, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of mainland relations, and his policies have, for the first time since 1949, permanently changed the relationship with the Chinese mainland.
Ma passed the exam, but only by a narrow margin.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) provides three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence for Taiwan, received almost 50% of the vote, while the KMT received 45%.
If it was a presidential election, it would have been a problem for Ma.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the KMT in the city councils.
The election was marred by the usual Taiwanese-style events, including truck convoys of rioters, flag-waving mass processions, and scantily clad dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate, Sean
When a man in the crowd shot him in the face, injuring Lien and killing a bystander.
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to DPP leader Tsai Ing-wen, the attack has affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which has given the KMT more votes.
China may have been the biggest beneficiary of the campaign.
It is noteworthy that the mainland relations were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwanese people love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
But this time, the DPP also avoided stirring up anti-Chinese sentiment too much.
It was a response to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of using economic incentives to lure Taiwan back into the Community.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals in this area.
It's better to wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated for absolute independence.
But under Tai's rule, a new generation of moderate politicians has emerged, and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the working class and the youth.
Tsai was the presidential candidate of the DPP, and was highly popular, as was Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
The Commission is now doing everything it can to show that it too is capable of building close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans to have a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this requires open-minded discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a 'trustworthy alternative' to Ma's rapid rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he declared that the DPP candidates had done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
The Commission has also been asked to take action to ensure that the Community's financial instruments are used effectively.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is struggling to pick its possible candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Values are poor, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-widening gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will reshape his cabinet and local institutions.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only partially in favour of rapprochement.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to prominent columnist Antonio Chiang, "there is no going back".
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded the Newcomer of the Year category
If you're doing it at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony, and the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was surprisingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination seems a bit unusual, but it does fit the Grammy rules, which state that an artist may have released no more than three albums before the release of the album that made him known to the general public.
Her 2010 album, Chamber Music Society, is certainly a step forward, and with her powerful voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding is easily compared to Norah Jones 2003, whose 2003 big-time success as a jazz performer comes closest to Spalding's nomination in that category.
The Vijay Iyer Trio's album Historicity was also nominated in the Instrumental category, making this critically acclaimed album a huge success.
Among the competitors of Iyer are "Moody 4B" by the experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by the keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the Contemporary Jazz category, which is more about albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of savage steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the big band category, competing against the Billy Childs Emsemble with its chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octave, whose life album "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical categories
The nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
Leading the list is Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and five-part orchestra, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
The classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, ranging from orchestra, opera, choral to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, Bergs' "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses' "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos' "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins' "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra and Choir; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales were nominated.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for Deus Ex Machina, Hans Werner Henze for Appassionatamente Plus, Magnus Lindberg for Graffiti, and Shchedrin for The Enchanted Wanderer, all of which were nominated for a Grammy.
Part's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded on January 4 at Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is serving a prison sentence in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline Concerto" was nominated in the category of solo instrumental with orchestra.
The L.A. composer claimed that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin player Avi Avital, who was performing the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and many North African sounds and rhythms", Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
The conductor, Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for a recording of Stravinsky's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The instrumental soloists were the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, only female vocalists were nominated, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical crossover, the soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Temecula mosque wins approval from planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula was unanimously approved by the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated, public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But according to a statement from the commission late Wednesday, the new religious center will meet local regulations and will be an aesthetic highlight.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Baha'is, and many others", Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"As an American, I'm proud of that".
"It shows that justice prevails".
"There are few opponents", he added.
"They're just very loud".
"This valley is full of wonderful people".
The meeting began at 6:00 p.m., and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted until almost midnight, with the votes on both sides distributed fairly evenly, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America", one comment read.
"It's another planet of apes, and the Statue of Liberty lies dead in the sand".
"America is finished".
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for non-violence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger, better place than the warehouse they'd rented with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new mosque, about 2,300 m2 in Mediterranean style, is to have two minarets and be about 13 m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot of land on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still file a complaint with the city council against the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could provide new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien bacterial species that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, they believe that it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered necessary for life.
"This organism has two options".
"It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow".
"This makes it very special, even though it is almost a kind of 'alien' life form", said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appears in the online Thursday edition of the journal Science.
Until now, six basic elements have been considered essential to life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
But scientists have found that the bacteria in Mono Lake, California, continue to grow even after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible", said co-author Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must identify life and its forms, Anbar said.
The study is looking at microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were revealed, led to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report might be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms in other planetary systems can use other elements to set in motion biochemical processes and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely necessary for life are not necessarily fixed", said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes, in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is novel in that it shows that one element can be replaced by another in basic biochemical processes and structures", added Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she thought that microbes exposed to both might be able to replace one element with the other.
"The main reason arsenic is toxic is that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus".
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another".
"But the difference is so great that arsenic acts differently from phosphorus, and it enters our biochemical system, where it smudges almost everything", explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increased concentration of arsenic, and it adapted and grew.
So while the microbe grows better in phosphorus, the fact that it can survive in arsenic also shows that arsenic-based life forms can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea of substituting arsenic for phosphorus is not new, but there has been no working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This suggests that life may have evolved differently from the early Earth age", says Forster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simons' research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy, and the National Institutes of Health.
The rest of the stolen show dogs found in Compton.
The remaining two of the four show dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's office Thursday.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when unknown persons stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express-Van in which the animals were housed for the night in front of a Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were spotted Wednesday afternoon, and the last two were spotted Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine", says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape".
"They have been returned to their rightful owners".
Whitmore did not provide details on the location of the dogs or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing".
"We don't want to say anything more", Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads".
The owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were unavailable for comment on Thursday.
They took their two dogs in on Wednesday afternoon at a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed, authorities said.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, which Rickard and Peek were planning to present at the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, were missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was supposed to be competing.
As Peek's Times reported Wednesday, the other dogs were scheduled to compete in other competitions in the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple's nearly month-long tour of dog shows.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stayed in motels and parked their van outside their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer, a Parson Russell Terrier, and a Brittany - to their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek promised a reward to anyone who could give him a clue to the Corgis, and the animals were implanted with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was still not clear whether a finder's fee would be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a fresh start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially approved the Gleibe's "pre-packaged" plan to pay off the company's $5 billion debt and clear the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to launch new movies and TV shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so there is nothing to stop MGM from rebooting under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320 people.
For MGM, Chapter 11 does not actually take effect until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to fund the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of investment banks, which is itself contributing $75 million, is running the company.
The studio's restructuring began in May 2009 with the mandate to help the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management company, which was struggling with interest payments of $300 million/year, solve its financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and restructuring expert best known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to resolve MGM's financial woes and pay off the studio's more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to put the company up for sale at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started over again when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which after months of debate and internal disputes was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM has officially emerged from bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month to run the company, will receive a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which has released only one film this year and has a seven- or eight-film annual schedule to hit theaters in early 2012.
They also plan to make two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio will need a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the latest negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite gift is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console, both of which can make a considerable dent in your gift budget.
An iPad costs the same as five BMX bikes for $99, while the price of a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in my search for three electronic toys under $80, I went to three national toy stores -- Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club.
I realized right away that Moore's Law had been put into effect, and this year, the technology toys are more powerful and also a little bit less expensive than last year.
And while fewer new toys appear with their own website, the most popular of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have a wider range.
More and more button-cell toys are being launched, many with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some suggestions.
(All prices quoted are Toys "R" Us unless otherwise stated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children 3 and up) are plush figures the size of guinea pigs that sing a note when pressed on their bellies.
A single tap is a note, and a song can be played by pressing it several times.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs singing in harmony
Warning: Once you start pushing, you cannot stop.
For a combination of dance and song, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children 2 and up) is the best choice.
Based on Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interactive games like "Simon Says", and thanks to its new-fangled wheel-locked hinge feet, it dominates the Moonwalk.
Kids who tested the device used Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you probably remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for children 3 and up), with a whole bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with a self-correcting know-it-all as the teacher.
If you don't want to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60 for 3-8 year olds) is the cheapest and easiest solution, with a qwerty keyboard, but the games included are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70 for 3-12 year olds), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrogs' first major overhaul of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90 for children 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children 8 and up), which is a five-block block no bigger than a matchbox and has its own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before the clock runs out, and it's great for an improvised spelling bee.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores by yourself, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online pet at Club Penguin, you can purchase a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children ages 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits to purchase two more pieces in the Club Penguin Store.
It could be roller skates or a puffle-toffle.
The latest head-cell-powered micro-robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children 5 and up) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he can take a lot of things.
Our one fell off the kitchen table and even survived for a while in our dog's mouth.
Police operations in China are becoming more gentle
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked across a city square, checking his nervous subordinates, issuing orders with military authority and a muted voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's tough guardians of urban order, feared and despised for their indiscriminate raids and penchant for violence - to impress the audience.
"Stand up now!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them", he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely teenagers, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and trousers stood up tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held in blue and white striped loops.
"To me they look average", Mr. Tang says contemptuously.
"Models are pretty".
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a college degree.
Guangdong Province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the gray green.
In Wuhan, central China, violence was replaced by a low-key riot: in 2009, 50 officials reportedly stared at a food truck that had been improperly parked, and the operator, until after half an hour, he packed up and left the square.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with a population of 680,000, wants to change the image of the city.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the city's police force, chosen specifically for their looks, good figure and youth.
They're supposed to give the rude police a softer, more feminine look.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would not be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Right, according to the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce city laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely portrays a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei province beat a spectator to death after he filmed them with his cell phone as they crushed a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing officials was stolen and posted online, describing how to beat up criminals without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a hand-to-hand combat with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained Chinese officials attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan is scaring the government", the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "really thorough clean-up".
Skeptics find the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the district advertised for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real duties or were just meant to be a visual distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 with good body and "harmonious features" were sought.
They should be above average height - over five feet, two and a half inches.
The employment relationship ends when the person reaches the age of 26.
According to the officials, the work is too physically demanding for women over 25.
"The most important thing is their image", an unnamed district official told the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether candidates get the job depends first on their appearance, such as height, weight, facial features, etc".
Then there is temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases", he said, adding, "but they have other duties besides that".
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's municipal administration, would not agree with this description,
But admitted that in China, height is not unusual for both sexes in job advertisements.
The same is true of uniform facial features.
Whether this is the same as good looks is a matter of contention in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disorders don't have to apply.
"We can't use the lame or the hunchbacked", Mr. Zheng said.
"Your image would be bad".
Liu Yi, patrolling Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple-like backs and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn't feel sexist about the emphasis on her looks.
"Do I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with a wry look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the image of the city".
According to them, they do not regret the short-term appointment, as they have more ambitious career plans than just shoving dealers down the aisles to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the police department deals with about a dozen street vendors who are trying to sell as many buns and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bicycle before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here".
"We've told you so many times!" explains Ms. Xu to a trader who had fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle kitchen mounted on a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the work is more monotonous than strenuous.
"It's the same almost every day", says Huang Jing, a 20-year-old student studying sales in her spare time.
"All the usual".
One reason is that the female officers cannot confiscate the merchandise of the dealers like their male colleagues.
You can only threaten offenders by telling them to report it to their male supervisor.
This is to protect them from public hostility, which is common among officials in China.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rioted after a rumour circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police and Chenguan officials were injured in the nightly incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared such violence so far.
But unrest is not to be excluded.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that had been repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a garage, in violation of the rules.
The owner was screaming Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers, grimacing, made their way to their vehicles and left the motorcycle and its owner.
Xu Liedong, 40, a male patrol coordinator, stayed behind, turning his white name tag over to remain anonymous.
Like their female colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supporting role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go on a verbal run".
"Sometimes physically", Mr. Li says soberly.
"Most of the time, people start with the fight".
The prosecutor will not prosecute Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of the charges brought against him after his affair with a former campaign worker and his attempt to lobby her husband, the senator's attorneys announced Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal challenge to Senator Ensign, a Republican from Nevada, who until the scandal made national headlines and put a damper on his career, was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
Senator Ensign's office said he was "very pleased" with the verdict after a year of investigation.
The Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigation against Senator Ensign had been discontinued and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The verdict came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who felt there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents first revealed in October 2009 in the New York Times led to speculation that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election aides, was using lucrative contracts to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife, Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as treasurer during an Ensign election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton work, and according to the documents and interviews, he took over Hampton's lobbying for them after the hiring.
As Hampton was recently on Ensign's campaign team, he was banned from lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called "ban on revolving-door lobbying".
According to the published evidence, "this appears to be a collusion and a violation of the revolving-door statutes", says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients targeted by the government.
While the Justice Department officially refused to reveal the reasons for its decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department seems very cautious in bringing political charges after a series of defeats that were followed by the media with great interest, including last year's decision to drop charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the state's attorney.
Lawyers "are obviously terrible", said Melanie Sloan, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an organization that has brought various lawsuits against Mr. Ensign.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, telling him that the department would not press charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, had "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he had presented to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of the conversations between the Department of Justice and myself, but let me just say that we believe we made the right decision", he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to suspend its investigation of a separate lawsuit by the Ethics Group alleging that a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The Election Commission said there wasn't enough evidence to prove that the money was anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that has long supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after the firm passed Mr. Hampton off as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was "going to the Home Office" for a matter.
Mr. Ensign also met with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after it stopped lobbying for Mr. Hampton.
When the first public information about this affair was revealed last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his Senate seat, where he had been ranked fourth in the Republican Party.
After months of inactivity, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a police investigation, his press secretary, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the Ethics Committee would follow the example of the Justice Department very quickly and shut down its investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in service of the people of Nevada", she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them were huddled in the courtroom.
In a matter of minutes, they were tweeting their accounts of gruesome witness statements.
In the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the trial of rape and children chained to beds in a house that was engulfed in flames.
On Thursday, the much-awaited trial of Steven J. Hayes, accused of killing three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, will officially come to an end as the jury's verdict on the death penalty is overturned.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed court papers arguing the grounds for an appeal that will occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense coverage of the trial - including the extensive use of Twitter by the average reporter - has created a "circus atmosphere" and such widespread, pervasive, and provocative detail that the jury was unduly influenced by public outrage.
This objection could lead the courts of appeal to consider whether the new technologies require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this trial, I believe there is a real danger that the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of every individual to a fair trial", said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' lead counsel.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court, briefly rejected the motions by decision last week, saying that the New Media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that was certainly not the final word on the matter.
For decades, litigation has found that reporting on famously infamous cases creates doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its landmark 1966 decision, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland osteopath, who allegedly killed his wife, and said in its decision that because of the New Media, there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom".
Some believe that the television series and the feature film "On the Run" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court challenges to Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the lines of communication from the courtroom, which were unthinkable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is good reason to be concerned about the influence of new media in trials that are followed by a broad public", said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has researched the death penalty in Connecticut, which he says is arbitrary.
Professor Donohue said some courts of appeal might be fascinated by the idea that restricting instant communication from the courtroom could make trials fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many that Mr. Hayes' lawyers have been putting together to debate for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defense also argues, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been convicted when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, filled them with disgust.
The defense also says they would challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge mistakenly replaced a juror who had been a critic of the prosecution, and that he unduly pressured the verdict by making the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But perhaps the most interesting is their argument about the impact of extensive reporting on the trial.
In a court appeal filed last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was being discussed by candidates during the governor's race and the U.S. Senate race.
They argued that the New Media had continually reignited the flames of emotion over the case.
"Such a daily procession of media men, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom", the lawyers wrote, "has never been seen before in New Haven and perhaps the nation".
Her focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct news stories were more provocative than reports that are replaced more slowly was a techno-oppositional view that impoverished reporting on future trials.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courts were often confronted with the argument that societal and technical changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers are backing that claim.
In their appeal, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction for reporting and made it clear that the New Media needed new rules.
"This case", they wrote, "represents Sheppard versus Maxwell for the 21st century".
Can courtesy bridge the gap?
After a campaign of name-calling and negativity, little civility has broken out in Washington this week.
Is this the sign of a real bipartisan cooperation or a moment of illusion before quickly returning to the battle of the parties in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders did not bring any breakthrough on the big issues that were being dealt with during the so-called lame duck session, the end of an administration's non-decision-making period.
From what we hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides, nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of partisan pocketing.
The President's public meeting of the Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that obscures the ideological divide that continues to separate members from one another.
This is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a testing phase - one demanding a sign of cooperation and compromise from the other, while the other is trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed party war.
The meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were therefore limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or advocacy, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, the November election was mild in Washington, at least for a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed", said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections are a source of partisan passions that die out.
And that's a good thing".
On some issues, especially those on the lame duck session agenda, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution".
Bush's tax cuts are ending at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of them, whether temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that they favored tax cuts for the rich while denying aid to unemployed workers.
After the meeting at the White House on Tuesday, optimism has grown that an agreement on these issues can be reached during the lame duck session and the New START treaty ratified at the same time.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session" does not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"Once the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation", he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - that politeness leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what's happening between now and 2012 as a prelude, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012", he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the makeup of the new Republican majority in the White House and the Tea Party voters who helped shape it.
As worried as Republican leaders may be about playing too high, they know they have to try to keep their promises to cut government spending and undo health care reform.
These partisan lines are already apparent in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes, the raising of the retirement age and the reduction of government expenditure.
Vice-Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, in their own estimation, pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 votes out of 18 within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are fighting hard to get anywhere near that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the Council, since there is little leeway or sympathy for compromise on financial issues, at least today.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will be next year in the form of partisan clashes, with Republicans challenging Obama on the state budget, taxes and health care, followed later by a phase of larger bipartisan cooperation.
What will bring about this change?
The public opinion.
It's been proven that despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
When confrontation leads to a dead end, as it did in 1995, both parties must carefully watch for public reaction.
Whoever is doomed to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there appears to be a larger ideological divide between Obama and the congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists in both parties see 2010 as a prelude to a far more consequential election in 2012.
In this regard, the courtesy displayed this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that continue to divide them.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city is controlled by the "Kleptocracy" and they pass some of the bribes and protection money they collect to the Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia reported in a memo in February.
Both the police and the State Security Service extort large protection money so that they can maintain their expensive living standards in Moscow, it is said.
They're raising money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized crime gangs.
Each layer of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "verticals of authority" - takes its share of the money that travels up the ladder.
The memo, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that he has been cleaned up since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won numerous libel suits against such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's filthy".
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe their society is corrupt, polls have shown.
But it is unusual for individuals to be named, as in the ambassador's report, and it is unheard of for this to be done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the government of Moscow with crime has led some to describe it as 'dysfunctional' and conclude that the government is more like a kleptocrat than a government", the memo says.
"Criminal elements enjoy a kryschna (a term from the criminal/mafia world, literally meaning 'roof' or 'shelter') that extends through the police, the State Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and the Prosecutor's Office as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-tier structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top".
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level".
"Last to the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors at the lowest level".
"This is an incompetent system where criminal groups are filling a gap in some areas because the city is not offering any help".
The report goes on to say that the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
One source, it is said, "said that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law".
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is not as much in demand as it once was".
The memo notes that while the fundraising is extensive, the protection itself is very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed - on one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but has also noted that he has made little progress.
The embassy memo contains descriptions of men going into the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats", Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow-based expert commission, said in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy".
"It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia".
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent study of global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the US Embassy memo, which happened late night Moscow time, is sure to cause some controversy within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's mistakes, it may also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that it is solving the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic politics in this country", he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect it to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know".
Khmer Rouge forced veterans to confront the past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and flaking walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School remembers the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves the Ta Mok".
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people", said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he has built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, longtime supporters in Anlong Veng are being challenged.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims to publicly confront the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that for the first time tells children of former soldiers the story of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a joint UN-Cambodian tribunal convicted a former Khmer Rouge member for the first time when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Khmer Rouge veteran Alnlong Vengs, making it difficult for them to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything", said Chhang Youk, head of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"For her, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil".
"It even splits families".
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died from disease, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-led government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary waged guerrilla warfare from their base in the western mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok drew the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-brokered peace agreement in 1993 led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to flock to the government, leading to the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given in, was arrested by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, where he was awaiting trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia, and many retained the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local government posts because they laid down their arms, the common soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender", said Sok Leang of the Justice and Reconciliation Center, which holds public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are rooted in the regime's utopian agrarian ideology".
"They grew up without any professional knowledge".
Lim, 55, who joined the RHM in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle around Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to live a life of poverty as a rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good", he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat".
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves".
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to bring to trial Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The mandate of the tribunal is to prosecute the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has done little to allay the fears of Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told officials at the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that is believed to have killed thousands of forced laborers.
One hot evening, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to her log house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the long sun shadows the withered grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her Khmer Rouge past.
She said that if the court summoned her, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is living in peace and stability", she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would charge more suspects, although experts and historians debate this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past", he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation with Khmer times means putting the pieces together", he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can all understand".
The Centre created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the Ministry of Education's history book for high school, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As is often the case in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court", he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will be convicted by the court".
Such resistance makes the process of reconciliation complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the textbook and the courts are gradually gaining influence", he said.
The Khmer Rouge still holds a powerful appeal here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, a path covered in bushes and plastic debris leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a pile of hay here after he died in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone saleswoman on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray", she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day she was going to Pol Pot's final resting place, where she would lay a bush of ripe bananas - hoping that it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to stop stockpiling weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure global nuclear materials, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer stockpile highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarus Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The US government had tried for years to persuade Belarus to stop accumulating highly enriched uranium, and it seemed to have hit a wall last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements were made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official who remains anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the key outcomes of Obama's April "47 Nations Nuclear Security Summit", which excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (from 2012)".
"This proves to me that it works", said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
In April 2009 in Prague, Obama promised to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the George W. Bush administration.
At Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms, which is fundamentally weapons-grade, and less enriched uranium", Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we will not make dirty bombs out of it and we will not sell it to anyone".
"We're using it for research purposes, that's all".
The European Union is not a party to the Treaty of Rome, but it is a party to the Treaty of Rome.
The first attempt to remove the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by air, according to officials.
The US government is paying $14 million for this effort, with much of the money going to Belarusian research into low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium that year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
The joint agreement calls for Belarus to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's gross disregard for human rights.
But the statement from Wednesday suggests a possible rapprochement.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus acknowledge that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens", she states.
Spanish government has no objection to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flying Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents leaked by Wikileaks and transmitted to the newspaper El País (via cable), which adds that former Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored".
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe denouncing the aid to human rights abuses in a dozen countries, including Spain, former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre met with Fernández de la Vega.
The Deputy Prime Minister admitted that the Council's report had "hit Zapatero in the face" and reiterated that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objection to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory".
"They just want to be informed", so as not to be "taken by surprise", Aguirre reports by cable.
The former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also told the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, since it is in the hands of the judges".
In January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González informed the embassy that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Central Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information", the ambassador said after a meeting with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than the declassified information from the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to achieve discrete government-to-government management", Aguirre laments.
At a luncheon in March 2007 attended by the US ambassador and the Spanish interior minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are crazy about their independence and do what they think is appropriate", he instructed his staff to "avoid inflated rhetorical comments to defuse the tension".
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the government has tolerated or deliberately ignored Zapatero's actions in the US that could be construed as potential human rights violations, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government", he emphasizes.
The child murderer confessed to complaining on the Internet about the "hardship" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when it was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in the Galician way"
Juanatey Mónica Fernández is known as "Muki" on the Internet.
Under this nickname, which she has carried since childhood, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend, both from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The messages are from 2008.
To understand this, you need to know her love life, which the daily newspaper ABC reconstructed based on the testimony of her family members.
In 1998, the 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
It lasted a year.
Shortly after she broke up with him, it was revealed that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex-wife never let him run a DNA test.
Soon after, she entered into another relationship.
The one chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their love affair broke down and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work".
"When I told him that, he was fine with it, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be free to do and let do as he pleases".
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her cell phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address where I can send the boy to".
She laments: "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back".
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "I'm going there this week, but I'll only be there until the 19th because I have to report to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it".
She explains that she will take her firstborn with her if all goes well.
"He'll be with whoever he has to be with, which is me. I'll never leave him with anyone else in my life except my mother", a dubious intent, considering their bad relationship.
There's another email coming in July.
As she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the first of the month and was supposedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other, not".

Popular Party won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
The results of 28 November could make the PP a decisive force in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and representatives in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking forward to the parliamentary elections - early or not - and its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party obtains in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
The Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, compared to only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On Sunday the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of the PSC's shifting vote share and the PP's voter-binding - continues, PP analysts predict that in the general elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while CiU would also gain four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 (out of 25) congressmen.
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for the PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the PP, the ERC would lose one member - it currently has three - while ICV could keep its member or gain one.
If the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date for local elections will be in May 2011, but even then the Popular Party (PP) can be the one to end the socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the Popular Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists will not win a majority and will not be able to rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debate, it is not unlikely that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council, where it would need to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, increased its share of the vote in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The Nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in the Tarragona revolution, where they governed together with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC, and the mayor, Ángel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - they met several times during the last election campaign.
In other important towns, such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus, the People's Party also made significant gains.
The PP is currently represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and is seeking to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports .
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona , there were three others in Thailand .
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerian arrested by the Barcelona police intelligence officers formed the Thai-controlled jihadist cell which provided passports to various Al Qaida groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the perpetrator of the 2008 Bombay bombings that killed 106 people.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, going so far as to assert that the 'Operation Kampai' has 'weakened' the Al Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus worldwide and 'thus its capacity to act'.
The researchers estimate that during the two years that the cell operated in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were forged and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries with impunity.
The cell that has been uncovered is not the only jihadist network active in Europe, which is why other European police units have also been involved in the investigation, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies.
In coordination with this operation (which arrested Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another was carried out in Thailand, arresting Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They had been running the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was destroyed in 2009 - stole passports from tourists in particular, according to the guidelines of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents had to be issued in the name of men between the ages of 25 and 45 and be valid for several years; they could not have a visa stamp.
The investigation circles stress that so far no links have been established between those arrested in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay, although the perpetrator of this attack was "Lashkar e-Taiba", one of the groups that received the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack, several thousand dollars had been sent from Catalonia by means of a money transfer company, which was "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "commando" that took the lives of 106 people.
The police have confiscated a large amount of documentation.
PP is asking Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present to Artur Mas her conditions in support of his accession as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are no different from those already set during the election campaign and can be summed up with the priority of economic recovery and the refusal of regionalist independence ventures, such as a financial compensation agreement that the regionalist leader intends to propose at the height of his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party, Artur Mas, was reassured by the 18 MPs she won on Sunday, a number more than sufficient to make her feel indispensable, as the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist CiU party is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining in the vote on his inauguration.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to make in the upcoming parliamentary elections in the Congress depend on a possible agreement with the PP.
As for the PPC party leader, she demands that "all the discourse on the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" be suspended in support of the entry into office, as well as an agreement on financial compensation between the state and the autonomous region - similar to the Basque Country - which the CiU party leader even wants to subject to a referendum.
Both political leaders have in common that they want to streamline the political apparatus of the regional administration and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations for Mas's accession to the Presidency are being worked out by Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat of the PPC.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the term 'competition' in the context of the directive on the protection of the environment.
Nursing home confirms deaths not due to 'failure to act'
The owners of the Olot nursing home do not rule out that their caregiver killed over eleven elderly people
The authorities of the Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) held a press conference yesterday, revealing the damage caused to the institution by the criminal actions of Joan Vila Dilmés, the carer who, in the course of his work, had killed at least eleven elderly people in his care.
The director of the nursing home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, appeared in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to prosecute the person responsible (for the deaths) " but that "the law and our obligation to take responsibility compel us to accept the process and the civil liability".
The institution not only has to suffer a loss of social standing for not having detected the criminal acts of the carer in time, but now also has to pay a large sum of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime was committed in August 2009 and that he has continued to kill since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had examined the deceased personally, but the formalities were handled by telephone due to their age and illness.
The head of La Caritat flatly denied this point, stating that "lack of action could not have been the cause of the incidents".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no indication of negligence on the part of any other person than the defendant".
The man who was already known as the "Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders yesterday, saying he committed the first on August 29, 2009, and the second one a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed with an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime, where he had administered a mixture of various tranquilizers.
The head of La Caritat said it was difficult to control the access of the staff to the medicines.
The nurse used the insulin injections and the sedative cocktail on six of the nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the lab tests will reveal whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned them from the inside by administering bleach to them, as he confessed to doing with the three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
La Caritat does not believe the nurse's testimony, not even regarding the number of confessed murders, which could be more, this attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they have made them available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threats from the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that 'the markets should not underestimate our ability to react'.
The risk premiums of the euro periphery countries have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be wrong and that the euro has barely gained points, which is a cause for concern.
Yesterday's events are typical of an illiquid market which recovers as it collapses, but as a result of the closing of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor is not going to lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank asked us to reverse our liquidity measures, which means that tomorrow the ECB will have to back out for the fourth time in two years, and probably many more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the plan to buy government bonds to be terminated as it was ineffective and for all temporary exceptional liquidity measures to be abolished, with only one week's unlimited access to be maintained.
The Commission notes that the Irish authorities have not provided any evidence that the measures are necessary to restore the viability of the Bank.
We also expect the bond-purchase programme to continue and to send a positive signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets of yesterday will be thrown back again, and if it is insisted that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As with the ECB meeting in May, when the bank confirmed that it was not considering buying government bonds and the markets collapsed, this could be a repeat of the story tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year government bonds in Portugal was quite weak.
The State Treasury spent only 500 million at 5.28%, compared to 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points across the curve, reflecting a change in market perceptions, according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the debt gap figures were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000 million, with time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognise the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are acceptable under the rescue plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
The Commission's proposal to the Council on the establishment of a European Agency for the Evaluation of Chemical Waste is a step in the right direction, but it is not yet clear whether the Commission will be able to take action on the matter.
The European Parliament has also called for the establishment of a European Parliament with a European Parliament and a European Council, and for the Commission to be able to take part in the work of the European Parliament.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
The Spanish Prime Minister presented yesterday the action plan which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions and in financial institutions, reduction of the public deficit, liberalization, privatization and job creation measures, measures that sound like Vivaldi's Four Seasons to investors.
The Zapatero and Trichet double effect explains why the Spanish stock market has gained 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
The reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was swift and convincing compared with February, and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a major auction of a three-year Treasury bond that will take advantage of the Trichet effect, so we are betting on strong demand that will remove all doubt about our ability to reschedule.
For Spain, requesting a rescue plan would be a sacrifice of self.
We would get liquidity we don't need, the Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March, interest rates are very high and access to the markets would be closed indefinitely.
But our strategy should be in line with the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now it's not just the being that counts, but the appearance".
We can do this.
The chairman of the board of Eulen attends the Vega Sicilia shareholders' meeting at the request of his children
The storm of the open conflict of the Alvarez family, owners of the companies Oulen and El Enebro, is not abating.
David Álvarez, founder of the company Gurppe, will contest the general meeting of El Enebro, which will be held on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers it "absolutely void".
David Alvarez and his children, Jesús David and María José, are preparing legal action for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company does not seem to be prepared to give up his legal battle for control of El Enebro's organs.
He was ousted from the board of directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed to the board of directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year, which was already registered in the commercial register as being contested.
The general meeting of El Enebro, called by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderbolt in the lap of the Alvarez family.
The Court of First Instance is the only judicial body which can guarantee the convening of the general meeting.
The latest strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means by the petitioner - his five children - to obtain recognition of the annulled assembly of 18 January by means of legal tricks, fraudulent machinations and abuse of law", as official spokesmen explain.
This argument is the basis for the subsequent challenge to the congregation, declaring it to be "totally worthless".
The same actors, who are discreetly silent, tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting by judicial means.
At El Enebro - the property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
The founder of the service group, on the other hand, claims the right to use more than 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
That is the background to the matter which the judge is to decide at the hearing on the appeal, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are being upgraded with software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this exquisite universe has been marked by the speed of surprises and successes.
At first, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steep climb during the last seasons, at the final sprint last November, everyone relied on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without wishing to belittle the skills of the German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the 'secret weapon' that put the Multi Siemens Red Bull in the hands of the winning team has become legendary.
In fact, it is a powerful process simulation software launched by the German company in 2007 for non-racing purposes.
This computer program, called PLM, has been used to develop assembly lines in factories around the world, power plants, and high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce or simulate a product or process before it is actually built, in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's airplanes and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that by using this software in Formula 1, the Red Bull factory can design and implement the changes and improvements that are detected in the races and in the tests "in a few hours, almost in real time".
Russwurm states that in 1992 the average number of technicians working in the racing stables was ten, who could introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in a season.
Today, the Red Bull team employs 180 highly skilled young people, using powerful computer systems to perform analysis and make all sorts of changes to the racing cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software was able to analyse and improve all the components of Red Bull's racing cars, except for the engine, for which Renault claims to be solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are all changed.
The changes can be transferred from the simulator's virtual reality to the real world in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced production equipment and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this insane technical perfectionism is the $40 million a Formula 1 team can spend on its racing in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and production of its racing cars in a place 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits - particularly by journalists - are severely restricted.
Everything that happens in there is top secret.
The crew consists of 580 people, including the two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is without a doubt the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts at the service of his participation in the racing circuit, there are other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose popularity is almost nil.
The plant's chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, points out that five years ago, it was fair to say that advances in R&D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory, and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, the ratios have changed, with technology accounting for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computer technology, because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a network of 20 shops, each of 80 to 100 square metres, which Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company is coordinating this initiative with the 16 existing multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice-Chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, gave the example of the converted store on Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American group intends to establish 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), and Barcelona is the third store.
Herrera didn't want to reveal the upcoming new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next target.
The Vice-Chair, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, said that the philosophy of opening a store was always the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies will advise them and will provide the exclusive store equipment (with interactive products to touch).
HP is also responsible for the training of shop staff.
Helena Herrero said that this was not a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive sales network was intended to "optimize customer service and advice to small and micro enterprises during and after the purchase, even the packaging".
The Barcelona shop has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP equipment with a warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days".
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro-enterprises and private customers, because the large enterprises already have their service contracts for technical customer service", explained Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'steal' one million customers in three years
The CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers, believing that 2001 will be a tough year for banks, but he initially denies a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he foresees a collapse in interest rates, which banks will try to offset by raising fees and charges for loans.
Sabadell expects to have one million private customers in three years - a still-to-be-developed sector.
Sabadell has found a way to make the most of the next three years and survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year roadmap in 2011.
The objective is not only to survive without the public assistance from the FROB, but also to increase its market share by 1 million private customers - 700 000 if you subtract the customers the bank will lose - and this is the great challenge facing the bank, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year, it has added 250 000 private customers and 50 000 businesses.
Its market share among private customers is 3.5% while the market share of business customers is over 10%.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction, and the challenges the Bank will face in this respect will be presented together with the annual report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the global financial crisis has thrown banks' plans into disarray.
Sabadell will complete this year its Optima roadmap, which was set out four years ago and was originally designed for three years, but was extended for one financial year as a result of the market situation.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main target of the bank.
At a breakfast organised by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a great range".
The manager assumes that Spain will emerge from the crisis only 'slowly'.
Moreover, it would be "very difficult" to "create jobs" in two or three years' time - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if he expects the war on liabilities, which is punishing interest rates, to end, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks have to pay for their issues to maintain liquidity will already be passed on to the price of credit to compensate for shrinking profit margins.
"The liquidity and financing issues are structural and will put pressure on lending".
"We haven't turned the tap off, but the interest rate differentials are very high", admitted Guardiola.
Banesto already gave instructions to its network of branches on Thursday to restrict the issuing of long-term loans and to increase the interest rate differential (see Cinco Días, 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the strategy of 'increasing fees', but 'within a competitive framework'.
Sabadell's strategy is based on organic growth, although the group does not, as always, exclude corporate business.
It is not without reason that he assures that in Spain 'larger companies are necessary'.
"Everything will change next year", he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "increasing enormously" and does not rule out the possibility that some Spanish financial institutions will fail in the red.
He believes that the FROB could replace the money market in the event of capital increases.
After assuring that Sabadell could survive a temporary market closure, he dismissed the argument of some bankers who were already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of farmers in the EU by a further two to three, and to increase the number of farmers in the EU by a further two to three.
CECA rules out a second wave of mergers of savings banks
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out the possibility of a wave of mergers between savings banks, stressing the speed with which the sector is being restructured.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks insisted on not participating in the first phase, reserving the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Savings Bank Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, said that the second round would not take place.
'I believe that the majority of the mergers have been completed, and the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, but rather as an adjustment.'
"The majority of the work is done, and we may have 13 or 14 instead of 17, but all the important work has been completed, and it has been controlled by the Banco de España, which has been very supportive of all the work".
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Aragonese Directors and Managers (ADEA), Olavarrieta said that the merger process had been "carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timeliness that was established in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million in assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 per cent and they are now much larger, which means that we have fulfilled the Basel Convention", he stressed.
Olavarrieta said that "there are a number of unbroken opinions about the slowness of the process, which reveal lack of seriousness and nonsense" because "Banco de España exhorts us to finish on time before the end of the year".
The CECA's director general, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the world, adding that those who questioned it did so "without any deep knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic climate, we have "no need to worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very significant" process of concentration, which will be completed "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July with very good results.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has decided to keep the euro, but at the same time it has set conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a two-pronged response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has proposed new adjustment measures, ranging from tax breaks for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary work enterprises or the abolition of the 426 euro support for unemployed persons who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Prime Minister, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis.
How can these events be understood?
It was anticipated that Merkel's position was not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In this way, Germany is adopting a fundamentally new perspective for shaping our future, which is in conflict with the maintenance of the long-standing traditions of many of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
First, a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the euro area.
The second is that the reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although it sounds like science fiction at the moment - is supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 per cent of the population.
Thirdly, a restructuring of the euro, in line with German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishing countries that go beyond the limits; possibly suspending payments in some countries and passing on the cost of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled a constitutional reform from its sleeve to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of a drift between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second signal was given by the central European country, when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to bail out Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a bailout of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Mrs Merkel again came out with a clear position: she is calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time to oblige private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it was the one that fuelled the Irish crisis and everything that followed.
But their proposal, although somewhat sugary, was accepted, and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which is to make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line which it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that - even if unpopular measures have to be taken now - the old way of the euro will no longer exist after that date.
2013 will be the year of the birth of a new currency area, where countries that are in breach of the rules are severely punished, can be forced to declare insolvency and in this case the private sector has to bear some of the costs.
Germany is showing us that we must pursue a hard growth path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement in productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as was proposed by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would be doing a disservice not to understand it.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope the current turbulence will subside.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that are offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of bringing order to one's own house has made its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look like it will change.
Among the possibilities considered is that we would have to leave the euro area, which is full of countries with little credibility.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and recreational activities
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged suspension of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on 23 November led to much speculation about whether or not it was an unsportsmanlike act and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls for the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would be leading their group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction in the next league match against Auxerre and thus enter the next phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, but rather a common occurrence in the world of football.
It's so widespread that it's part of the ethos - the unwritten rules that are followed in this sport.
Part of the debate surrounding the case is that it was a team from Real Madrid (which in its anthem proclaims "Noble Courage and Honor" and has punished its players for similar incidents on other occasions) that played the main role, and the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is whether this conduct, which is expressly prohibited by the statutes, is not contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a breach of the rules.
In this case, the damage to sportsmanship should be investigated.
The spirit of the game defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of fair play is to avoid the opposing players taking unfair advantage of the opposing team.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand as foul play or rule-breaking, because the rule-breaking was not done secretly to avoid a penalty, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the infringers derived from the intentional fouls.
It should be emphasized here that neither the opponent was put at a disadvantage nor any advantage was taken for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club doesn't have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players can start the next round of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardise their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term, to some extent uncertain advantage, as the team may eventually drop out, and the players who do so are penalized and move on to the second card cycle, where they drop out with one less card than in the first cycle due to card overload.
This makes it less clear whether it is really an advantage.
In the end, such approaches are not against the spirit of the game, which includes strategic decisions to get the most out of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to avoid a penalty (this would indeed be a clear case of rule-breaking), they wanted to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic choice without evading or fleeing punishment.
Although the line between inventiveness and regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the controversy arose from two factors: because there were two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the transfer of the rule.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offering to attract customers for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar is causing an avalanche of reservations to fall on the 16th and 17th of December this year.
The number of parties paid for by employees is increasing, and they don't want to spend more than 20 or 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas Lottery, group dinners are once again organised in the run-up to Christmas, providing oxygen to the restaurant and leisure industry in Barcelona, but as a result of the economic crisis they are triggering a price offensive to capture the customer segment that represents the mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the entrepreneurs and associations surveyed confirm.
To complicate the bookkeeping a bit, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) dropped all orders to the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations on two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped the group dinners for financial reasons.
In order not to be forced to renounce this tradition, many workers pay for it out of their own pockets.
Whatever the economic situation, low prices are being demanded, confirms the chairman of the Barcelona Restaurant Association, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella association has not yet dared to predict what the holidays will be like this month.
"People think twice before they book".
"They want to go out, but they pay close attention to prices", he says.
Business will be good with those who "offer quality at good prices with good service", he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices around 25 euros are the most sought after.
A survey of several central restaurants reveals that the evening of December 17th is the one that leads to the collapse of the vendors.
The Soteras Group says that demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom.The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
In the case of another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain last year's prices with menus for every taste from €19.95 to €30", he explains.
AN Grup, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 stores, is not losing its optimism after the second quarter saw a return to profitability and good prospects for Christmas sales, albeit concentrated on a few days.
Sources within the group point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
The six group menus have been joined by a Christmas menu for €30 or more as a pre-hit, giving the impression that customers are willing to spend 10% more than last year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Some companies are also seeing green shoots, which is why employees are being invited back, giving the impression that group dinners are on the rise again.
The vice-chairman, Enric Gomà, from the umbrella organisation Fecasarm (with associations such as the Barcelona Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association), believes that the tunnel is coming to an end and notes that the reservations are quite "vibrant" overall, although customers are "beating the top".
But the fun of the party didn't go away, no matter who paid.
Pakistan's nuclear program is causing great concern in the US
Islamabad is making nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Wikileaks revelations confirm the ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks, confirms the enormous concern Washington has about Pakistan's nuclear program.
Aside from the clarifying and juicy details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not being strengthened, but on the contrary is "decreasing", and that the unstable Asian country is producing more nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country".
The specific nature of Pakistan's nuclear programme - that the weapons are not assembled but their parts are stored to make their destruction more difficult in the event of an attack - is keeping Washington awake at night.
The following risks are listed by Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in a report before the visit of former National Security Council head James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the likely spread of nuclear material and the vulnerability of nuclear material transport".
The large number of people implicated in the nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is now seen as excessive and a reason for caution not only by the United States but also by Russia.
"Pakistan must hire strictly religious personnel to guard nuclear facilities; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work on nuclear or missile programs", Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New on the documentary unveiled by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation is waning and the increased pace at which Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office, describing communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", explained: "There is often no transparency; offers of help are not answered or are rejected".
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a State Intelligence Officer for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons faster than any other country".
Ambassador Patterson is asking Washington during a visit by the army's commander in chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify" to the responsible that "Pakistan's army must stop its tacit support for terrorist groups".
In the hunt for the head of WikiLeaks
Obama appoints a top counterterrorism official to prevent further revelations.
Interpol is issuing a red alert for the pursuit and apprehension of Assange.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complex maze, a maze of facts that are difficult to unravel.
Interpol issued a "red alert" yesterday for the "search and prosecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arresting order.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
It has nothing to do with the recent leak of over four million US diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse facing the Australian in Sweden.
The lawyer for the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, also assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange".
The international police authority in Lyon, France, issued the order on 20 July at Sweden's request, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities had given the authorization.
The 188 countries of Interpol are instructed to identify and locate Assange "in order to arrest and extradite him provisionally".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, according to the organization, many member countries consider the red alert as a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be staying.
The move outraged Assange's lawyers, who released a letter saying the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder was willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities via videoconference.
You also recall that Assange applied for and received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor, who is likened to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal pursuit", the letter accuses.
While the world is searching for him - and his mother from Australia is insisting on her son's innocence - Assange is in an unknown location, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype from an unspecified location, during which he requested the resignation of the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thereby violated international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign", he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website", he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, with preventing new document releases.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to de-emphasize Assange is contrary to the opinions being voiced by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House National Security Committee starting in January, has urged the State Department to explore the possibility of listing WikiLeaks as a terrorist organization "to seize its funds and prosecute anyone who supports or contributes to it".
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, went further and had to retract his statement that Assange must be "murdered".
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something".
The only one who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever leaked information to the government is guilty of treason and anything short of execution is a lesser punishment", he told Fox News.
Puigcercós winked at the approaching peace in the ERC
The Republican leader is allowing the party to hold a secret vote on his continued tenure.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the plenary principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid an internal turmoil in the ranks of the ERC, which has lost 11 MEPs and half of the votes, for the tenth time.
The leader is aware that his threat to resign does not satisfy the close associates of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weakened today as its mentor himself and will not give him the same headache as other former currents.
So the leader of Esquerra is trying to win over the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For starters, yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional ERC members could speak in secret about his remaining in office.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the carodians wanted to give the president a ticket, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the impression of both division and subordination to him.
In several interviews, he confirmed that he would not feel validated with half the votes plus one, and he added, without giving percentages, that a "Bulgarian-style" result would not be good either.
Those close to Carod demand that the president do more than just give his office to the party, a gesture that is insufficient given Puigcercós' control of the highest organ of the congresses.
But since they don't have a majority to force resignations, they're going to agree with the board on a course of action between now and May.
They expect to be involved in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation which the management will put to the Council for a vote on the 18th.
They intend to vouch for Puigcercós, who in return is to promise to move the congress to the autumn of 2011, which the party leadership already considers a fact.
The ERC chairman believes that 'polyphony' is a stability-damaging practice and is seeking to ensure that the organisation can once and for all do its dirty work behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the current Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologue, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party leader is supported "in exchange for different goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the executive committee so that it represents at least 90% of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's entourage.
The second one could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally abandon the principle of plenary assembly as a way of functioning.
The European Parliament has adopted a resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
Puigcercós' team, which has already fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with ending the model of the plenary assembly - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the tremendous meeting of 2008, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of the plenary assembly at a congress that was to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending, as in view of the internal turmoil of recent years it was not advisable to deal with this matter.
Now that the critical sectors are no longer on the lookout, it may be time to take up this matter again and close it for good.
23 killed in November, 290 in the year 2010
According to the MILENIO count, there were four fewer cases in Mexico than in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to the MILENIO México count.
Among the murdered are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, we have a total of 390 deaths, probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases, one stands out in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, a town in Toluca.
Subject had at least three gunshot wounds, the gunshot wound to the head, and his hands and feet were tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a person was found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on Mixtecas Street in the Santa Cruz Acatlán neighborhood of the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday, the 4th, early in the morning, agricultural workers found a body with torture marks and at least three fatal shots in the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway, in the section that crosses the village of Villa Guerrero.
A note was found near the body, believed to be signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was shot eight times and killed after leaving his home to do his job as a garbage man.
On November 7, two 30-year-old people died from head injuries in the settlement of San Pedro Xaloxtoc in the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalcro, the body of a man was found with a bullet in his forehead on a lonely road in the settlement of El Naranjo and under the body a shell casing shot with a firearm of the caliber.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewer of the Playa Golondrina settlement.
Emergency services searched for the remaining body parts, but they didn't find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán reported the discovery of a body they had discovered in the area of Peña Colorada, with the hands tied behind the back and the head bound.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of the neck.
In the middle of the month, it was reported that two men were murdered, their bodies wrapped in blankets and found in the trunk of a car parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza, along with two death threats.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement of Valle de los Reyes in the town of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the remains of the body were found in a black plastic bag with a note signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two women were found dead in the settlement of Zoquiapan, in the municipality of Ixtapaluca, wrapped in blankets, and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, the body of a man was found wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, who, according to the message left by his killers, was probably named Mario Ríos.
In the San Francisco Acuautla settlement of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found with gunshot wounds to the neck.
Tattoos of Santa Muerte were found on the woman's skin, as well as chains with corresponding images.
In the last half of the month, in the municipality of Zinacantepec, the body of a man was found next to a vehicle with at least three gunshot wounds and a note signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men, whose heads were covered with duct tape, and a message were discovered in the Puente de Piedra municipality in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Across the body was a note, presumably signed by a criminal organization, that read: "This is what happens to those who don't join".
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found, hand and foot bound, with signs of torture, in a taxi parked behind the San Agustín Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first had been beheaded in the settlement of Cuchilla Ancón and bound in black plastic bags, with a note next to it; the second had been tortured and was found in a plastic bag in the streets of the settlement of Juárez.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a note.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
China's representative at COP16 said that China has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and that it would maintain its commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China is sticking to its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public speech at the 16th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to transform its industry.
He explained that in the last four years his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work with the international community on this matter.
He explained that China's climate change strategy has four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress was made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which included targets for reducing gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the authorities of the provincial states have worked together with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient use of energy and emission reduction.
The Commissioner also said that the Commission had already started or completed several multiannual plans, both those funded by the Chinese government and those funded by other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Program, which has been in place for the past five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), government and private sources.
There is also a project at provincial level on climate change, another on replacing traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs and another on mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, the scientific adviser to the government on climate change in the country, confirmed that China's efforts were far greater than would be generally assumed.
He pointed out that China's per capita emissions of greenhouse gases were six tons per person, while in the United States it was 100 tons, and China is responsible for nine percent of the total contribution to environmental pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in energy use, with energy efficiency having increased by 20% in the last five years and another one due by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion of Espinos: Cesar Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former Panist party chairman had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and demand what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was justified and that the former party leader of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and demand what the law would grant him.
In an interview that took place before the appeal of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as the governor of the state, he explained that the expulsion of Espinos was a decision made at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Law and Order Commission of Sonora".
'Mr Espino has the right to appeal his case to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional, so that a decision is taken by a competent body,' he added.
On the other hand, he said, it's time to think about 2012 and that an alliance of presidential candidates has never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge stronger from the internal vote on December 4 and 5, which will elect his successor.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary, we enjoy it and it strengthens us", he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairperson or chairperson needed by Acción Nacional for the next three years, and that he would therefore hand the reins to "the one the Council would appoint".
"I am very open and frank, and I would be proud to give the post of party chairman to any of the five".
He predicted that the party's surge in the last 4 July elections would be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not the time to think about 2012".
"Now it's about helping Governor Gabino Cué in his task".
In this context, he highlighted that the three governments that emerged from the alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, which carry the flag and are observed throughout the country, are "placed with many hopes and aspirations and I am sure that Gabino is up to the task".
Asked about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his discourses during his four-year term, Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet", he affirmed.
He believes that the head of the federal government should use the same words he used in his speech in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there is no censorship and even less censorship.
Obama tweets in support of undocumented students law
"If you are for the passage of the Dream Act, then call your senators and push for the passage of this bill", the president of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act, a law that legalizes undocumented students, with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you are in favor of passing the DREAM Act, then call your senators and push for the passage of this bill", Obama tweeted.
His brief message includes a cyberlink to a larger document that urges the public to contact their senators specifically as the bill is about to be voted on.
"With your voice, which we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you", he stresses.
The news was spread after 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any bill except for the expansion of the Bush-era tax cuts and the expansion of government funding.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of the new START nonproliferation treaty with Russia.
Asked about the Republican block on the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he hoped that once the tax issue was resolved, a timeline could be drawn up for the remaining projects.
"I think we have a lot of time...
"We all agree that the tax affair must be settled before the end of the year"...
"I believe we can reach an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the expiry of the balance", he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would "ask for the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act, which would allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students, could be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, though next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the American Dream Act, would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States before they were sixteen, have lived in the country for the past five years, and are enrolled in a higher education institution or in the military.
But the proponents of the bill need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they are dependent on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At the moment, the organizations that are advocating this project are organizing an intensive influence on the passage of the bill.
The Democrats, who are the majority in support of the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the bill.
That's why the defenders of the Dream Act need to get more Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most sought-after Republicans are Maine's Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Florida's Senator George Lemieux, who took over from Sen. Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have stated that they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who spoke in favor of the bill, John McCain, has not yet made his case.
Although the House has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Putting the finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust of Speech' was a walk where participants worked on their narrative skills
"I understand the sex in language thing, but... The finger in the wound? What do you expect from me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a series celebrating Spanish-language literature, using the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event, she explained, the round table was dedicated to sex in language).
The finger in the wound... "it's getting us into trouble", the Argentine writer spat sweetly to the audience, which was mainly young people, who had gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to attend the round table table, moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Shultz later described as a great narrative. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist, who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she receives no answer, but clues for the guide of her story.
She leaves the infectious disease specialist with the conviction: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it's my wound".
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the trauma therapist, who took her breath away in the middle of the hallway, and who explained that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst revealed the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist of the story sighs with relief and concludes that she "learned from the wound only that it is really open and does not exist". But she is convinced that the pleasure of language and its traps are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful account, which he called "praise of invention", and in which the finger in the wound, although not mentioned, is discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back men who traveled far or who restored a lost virtue from a girl. The narrative made a turn and reported on America, the great novel that from the beginning did not lack its own chroniclers, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), mocked the sham witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as true, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told - with imagination that even the sense of shame was lost".
However, he points out that "it is the madmen and liars who imagine things best", and there reality and lie converge, where one no longer knows which side the story belongs to, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
He actually calls it the "Tradition of Cervantes".
"From him we inherited to be what is told".
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the diversity of interpretations that the FIl's invitation to the round table had contributed to.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican delegates dedicated their contribution to the great wound of social violence inflicted on their country - as on the whole of Latin America - as a result of the struggles over the drug trade.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, unplanned commitment", she explained, after emphasizing that literature is communication and a bond that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
The evening was concluded by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the committed writer in the writer's wound".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, even intellectual habits and mind control can be dogmatic, forgetting "that behind every affirmation is a little no and behind every denial is a little yes".
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and to nuance often means to put the finger in the wound and to bother those who feel much more comfortable thinking in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in preconceived ideas without nuances, and also to bother those in power who prefer to divide the world into black and white", he noted, and invited a rediscovery of the meaning of writing.
Romano is fighting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in the playoffs, he's had his ups and downs in his career, but three times he's played in the deciding games.
The final match between Santos Laguna and Monterrey also pits two different styles, each dictated by their respective coaches, against each other, and their contrasting encounters are reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has been holding up well, which is why this opportunity is of very special importance to him.
The Argentine has become the second champion with the medal, he has been one step behind the winners and, surprisingly, he has been with the same team in consecutive finals.
The santista strategist reached the first final as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in hand, with which he suffered a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003', he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take another setback, as the game ended in a 2-2 draw against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty he came forward with 3-1 and got two chances to take his title, but in the end three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned into a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he does not want to be followed by misfortune once again and free himself from the evil spell to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break statistics, this is for a club, for my affection, to which I give myself, and therefore the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important", the driver commented when asked about the lost finals.
The last final game has remained firmly in his memory, he assures, having learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee whistles the end, we can not celebrate, we are prepared at the line, the players too, because the last time we were already prepared to retire with two penalty minutes, and I believe that this is a lesson, until the game is over, there is no reason to celebrate".
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shootouts, he is not worried, because he trusts his players: "You never want to come at penalty shootout, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the intense desire to hold the title in our hands, that left us something for this final game, and we hope that it will not happen this time".
It's in Romanso's power to go from being a two-time champion to experiencing the glory that titles bring for the first time.
US changes visa rules
Before the interview, the person must present himself at the visa application service, which reduces waiting times and costs.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa at the Embassy and Consulates of the United States of America will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the visa service (ASC) before their interview at the consulate.
The ASC staff will record the applicant's biometric data, which will be checked by the consulate before the interview.
The new method has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The overall cost of visa processing is reduced by no longer having to pay separately for the appointment, processing of the visa application and the transport service used to deliver the document.
The applicant makes only one single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for handlers and investors.
Those who only wish to renew their visas do not have to go to the consulate, but simply present themselves at the nearest ASC, where they are presented with their documents and fingerprinted.
As the biometric data is collected at the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the interview at the consulate will spend less time there than before.
Those who apply for the visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the $26 service surcharge.
The new visa application procedure is based on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency has called a press conference to announce tomorrow a discovery that will have implications for the search for life in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that may confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be announced at 1:00 p.m. tomorrow at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When convening the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a groundbreaking finding in the search for extraterrestrial life", which caused speculation among experts in other countries.
The discovery may support the theory that in hostile environments previously thought to be uninhabitable, human-like creatures may exist, and the hypothesis has been raised that they may evolve into intelligent creatures like humans if their living conditions improve.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, in an environment that has been deemed too toxic for all imaginable life because of the lake's high arsenic content.
In some ways, the microbes use arsenic as a survival resource, and taking this ability into account increases the chances that there could be life like this on other planets that don't have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms mix the arsenic, astrobiologists say, it is proved that "there is actually another life form, a second life form, different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the actual reach of its fund at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon) to see if its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
The reform of the law governing the Congress will introduce the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and an opposition bloc was already established, led by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented himself as an independent.
Before the opening session of the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the law of the legislature, as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a "two-party system" would be introduced, for now it would be two people, the same number as parties, who would control Congress.
These four members, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the presidium headed by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-chairman.
Corvera Quevedo explained that with these reforms, the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political marginalisation.
He explained that they would be speaking with the representatives of the PAN and PRI in the next few days to change the scheme, assuming that they had the political will and that if they did not have it, they would be subjugated by both parties, thus putting an end to the opposition coalition.
"This is how far I (the opposition coalition) have come, this is what I see, because we are excluded from all decision-making, they do not even take into account the opinion of others".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after having been monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of legislative reform that there should be a perpetual two-party system in Congress".
"To start with, this group starts with five MEPs and they talk to other colleagues to get more", the Convergencia member explained.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, in an allusion to PAN and PRI, said that the Congress had now turned into a 'prey' for two.
"It used to be one party, now they're splitting it in two".
Patrón Montalvo asked that the Members be respected and given their place at the negotiating table.
"We cannot be left out because of top decisions, five, which will probably be nine Members, the five, which are currently seen as divided into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table because of the reform that was carried out and agreed by the others, we have stayed out and we do not agree with this reform".
200 000 pesos more for the "supply woman"
The city of Mazatlán is paying another check to the disputed owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque for a little over 200,000 pesos was issued by the city to Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos.
The sum paid to the owner of the electrical equipment company in the second half of the year is therefore 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the city government, this check, numbered 9258447 and with an amount of 200.144,56 pesos, was issued on November 16 with the use of "accounting of outstanding accounts".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent ahead that more money from the municipality would go to this supplier, who is being monitored by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells at exorbitant prices.
What was not mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and, consequently, the number of checks still being drawn on behalf of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, just the debts are paid, just like the rest of the suppliers", he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the last one on November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when a company is called into question by ASE in order to avoid other administrations requesting its services, the Treasurer assured that its services would not be re-invoked.
After the newspaper Noroeste published on July 25 the audit of the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it became known that already before, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also transactions with Jumapam, where she cashed checks worth over 3 million pesos.
The tourist sites need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán requested the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in a bad state and that are giving a bad image to the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Chamber of Commerce, recalled that on several occasions there have been calls to take care of the destination and to turn the poor conditions that tourists encounter into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the roads and sidewalks had a negative effect, as tourists would come to stroll and see the mess, turning their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company one day, and they don't care how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't have carried out the construction work in this slow and haphazard way".
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist's fall had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and maintenance work by the city.
"The community has to take responsibility and prevent this from happening again, and how do they do that? Well, by preventative maintenance instead of fixing everything afterwards", he explained.
"We are eager to have a clean city. Not only because it is a tourist area, it needs to be maintained, but we residents also have a right to a clean living space. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition".
"There are other places that also look unfinished and untreated", he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán".
"Today, we need more than advertising to attract tourists, we need a good product, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean and its tourist attractions in good shape", he added.
"These measures have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents only expose what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed".
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Promoción Turística, stressed the importance of saving the tourist sites of Mazatlán, as they were not being used properly and were creating a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that should be brought to the fore along with the city, making the city clean, tidy and attractive to tourism should be a priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán has many historical and cultural sites that would need to be cleaned up and cleaned up first, to make them attractive to tourism and to add to the inventory with which we promote this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that the deputies should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business community is calling for a dignified parliament, free of collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is in turmoil and facing major problems.
The 60th Parliament was inaugurated yesterday and consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the Partido Nueva Alianza, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergencia and one of the PVEM.
New members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel a sense of duty to society and the various social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE Business Coordination Council, suggested that the new members should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that MEPs will really exercise their right to act free of collusion between parties, because it is common for them to make agreements representing their own interests, turning themselves into carnivals of the ruling class and the leaders of parliamentary factions".
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We make sure that they do a trustworthy job and that they are committed to the society and their groups above all else, because it was the people of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in them in the last elections".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives was to promote and work together for the economic growth of the state, because the economic situation is extremely complicated today.
"The most important thing is that they will drive economic growth, create incentives for investment and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation".
The Commission has also proposed that the Council adopt a directive on the protection of the environment by the protection of the environment and the prevention of pollution from industrial sources.
"I understand that it is the Ministry with the second-lowest resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry".
The tourism projects must be funded, the state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which was not re-drafted in previous legislatures, must be updated.
The Search for a Holy King
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family are eager to buy dolls, cars, bicycles, and other toys.
It will be difficult for the parents to fulfill these wishes on the next Three Kings day, for the household consists of no more and no less than twelve persons and a goat.
Despite this, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel never give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and the clothes they crave.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende, where they live hand to mouth, because the father has no steady job.
"Sometimes it's hard because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon I go with the puppies to sell them on the street", said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, four years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister, Isabel, wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting a 'monster car' for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests clothing in one-year-old sizes.
"He (José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would love that monster,' but I told him, 'let's wait, son,' because it was very expensive", Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11, is a size 12, Isaías, 10, and Miguel, 8, are a size 10.
José Juan, 14, is missing tennis shoes, so a pair in a size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the 'Holy King is Wanted' campaign by donating a toy or cash in the lobby of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, around ten searches were carried out in the Estrie administrative region as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and distribution network.
Fourteen people were arrested and are facing various charges.
The searches were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, locations believed to have been used primarily for the production of drugs.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment used in the production have been confiscated", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
In total, 11 men and three women were arrested, two of whom were from Sherbrooke, and the men who were thought to be the main organizers of the drug ring.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared hours after their arrest in front of the Sherbrooke courthouse.
They could be charged with, among other things, the production of cannabis, possession for the purpose of sale, conspiracy, and providing services of a criminal nature.
These searches were the result of a lengthy investigation that had been going on for over a year.
"The information obtained from public sources has enabled us to make these arrests", Mr Ruel said.
The police operation involved some 70 officers from the Estrien regional investigation unit, the Quebec security police, the Sherbrooke police service and the Memphrémagog police department.
The secret immigration could be easily traced
The Conservative bill, which the government says is intended to address the problem of ships carrying smuggled migrants, is expected to be pushed through, after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this charter".
"I stand with a party that has put shackles on your feet", Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff told the assembled MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argued that the bill, which would allow the detention of any person coming from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants for up to a year, violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, leader of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it was aimed at the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government does", explained Mr Duceppe.
The criticism of Olivia Chow, NDP, on the immigration issue has dismissed critics who claim her party did not behave firmly enough towards the illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats are in favour of taking action against the blind passengers and that is what we are trying to do through another bill, C-35", said Chow.
We therefore do not support the Conservative bill because it blames the refugees and keeps children trapped for at least a year", explained Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are telling MPs that they will not tolerate this kind of illegal immigration, this criminal activity that affects Canada and treats the country like a footnote".
"They expect Canada to take tough action", Minister Kenney's response was.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its bill, which could have led to elections in the country that the government has rejected.
However, a Conservative told the QMI news agency that the government would call a vote so that any opposition member of parliament could immediately address his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest of the possible creation of a new, permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public committee of inquiry into the matter.
Robert Dutil, the Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea is not new: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The Metropolis has had a standing anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Still, Wednesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It should be noted that this measure was not discussed at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was also not without its critic, Stéphane Bergeron, a member of the Parti Québécois, who qualified this announcement as "a rabbit out of the hat" and "a solution made up right on the table" in terms of public safety.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should adopt a new decision on the application of the principle of subsidiarity, which would allow the Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that the principle of subsidiarity is respected.
"You will see the result when we announce it", he said.
"You are aware of this problem".
According to Réjean Parent, president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public poll.
"The more M. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and me will think he has something to hide", he explained.
"The only way to form a committee of inquiry is for Jean Charest to resign", said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and political systems at the ENA (National School for the Training of Senior Administrative Officials).
The Commission's proposal is to give the financial control a special mandate to enable it to carry out investigations into corruption and collusion.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of the examination control", he decided.
He also believes that the Quebec could give the audit authority the same power as commissioners, which would also allow it to compel people to testify.
The creation of a standing unit is not the only project in the Charest government's drawers.
The Quebec government will also ask Ottawa to amend its criminal code to better deal with this type of crime.
This request comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier, that the case law is not clear in this type of prosecution.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Safety, confirmed that his colleague from the Ministry of Justice, Rob Nicholson, was currently dealing with certain amendments to this dossier.
During Operation Spring 2001, which involved groups of motorcycle police, 131 people were arrested, although the criminal code had not been amended.
Ottawa has enforced the gangsterism law as a result.
Rivers under strict control
Several river courses remain under strict surveillance due to the heavy rainfall that has been pouring into some parts of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, Mauricie, a landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses have been evacuated as a precaution.
The Commission has also received a letter from the French authorities, stating that the Commission had not yet received the information it had requested.
A street collapsed in the process.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall of 40 to 70 milliliters of precipitation has fallen in several regions.
Between 20 and 40 millimetres of rainfall were expected here, depending on the region, by Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were the most affected.
In all, up to 100 millimeters of rain had fallen here.
In addition to the snow melt, which has already accumulated in certain parts of the country, there is a danger that several streams may be overrun.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued flood warnings for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The river courses in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière, are monitored and will continue to be monitored.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused the flooding of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a bridge was torn down by heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a precautionary measure.
In the Outaouais, the flooding of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and is closely monitoring the situation, said Security Adviser Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec National Dry Water Centre on Wednesday issued warnings of the sharp rise of several rivers, especially the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly reprimanded
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a setback from the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Board (CCNR) for his controversial remarks about social welfare and Haitians, as well as his unconventional radio talk.
The CCNR is of the opinion that while Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their own opinions, certain statements "have included inaccurate information about social welfare and unjustifiably negative representations of Haitians, as well as such crude speech that is not appropriate for daytime broadcasts".
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion of suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two people who had committed suicide was contrary to the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints about the comments made during the 2008-2010 broadcasts.
The first order was made following a complaint lodged by the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
The moderators should rather give sound than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, presenter Stéphane Dupont had expressed the opinion that suicide is an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Supervisory Board concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Board of Directors considers that the implications of the 'Dupont le midi' programme have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner".
Therefore, he was not held personally responsible for any wrongdoing.
The last point of contention was the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had a very effective debate on this subject, which generated a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had stated that he had not donated to Haiti aid because it was not certain that the needy would actually receive the money.
The Board of Directors believes that these comments were not abusive in nature, but that their cumulative effect is to present a wrongly negative image of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension on this case".
"My record has been virgin for a year and a half", explained the presenter.
In all its decisions, the Supervisory Board denounces the spread of uncouth language.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcasting company acted 'beyond its obligations'.
The consequences for the broadcaster, which was required to communicate its decisions within a period of three days, once during the main broadcasting time, are minor.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, a Montreal native of Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who excels in "Sanda" (full contact kung fu), kickboxing and Thai boxing, now climbs the Tatami and the world's boxing rings in search of new challenges.
"I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria", said Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally look for fighting everywhere, because for those who do not like ground fighting as presented by mixed martial arts, competitive fighting in North America is rare".
Recently, the security guard and UPS employee had given his rival bad news, winning two World Karate and WKA gold medals at the World Amateur Championship, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, from October 23 to 30.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and the Thai boxing categories", he explained.
"I'm currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China".
"Those fighters from each category who had placed in the top four at the last world championship were invited".
"I got the babe in 2009 in Toronto Bronze".
"I became eight in Vietnam in 2005.
"I finished fifth in the 2007 tournament in China, while I came third in 2009 in Toronto", he added.
"It's worth noting that I've made progress in every competition".
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
San Shou or Sanda is a Chinese discipline that allows punches and kicks as well as throws.
The matches are usually held on a platform, rarely in a boxing ring.
The most famous boxer to come out of this form of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal were to withhold just one event in his career, he would surely call his attendance at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest ranking and most respected in China", explained the sympathetic Pfundskerl.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)".
"That was a super experience".
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semifinals of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The man who beat me was a real pro", he analyzed.
"There are four contestants per weight class (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg).
"The winners of the semi-finals will meet in the finals of their respective categories".
"Then the winners of each category will face off to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu".
450 million in contracts without call for tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in contracts to project design firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project by mutual agreement.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor has obtained the largest share, namely that of the project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without a call for tenders.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was created in 2004 as a result of Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over its responsibility for this important $5 billion hydroelectric project to the private sector.
In early 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of business consortia is a serious ethical problem, which raises the risk of distortion of competition and price increases.
"This is a new way of playing a rigged game and it discourages competition".
"This means that instead of playing games in secret, they are now playing games in the open", Sylvain Simard, a PQ Member of Parliament, told a press conference yesterday.
Simard had raised the issue in the National Assembly in the early morning, because he found it difficult to understand how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister for Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, had reacted this afternoon by vehemently denying that this contract was a game played out.
"I remain true to my line", she said, adding that the PQ had acted "unfairly" and "lacked toughness".
She said it was the least the PQ could do to apologize.
The consortium model is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance of this type, which allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in relation to a bid to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is highly complex in terms of its scope of work.
The construction process is underway and is expected to be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competition; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the Quebec consortium model is no longer an exception even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper Le Devoir noted last week, the consortium model applied in the field of civil engineering and consultancy is the subject of government investigations.
A quick glance at the Quebec register of companies reveals more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be of permanent existence.
In this way, Dessau, for example, is working in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche and Tecsult.
Every link, and there are several dozen, leads back to the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
As regards the Energy Governance Consortium, Minister Normandeau emphasised that 'the Baie James area is subject to a particular labour force dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been taking this fact into account in a particular way since the 1970s'.
Réal Laporte, the major employer of Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement which has been very critical of the fact that the contract for the project management was awarded by agreement.
"If you have a call for tenders and there are only a few applicants, your prices will skyrocket".
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this Mart and you say to yourself: 'We will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price.'"
"The idea is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people", Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than 50 000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After reviewing the documents, Le Devoir counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts awarded to companies or their subsidiaries, including, in particular, ResourceLabors, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had won 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not including their participation in Énergie gérance.
All these contracts have been negotiated.
The total amount of the loan is $449 783 344, including the contract with Énergie gérance, which is $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had indicated that the four firms forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the Parti libéral du Québec.
Minister Normandeau had suggested that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that "financed" it, before clarifying that it was more about their executives.
The 'green' label is not a confidence-building indicator
Green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also in the brands or eco-labels that are supposed to guide his choice.
It is a pity that it is bathed in a media-influenced universe, where information abounds in favour of responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption laments a lack of credible information, an insufficiency that is a brake on its commitment, as the first reading held yesterday showed.
Despite driving up consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebecers admit that they have no faith in the environmental commitment of companies, nor in green business advertising, according to the measuring instrument developed by the Responsible Consumer Centre at the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers have doubts about the credibility of official certificates attached to supposedly fair products, but also about the credibility of products and brands that declare themselves as environmentally conscious, according to the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of the population of Quebec takes the discourse of politicians on this issue seriously.
Nevertheless, information on responsible consumption seems to be important in stimulating this segment of consumption, which is currently consumed by only about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the emptiness and doubtfulness of the information dampened the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer, after the higher price of products.
In addition, one third of Quebecois are distrustful of the stated performance of the green products and services that are being put on their hands.
According to another report, in 2010, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits, mainly changing the brand of one or more products to express their beliefs.
According to the Barometer, 61% of them also preferred to shop at local retailers and to buy food grown in their own region.
Green and responsible - the Eco-conscious Consumption Index this year reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 - the Homo Consumus of Quebec likes to present himself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce his footprint in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But social and environmental awareness seems to be a priority, according to the Barometer: just 28% of Quebecers said they used public transport or shared transportation in 2010 to demonstrate their environmental interest.
Walking and cycling were also favoured by 39.1% of the respondents in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds the clichés.
State bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which had been invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXescentris cinema complex, agreed to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The developers Angus and Parallèle, who had hoped for a grant of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to take over the eXcentris cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, which belonged to Daniel Langlois, in order to restore it to its original cinematic function, apparently did not get what they wanted.
The government has agreed to get involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a lower-than-initially-expected loan that could create a viable solution on favorable terms, at least according to sources familiar with the government's rumour-mongering.
The first action plan and a request for 12.8 million were rejected by Quebec last spring, and the request has since been revised downwards somewhat.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is in charge of the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final report.
The Cabinet's counterproposal was, however, sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to respond to this.
In any event, the premise of public funding seems to have been pushed to the side.
Recall that the Quebec Cinema Owners Association had opposed direct government investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there that he had not given to other cinemas.
However, several other market players in the segment claimed substantial economic aid.
Cinema director Daniel Langlois had presented the author's cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years under great difficulties after the construction of the cinema financed by himself, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of independent movie theaters is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep its clientele on the edge.
The Société Angus and the Parallèle company, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are also leading a privately financed campaign, from which they hope to raise $700 000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future purchasers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the highly successful film by Xavier Beauvois, "Des hommes et des dieux".
But Christian Yaccarini did not call the newspaper Le Devoir, and what he and his group think of the downward-adjusted proposals that have been made to them is ignored.
The secret of the complex shaken Canada aired
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal the secret of what the United Nations considers the inferiority complex of Canadians to Americans, but they also reveal the superiority of the latter to Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voter is not thinking of Canada-US relations when voting, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the Conservative government to push through its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were released to the public yesterday, offer even more tantalizing details than the mere substance of the matter, which one has to nibble on.
A link from September 22, 2008, i.e. when the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations no longer participates in the missions discussed by its political leaders.
To the astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador to Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
"A complex of inferiority that is almost inherent in Canadians may be conditionally inducing Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life rather than to blame the United States for this election (as in 1988 with the free trade campaign)", he writes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too menacing to speak of".
The Ambassador understands this "dull silence" all the less because the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically", he said, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and even more so of a party leader to conduct such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in the ballot box".
The other expression of this sense of importance is found in the message sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, the Ottawa businessman, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the continuation of the government's confidence vote on the federal budget in early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade, resulting from a $30-$40 billion stimulus program", Breese says.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent the coalition from toppling the parliament and that the continued existence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed stimulus programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008, written by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the CBC dramatic series broadcast from the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about programmes such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are few subtle references to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or even abductions for the purpose of interrogations carried out by CIA muscle.
Another report gives details of how Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, at their first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to take in certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question in the affirmative, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it is described, 'he handed the Secretary of State a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.'
"The Secretary of State has agreed to review the file".
Finally, let us note that there is a heated debate about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old adviser and very close to Stephen Harper, had declared on CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He was referring to Mike Huckabee of the United States.
The world-wide plan to renew lighting
The UN yesterday in Cancun proposed a plan to renew the lighting of homes, commerce and industry in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions equivalent to nearly one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in line with the concrete major projects which the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
The plan presented yesterday would avoid the main problem of 1.8 billion tonnes of CFCs being emitted to the earth as a result of lighting if the white-glowing bulbs, which have so far held a monopoly of 50 to 70% of the market, were replaced by fluorescent or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the exhaust gases from the world's fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But we would have to subtract 5 Gt from that balance to stabilize the climatic rise by 2 degrees Celsius between now and 2020, to prevent it from going out of control.
In the white-hot bulbs, 95 percent of the energy escapes as heat, and the remaining 5 percent produces light.
The compact fluorescent lamps reduce energy consumption by 75%, while the new LED lamps reduce this energy demand by a further two-fold.
The average life of compact fluorescent lamps is between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched this week by the manufacturer Philips - which, by the way, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white light bulb, which gives an indication of the savings of the replacement scheme to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these brand new bulbs emit very little heat, they can also operate with a standard resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have pointed out that compact fluorescent lamps have reserves because they contain mercury and therefore have to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless producers provide a recycling point.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, however, is not the CFL, but coal-fired power plants, which emit much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-hot bulbs, according to the report.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury every year.
The report details the gains that each country would make from these international programmes.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion dollars to build.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, immediately after the deadline.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to continue its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay", a spokesman for the UN chief said.
'He asks all Ivorian parties and institutions to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.'
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the Electoral Commission had allowed the deadline set for Wednesday at midnight to pass three days after the election on Sunday without publishing the results.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would 'continue its work' to announce the results.
The European Parliament has already called on the Commission to present a report on the situation in the European Union.
The Gbagbo camp, however, expects the annulment by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, obtained by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the Ivory Coast presidential campaign manager, had confirmed that the FN's tactics of intimidating voters in the north of the country had discouraged the president's supporters from going to the polls.
The entire election could be annulled if Gbagbo's lawsuits are considered by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo's opponents are now more inclined to believe that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politician with close ties to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has called the delay in the announcement of the election results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect it, even if he did not go as far as to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knows he lost; and filing a complaint in the Constitutional Court after preventing the Electoral Commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of Sunday's presidential election was held to crown the process of unification and reconciliation of a country that has been divided in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round of the elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes, compared to 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France stable in third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolitan area according to the International Labour Office (IAA) (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to preliminary seasonally adjusted data published by the Federal Statistical Office (Insee) on Thursday.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis stands at 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolitan area and 9.7% including the overseas departments.
The unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points over the year.
In general, 3.4 million of the French metropolitan area's workers were unemployed in the third quarter but wished to find work, including whether they were fit for work every two weeks or not, and whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate, with the unemployment rate rising by 24.2% in the metropolitan area (+0.9 percentage points in three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and by 25% when the overseas regions are included.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the 15-24 year olds were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The elderly, for their part, recorded a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolitan area (+0.2 percentage points over three months and the year), i.e. 482 000 over-50s, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year-olds benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter: 8.3% in the metropolitan area (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage point over a year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Following a dispute over its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office (BFS) has not published monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues with this method, announcing on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, the head of a waste management company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône (PS) region, was investigated and sent to prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public and suspected fraudulent markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with embezzlement of company assets, misappropriation of public property, bribery, complicity in corruption, unauthorized bribery and weapons possession, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is prepared to fight and intends to answer any questions asked by the prosecution, instead of spreading speculation".
"It is easy to accuse him of a number of criminal charges, it is another thing to prove them", his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP (Agence France Presse) before his client's hearing.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Socialist Party) in the department, had insisted that, before his hearing, his lawyers should send the judge a memorandum justifying his action.
A Guérini associate, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and jailed Wednesday night.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill running.
As regards the area of business competence or the destination of the associated funds, he would never have been aware of it, according to Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the public service of the Aubagne conurbation, was also charged on Wednesday with embezzlement and complicity, but was then released on the condition that he stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide an explanation for the facts alleged against him".
"The chief prosecutor has considered not to deprive him of his freedom", said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released from custody overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under judicial supervision, according to Deputy Prosecutor General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director of the waste management company Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "illegal influence and passive bribery".
Two civil servants from the Aubagne conurbation, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the grounds of "fraud and embezzlement of public property by a public official", the other on the grounds of "complicity in the embezzlement of public funds".
The wife of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "fraud and embezzlement of social assets".
Among those confronted by Guérini was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in connection with a similar case of public fraud in Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company of helping launder money from high-level crime rings.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste disposal branch, is ongoing in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
The investigation is based on information obtained from sources close to the case, and is particularly concerned with the conditions of the contract and the operation of a landfill site in La Ciotat, which also receives waste from the Aubagne area and from certain towns in the urban catchment area of Marseille (MPM).
The Clotilde Reiss affair: the Elysée Palace is overreaching in its role as a mediator for Syria
For more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "spying", kept the French public breathless, put diplomacy on alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the watchful eyes of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and seen by the newspaper Le Monde reveal some of the background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French women did not compensate for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian man held in France and wanted by the US for trafficking in materials for Iran's nuclear weapons program.
Finally, they cast a very strong light on the way in which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media in order to make it appear that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, he had done nothing to that effect.
A diplomatic telegram, written in Paris on 12 August 2009, is entitled 'Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage-taking'.
The French Foreign Minister, Mr François Richier, assisted by Mr Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, and the Elysée's Adviser on Strategy, had a meeting with the American diplomat, Ms Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do everything possible to bring back their own citizens who were being held forcibly in Iran.
"Make a noise", they said, "articulate loud and clear and without pause" the words "fundamental human rights", "guilt", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more because the Iranians are asking you not to do it".
Because "silence solves nothing", bypassing the attempts to discuss in inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters of evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common Iranian tactic": "Hostage-taking for the purpose of political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was to take place on 16 August, the day she escaped to the French embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euro bail.
And he says the Elysée is anticipating more hostage-taking, a phenomenon that will "exacerbate".
The Iranians "could arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future", he said.
28th of August 2009.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the European Union is able to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
The news has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition from Iran is being sought by the United States for illegal trade in sensitive electronic materials, has been released from custody by a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of acquiring nuclear material, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France bought a cow trade ?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French ?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysee, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision" but also tried to oppose it.
"There was a lively exchange between the French presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision", he explains.
Mr Richier also wishes to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under the "strict" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée advisor dials a phone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in the buildings managed by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
The Elysée does not spare the efforts made by Clotilde Reiss in Iran during her detention, to make it appear, by means of public statements and "flight tests" organised by the media, that the Syrian President, Bashar Al-Assad, is playing an "important" and "influential intermediary role".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and note that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles mirror the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 calls for "the media blitz of the French authorities".
The Paris embassy wonders what all the "gratitude" to Mr Assad is based on.
"Despite their laudatory statements, the French authorities admit secretly that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done".
The document then examines the reasons which led the Elysée to abandon this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria", he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008 which was then "perceived by numerous critical voices in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
"Building the Syrian role" is an attempt by Paris to "show Syria the rewards that can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to " sow discord between Syria and Iran ".
The American Embassy has this information from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier confided in her: "of course we do not know what the Syrians have done".
"But we thanked them anyway".
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss is to return to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy is receiving them at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our fellow citizens".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the ashtray" that will ban young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have indicated.
A bill to require online gaming operators to deny access to these games to young people under 16 after midnight will be presented to parliament in December, representatives of the ministries of culture and family said.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning in school and also having a normal life during the day".
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep", Jo Rin, the minister responsible for drafting the law, told Agence France Presse.
The online games are then available again from 6 a.m.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the term 'commercial vehicle' to cover vehicles with a maximum mass exceeding 100 kg.
The government is also considering asking manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for access to these games for those young people whose parents ask for it, the official added.
It will also provide free software to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion in global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals against 58 other nations at the World Cyber Games.
2018-2022 FIFA World Cup: The host country has been announced
In a fit of excitement over alleged corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee will on Thursday name the hosts of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political election in which the race for influence and lobbying threaten to push technical criteria into the background.
One thing is certain: the 2018 edition of the FIFA King's Cup will be held in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be a little more exotic; the International Football Federation hopes to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who make up the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Ministers, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an indication of the economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
So the machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop at the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates otherwise.
According to the evaluation report of FIFA, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important to the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the forefront of the revelations, including the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have just as easily ruined the chances of its own country, the cradle of football, which has only been allowed to host the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC had fed the matter on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that took aim at three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's financial interests are protected.
The Prime Minister hopes to repeat the success of his predecessor, Tony Blair, who won the London 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Would this intensive work be enough to restore England's image in the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the Spain-Portugal duo is not lacking in trophies with its already completed stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downsides of both countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport), has become a major outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided to denounce the unabashed reference to the English press's observations as "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the committee members.
"They are being smeared, they are being compromised", Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorite.
First economic world power, home to the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately put forward a very nice project.
But these new candidates seem premature for two countries that co-hosted the 2002 contest.
Another threat is the FIFA's coveted 2026 World Cup bid to China, which will see Asian bids for the 2022 tournament postponed.
With Australia and Qatar having all but pulled the plug with the introduction of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion into new territories, but these two countries are a greater risk than a certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights acquired by European countries (due to the time shift), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
The second mandate: transparency
De Gaulle was really into it.
Mitterand had made him believe that he was a stutterer.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than this one.
A mandate at the Elysée calls forth the next one.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not a good reflection of the mystery that surrounds the presidency.
So you have to pretend that the doubt is there from now on.
In one sense, as in the other.
In 2006, the followers of Jacques Chirac said that a third term was not out of the question, without believing in it themselves.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy said in a serious tone that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he was going to announce the prospect of "two mandates" to the UMP parliamentarians at the Elysée on Tuesday evening had caused a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy ?
I miss you.
The President merely recalled that the constitutional amendment of 2008 limits the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election in a humorous tone at such meetings.
"You have seven and a half years with me at worst, or at best", he told them in July 2009.
In a May 2010 news story, "Don't think I don't think about the after phase".
His words of the day before yesterday do not make him more candidate than the day before yesterday; but neither do they make him less.
If they do, it is for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
It is not the recording of the competition with Ségolène Royal that forces Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that many members of the PS are urging to fight earlier than expected.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to a survey by BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion with the UMP about it", the Prime Minister's entourage reacted immediately and cautiously.
"If he thought defeat was possible, he would not be a candidate", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win", corrects Alain Juppé, who has come to terms with the open-mindedness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the ECB's central bank last year should have been an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the ordering of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures, which are due to be completed by the end of the year.
The European debt crisis is a major factor in the European debt crisis, and the Frankfurt central bank cannot afford to lose sight of the current tense situation in the European bond markets, in order to avoid worsening it.
The political cost of this would be far too high.
The European Council has adopted a resolution on the situation of the European Union's debt, which is a very important step towards the achievement of a common European policy.
It did not venture to say whether it thought the central bank could do more, for example by stepping up its sovereign bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my thoughts for my European trading partners (...) ".
The President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, had not been very eloquent about his intentions when he was heard by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament in Brussels the day before, but had simply pointed out that the programme of purchases of government bonds on the secondary market would be 'continued' and that we would 'see what the decisions are' at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty is that the ECB will leave its key rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, Treasury bond purchases were doubled by the ECB last week to about €1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
The expectation of a continuation of the buying price is not in any way doubted by the traders (see page 29).
Economists are already expecting no noticeable change in the exchange rate.
The ECB will be able to draw on its unlimited cash reserves in a free way for a period of one week to three months, after the loan transactions of more than three months have been removed from the ECB's arsenal.
The Commission has already taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Community's financial resources are used to the full.
"I cannot see the ECB changing its programme in any substantial way".
"Otherwise, it would risk provoking new tensions in the short term", suspects Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me", anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
I'm going to Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the sovereign debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of bond purchases as to revive the sluggish market", adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the euro area sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must at all costs go to the shortage of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent premature enthusiasm about the yields paid to the weakest countries", a major bond holder testified yesterday.
The European Union has a long way to go before it can be fully satisfied with the results of the European Monetary System.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
The Berlusconi government is taking cover in Italy
After a start of the week that was worrying for Italy, the situation eased a little yesterday with the fall in the key interest rates to 10 years.
A return to the deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regional presidents had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "unpredictable" and expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which he immediately denied.
On Tuesday, the German interest rate slide reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy rose to 263 points, causing a certain sense of disorientation in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that the discrepancy between Spain's and Germany's interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, had expressed "grave concern" about the "market turbulence" and the possible risk of contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland".
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal", explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain language, this means that his problem is the absence of economic growth and the accompanying, meagre tax revenues, which put the state in danger of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts have been a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget submitted to the Senate for consideration is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates that the budget deficit will still be 4.3% of GDP next year (against the 3.9% predicted by the governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
That is why there is a great deal of excitement about a new budgetary authority, which could be set up after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken", says the auditor Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are in order, as we have been saying for a long time", assures Arrigo Sadun, the Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short or long term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.R.), is less likely to make progress towards stabilisation than other countries", observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Chief Economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence from the Chamber of Deputies, which could lead to the early elections being organised at the end of March.
The period ahead is therefore not a good one for taking decisions on a major crisis.
Europeans are thinking about the expansion of crisis management
The European Parliament has been a very active participant in the process of European integration, and it is not only the European Parliament that has been involved, but also the European Parliament, which has been involved in the process of European integration.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting is a very important one.
But there is no sign of a start to the process of normalisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce the debt rating of Portugal, which is probably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political awareness, which particularly affects the banking systems", said the economist of Exane BNP Paribas.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council on the subject of the future of the internal market.
The European countries, aware of both this gap and the danger it represents, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
The informal consultations between the most directly concerned Finance Ministers and, more broadly, their G20 counterparts are progressing well.
And this also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan is to use a lot of unconventional measures to support the eurozone countries in the cross-section of the markets (see below).
As for the EU Stability Fund, its Executive Director Klaus Regling began his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments in the European crisis.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicitly fundraising, he is certainly preparing the ground for it.
The first paper issues of the EU Stability Fund are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday an official American representative told Reuters that the United States supported a possible increase in the funds mobilised by the additional direct involvement of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries at the top, are preparing to introduce structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
The Commission has also proposed a number of reforms in addition to the austerity measures, but with effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are going down a different path from Greece and Ireland.
Both sides want to avoid, at all costs, having to ask for international help before they have drawn up their own budgetary correctives and decided on the necessary structural reforms that will restore their confidence in the long term.
European investors are discussing options for speeding up the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was in Paris on 24 November, was the first to suggest that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to reach for its own pockets again.
The economists at Barclays Capital, the leading player in the European sovereign debt market, estimate that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
The European financial stability mechanism is in existence, and currently stands at EUR 60 billion.
The Council has every chance of being closely examined in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are rising.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in Orange alert
The snow still causes traffic difficulties, particularly in the secondary transport networks of Brittany, and threatens to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on alert level orange due to the threat of snow and ice.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne regions have joined the 20 departments already in Orange alert, 18 since midday Wednesday and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall is expected in the north of Gironde and the Charentes, and light snowfall in the Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow cover of 2 to 5 cm, and in some places 7 to 10 cm, is expected, and 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is large enough to cause traffic disruption and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy goods vehicles of more than 7,5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac roads.
The traffic situation in the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using one's own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER travel busses was cancelled throughout the day.
Schools in Picardie have been cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were planned for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "asks motorists to exercise extreme caution on the roads and to adapt their driving behavior accordingly".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Paris Roissy airport and 10% of flights from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB advises passengers to contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in south London and Edinburgh airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
The first financial sketches of the Grand Paris Metro
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in the Île-de-France has been in full swing, billions have been pouring down.
At least in the discussions.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council, and I hope that the Council will be able to take a more positive view of the situation.
To start construction of the SGP, the state has announced a capital grant of 4 billion euros.
In theoretical terms, this is the amount that would allow the SGP to lend on the markets a fraction of the sum of its twofold.
Today, finally, the first calculations have been made.
The supplementary budget for 2010, which was reviewed this morning by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
The measures are twofold: the introduction of a special tax on the acquisition of offices and a higher tax on the offices in the Ile-de-France.
The first, according to Article 15 of the draft law, is 'for the benefit of the publicly owned establishment Société du Grand Paris'.
The figure is: "The proceeds of this tax amount to EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a reorganization of the existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it, to increase the product resulting from it and to pass this increase on to the Société Grand du Paris".
How much would that bring in?
It's a riddle.
This sum is not stated in the text.
Of the four billion, you're far away.
'It is stated that the tax resources are added to the EUR 4 billion of capital raised by the State and paid to Société du Grand Paris in stages for the project', according to the explanatory memorandum.
The SGP does not find this system offensive.
"From the moment you enter the revenue (the two taxes, d.R.) you can cover the projection for three years and then draw from the 4 billion", it explains.
"This will be recorded in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will be the beginning of the recording of the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose promised 4 billion will be long overdue, is in danger of provoking a very lively parliamentary debate.
The first public hearing will take place on 7 December.
Hacking with a Vengeance and Spying With a Purpose
The WikiLeaks affair has a double meaning.
On the one hand, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal which is only a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy which governs the relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes on an international level, and gives a foretaste of a future dominated by regression.
But we'll take it one step at a time.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by any intelligence agency of any nation is made up entirely of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits are nothing more than what you've been reading for months in any magazine (except those owned by Berlusconi), and the horrifyingly caricatured profile of Gaddafi has long been a source of entertainment for cabaret artists.
The rule that the secret dossiers must be only news already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a library devoted to esoteric publications, you will find that each work (on the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly repeats what has already been written in previous works.
This is not merely because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (nor because he does not know where to find news about the nonexistent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown's success mechanism.
So are the classified files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited in spirit) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be anything, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers as true what he acknowledges.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department was the same as the one that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why such a fuss over the disclosures of these files?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows: that the embassies - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have become, with the exception of a few small representative functions, spy centres.
Any casual viewer of detective films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore this.
However, the fact that it is being publicly repeated violates the duty of hypocrisy and serves to cast a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a random hacker can access the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Moreover, the scandal brings less victims than "executioners" into trouble.
But let's get to the deep nature of what happened.
Back in Orwell's day, you could harness all power like a Big Brother, controlling every move of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have been proved to be perfectly true, where one could control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway chosen and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But when you consider what's happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can't escape the control of a hacker, the control flow stops being one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen's avenger - can unlock the secrets of power.
But how can a power sustain itself when it is no longer able to guard its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel has already said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secrets, since it reveals the public sphere; but to reveal, in the style of WikiLeaks, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets is to deprive her of any power.
WikiLeaks did not wrong Sarkozy or Merkel, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this insult to such a great power?
It is obvious that in future, states will no longer post any classified information online - that would be like putting a sign on a street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with today's technology, it is futile to hope to keep confidential telephone messages secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state is on a plane and has contacted one of his colleagues.
How could relationships be kept private and reserved for certain ears in the future?
I know that my prediction sounds like science fiction and romance at the moment, but I am forced to imagine the government agents, secretly moving along uncontrollable routes, carrying their messages nowhere but in their memory, and hiding the little written information they have in their shoes.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: in fact, the Watergate spy attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology today is advancing like a cancer, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet is reconstructing a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogue) videocassettes had enabled film researchers to study a film tape by tape, by rewinding from the back to the front and exposing all the secrets of the editing, whereas the (numerical) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro proportions.
High-speed trains take three hours to get from Rome to Milan, whereas an airplane takes three and a half hours, including the changeover.
It is not unusual, therefore, that politics and communication technology are coming back to the car and the horse.
One last observation, please.
In the past, the press has tried to understand what secrets were forged between the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that are demanding confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France is making good on its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the implementation of the rapidly solved financing commitments (also known as 'fast start' or early financing) made by the developing countries.
And already the crude French euphemisms have been exposed.
The Copenhagen Accord commits developing countries to provide 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged €7.2 billion over three years, France €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU did everything to convince its partners of its commitment to fast-start financing: detailed progress reports from its Member States, press conference, major side events, distribution of brochures.
The operation of transparency is remarkable and appreciated for its own value: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries doing the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look at the details, things are a little more complicated.
This money was to be 'new and additional' according to the Copenhagen Treaty, to ensure that additional effort was made without detriment to ODA.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark that he considers best.
The EU Commission, for example, has chosen to set the guideline for the 2009 programme: international financing will be maintained and 150 million will be added to it over three years as part of the 'fast start' funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of years or terms at the official development assistance level.
In contrast, France considered that the financing of 'all new projects' in 2010 was 'new and additional'.
In other words, there are no benchmarks for the previous year's expenditure or at the global level of official development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease) - France claims to be honouring its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into grants and loans.
There is no rule yet, and each person chooses his own way of calculating.
Some, such as France, consider €1 borrowed to be equivalent to €1 donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to accept: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often emission-reduction projects based on the most efficient technology) can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro as the equivalent of a euro donated... Furthermore, only the cost of the loan to the donor country should be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has no other reason than to "respect" its commitment of 420 million by taking 91.5% of the loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5% (36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to see for yourself.
France is the only EU country that uses loans on a large scale.
Germany is asking for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are meeting their obligations 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends 1 euro to meet its obligations, France spends just 10 cents, and understands this as a similar commitment.
That's some trick!
In the short term, the French authorities are operating a double-dealing in their fast-start financing: on the one hand, with the development of the action over time, and on the other hand, with the reality of the financial commitment.
France succeeds in making people believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promises, thus saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect, firstly within the EU (why do the other member states continue to donate if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries cannot be completely deceived...
The chapter on early financing is only a small issue in a relatively short time compared to the whole of the climate debate.
But it could be the last straw in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is imperative that he learn his lesson from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting system for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and of balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, however, France could advance the debate on the controversial nature of long-term financing (another crucial issue which is currently being discussed): the question of the 'availability' or the accounting nature of its loans cannot be avoided.
France could change its position to be as progressive on the issues in dispute as it is on other things.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "traceability" and the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussion.
Alert - pesticide ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals a day, according to a study released Wednesday by the Générations Futures (formerly the Movement for the Protection of the Rights and Respect of Future Generations) Association.
The association, which states that its results "do not represent a statistical significance in view of the small number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem under consideration", had bought between July and September the food normally consumed by a child of about ten years of age in the course of four meals plus a snack in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendation of five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products, and one and a half liters of water a day - have been tested by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals, and other contaminants, as well as for dairy products.
The balance sheet is staggering: 81 chemicals, including 42 classified as possibly or probably carcinogenic and five classified as certain carcinogens, as well as 37 endocrine disrupting substances, according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical substance ingested are not exceeded in the majority of cases, the survey does a good job of highlighting the reality of potential exposure to carcinogens or endocrine disrupting substances", notes the association.
Even at breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three that have been proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, contains traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, including those used for lunch, which the study found to contain traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
Also, the ham, tuna, even the baguette and the gum were laced with pesticides and other chemicals.
The analysis of the tap water revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak was the "highest" with 34 chemical residues, and even the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not uncontaminated.
The final risk of this "harmful cocktail" to the consumer "is likely to be underestimated", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed, in view of the urgency of the situation, a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the increase in civilization diseases.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
