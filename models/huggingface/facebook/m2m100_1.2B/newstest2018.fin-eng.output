Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed as a mental illness and now she’s doing art on the subject – “Man should have the right to his own body”
On the roof of the Academy’s Project Room gallery hang dozens of patient reports.
Each of them contains Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a long story of how outsiders have written up their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
He decided for him who he was.
“I wanted to share my personal treatment history so that the violent nature of the process could be seen,” Auer says.
In the process, he refers to the process of sexual correction.
It is often a period of years of study that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will be initiated by referring to the "gender identity disorder" diagnosis studies, which will be carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process began four years ago.
Even before that, he had used the estrogen he ordered via the Internet and was still very long on his own repair process.
She felt she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, the person must go through a correction process in order for the sex to be corrected also legally.
The Trans-Law (563/2002) requires forced sterilization of transgender persons in order to obtain the correct gender, for example, in the population register and in the passport.
At present, every sex corrector is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of reproductive disability.
People have the right to decide about their own body.
“This situation is intolerable and violates human rights,” Auer said.
Translation has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The United Nations Human Rights Council has issued eight observations on the law and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling that obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to sovereignty.
The previous Finnish government prepared the amendment under the leadership of then-Social and Health Minister Susanne Huovinen.
Elections were held and the Republicans came into government.
The law is now stopped again.
This is an internal dispute that has nothing to do with this law.
“The government doesn’t want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law,” said Frank Johansson, director of Amnesty’s Finnish department.
The front of the exhibition hall is dominated by two large installations.
The second one consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the Patient Report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the transpol psychologist’s interpretation of Auer at Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and, based on these, wrote a report that would define Auer’s right to care and help.
The sense of reality that is being examined appears to be exposed to shattering.
The person’s perception of self appears to be dispersed at the border level and the unstable personality traits are emphasized.
He did not recognize himself in these descriptions.
“It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as a mental illness,” Auer says.
Even more shocking was the fact that Auer was not granted treatment for gender correction.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not enough to start the process.
He was denied his identity.
Then, on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transpol’s waiting show on television.
Later from that television came the artwork called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflected on his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person who is defined as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but a diagnosis is needed to remove their breasts," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are other than the number of your gender defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer’s experience is not the only one of its kind.
For many, the process of sexual correction is harder for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who have to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
“It’s crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment on the grounds that they don’t have enough resources,” Auer says.
Many people who are involved in the process have psychological symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, possible experiences of bullying.
With reference to these, the medical staff may order that treatment cannot be started.
“Stopping treatment and receiving help can put a person in a worse situation than it was before the process started,” Auer says.
Auer’s personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: “I’ve had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that’s something that people usually find hard to digest.”
Depression has been treated with medications and when Auer started using hormones, he felt relieved.
She had finally been able to express the feelings that had already existed in childhood and adolescence.
Why a wide jaw didn’t seem to fit into your body and why your chest muscles needed to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people near him who see him.
Meeting is a basic need.
“You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using the sound, and moving,” she says.
Nowadays, Auer feels he’s coming to be seen, he exists as a woman.
At the beginning of the process, however, the accidental comments of close relatives could hurt a lot.
It hurts most when people are abused.
"They should know and they know who I am, but will not agree or be able to internalize it," he continues.
However, not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from kehodysphoria, or body disorder, in which the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long process of research, it is impossible to get an official confirmation of their own gender.
“There is no medical basis for these studies,” Auer says.
And it is true.
For example, in Denmark, in June 2014, Parliament approved a new procedure for the recognition of legal gender.
The new legislation is based on sovereignty over legal gender.
The applicant of a majority shall submit a written application for a new ID stating that he or she feels to be of the other gender.
After a six-month consideration period, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the Ministry grants the applicant a new ID.
This right to self-determination is also demanded in Finland, and this demand is also reflected in Auer’s exhibition.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but a collection of political and artistic works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.

Civil rights organization issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National Organization for Civil Rights of African Americans (NAACP) has issued a travel warning for Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory practices and racist attacks.
“The NAACP Missouri Travel Bulletin, which comes into effect on 28 August 2017, calls on African American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, which has recently experienced numerous questionable racial events,” the organization said in a statement.
A law recently enacted in Missouri makes it difficult to bring discrimination cases to justice. Furthermore, the enforcement of the state’s laws is disproportionately targeting minorities. According to the NAACP, these factors led to the issue of a travel warning.
“People’s rights are being violated.
They are stopped on the basis of their skin colour and abused or killed,” Missouri NAACP chairman Rod Chapel told Kansas City Star.
“We have never heard of so many incidents in such a short time.”
The Missouri Travel Bulletin is the organization’s first warning for the US state.
The organization cited examples of racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black student from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year. He was driving through the state when his car was running out of fuel. Missouri police arrested him despite not being charged with the crime.
According to the Missouri Department of Justice, police are 75 percent more likely to arrest a black driver than a white driver.
“The purpose of the travel notice is to urge people to be vigilant and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel says.
“People need to be prepared, for example, by bringing money to pay guarantees or telling relatives that they intend to travel through the state.”
According to the FBI, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, the sixteenth highest in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri’s new law that makes it harder for companies to sue for discrimination in residence and employment.
The ACLU organization, which defends civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had passed immigration laws that require police to arrest people for immigration violations.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the State Department, and apply to other states. Recently, however, NGOs have issued them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for an explanation on the CEO's supplementary pension
Industry Minister Mika Lintilä (central) has asked Finnair for an explanation of the additional pension payment received by the airline’s CEO Pekka Vauramo.
This, according to the minister, is in conflict with the state’s declaration of will.
Vauramo’s additional pension of €130,000 came to light this week when Helsinki Sanomat about the remuneration developments for the directors of stock exchange companies.
Finland’s Kuvalehti on Vauramo’s additional pension in February.
Finnair has announced that it will quit supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has stated that additional pensions are not used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year’s principle decision on ownership management.
Sanctions immediately tightened.
Until recently, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on the way from cold to warm.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met at the G20 summit in Hamburg, seemed to get along well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions passed by the U.S. Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday reacted sharply in Russia.
Earlier, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called Trump’s sanctions “a full-scale trade war.”
Even if the Russian reactions could only be attributed to sharpening and exaggerating political rhetoric, the tightening of U.S.-Russia relations is a fact after a short honeymoon after Trump’s election.
The U.S. sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea were not easy.
Although Congress passed the law with considerable unanimity, it was much more difficult for the president to pass the law.
Trump criticized the newly signed bill as “significantly flawed.”
Russia may have been the cause of President Trump’s resentment, although the adoption of a law that restricts its own powers must have been disgusting.
As is well known, an investigation is being conducted in the U.S. regarding both Russia’s possible interference in the presidential election and Trump’s campaign’s ties to Russia.
The tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
As the staff of the White House has shifted tightly and various scandalous turns have been revealed to be almost updated, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the leadership of the president, but despite the president.
This situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship between Russia and the United States is a kimurant, the same applies to the European Union.
Not only the economic sanctions, but also the tense security situation in the EU’s core region in the Baltic Sea are tightening relations.
The EU has highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements.
Although the EU has so far remained unified in its policy against Russia, at least on top of it, the interests of the member states are quite different.
For a member country like Finland that has a lot of trade with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real scandal.
The consequences of the new U.S. sanctions are still unclear.
There are concerns in the EU that the sanctions will hinder the operations of many European companies.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
The acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of liquid natural gas (LNG), which is important for the US economy, from sanctions.
Trade sanctions are a means in world politics to show outrage.
However, economic sanctions need to be well thought out and careful.
Otherwise, they are easily more harmful than beneficial.
Is nothing holy anymore?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty
The absence of statues is the most sure sign of a change in power.
Americans know it as well as others: Iraqis, along with American soldiers, struck down Saddam Hussein’s statue on Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologists of the Trump administration, knew well what he was doing in a fierce debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a word-black reference to the president's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller did not criticize the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge flocks of cruise organizers and figures imitating the Statue of Liberty.
He was attacked by the significance of the statue and in particular by the fact that in 1903 a poem by Emma Lazarus was added to the statue’s foundation – 17 years after the statue was completed.
Miller said, “I don’t want to go into history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was added later and does not belong to the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller himself was not wrong, but it is not just history, as he himself said.
Lazarus said, “Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses longing to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.”
Poetry is now more relevant than ever.
Miller made it clear that “the poorest of the poor” are not welcome in Trump’s United States.
The dispute over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a wider political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
The friends of Lazarus campaigned after his death for the poem to be attached to the statue. They knew well that the act was strongly political.
The statue was intended to express the connections of French and American republicanism in a classical symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the expelled.
Incorporating the poem into the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh – a whistleblower who can now be seen as some sort of a predictor of Trump – argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not show up to anyone to invite, but is the early pioneer of the neo-Conservatives who will take the U.S. to a world covered by darkness: “Lady Liberty stands out.
He takes freedom to float from the United States to the rest of the world.
It does not show the way to the United States.”
Rarely, Limbaugh was partially right.
The significance of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the perspective.
Lazarus saw it like the poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants on board the ship after a long and trivial journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people seeking protection and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts by giving hope and welcoming.
That’s what Miller and Trump don’t want.
Their whirlwinds do not show the way, but spark the flames of anger, their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish national team members of Britain
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots entered the UK national team
Neil Black, the result manager of the UK Sports Federation, said the 16 Scottish members of the national team that will participate in the World Cup were “a significant reinforcement.”
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Cup, which begins in London on Friday.
Black said there is "something special going on" in Scotland, from which British sports must learn.
“This is welcome, and we will continue to investigate it as long as we understand what it is about,” Black says.
“I spoke with the representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sports, and they thought it was related to the institute’s activities.
The Scottish Federation of Athletics believes that it is related to the activities of the Federation.
And the British Federation of Athletics believes that behind it is their activity.
And the ordinary street driver thinks he must have something to do with it.
It’s a great thing, no matter what it is.”
Many Scottish athletes are seriously competing for medals in London, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000-meter race.
“Eilidh is too modest.
His captain’s speech was incredibly amazing,” Black says.
“The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and highly motivated no matter where they live and practice.
In Eilidh’s words there was a genuine feeling and passion for sport.”
Eilidh Doyle is the silver medal winner of the Commonwealth Championship in the 400-meter race, and this is his fifth World Championship.
The previous record was seven in 1983 and 2015.
Laura Muir has run five British and two European records in the course of a year.
He will compete in 1500 meters and 5000 meters in London.
Chris O’Hare runs 1,500 meters in London. He is also worth keeping an eye on: he has a great season behind him, including wins in the British World Carnival and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first world championship, when the only Scot was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is “enormously proud” that there are so many Scots involved, some of whom are seriously competing for final seats and medals.
“It’s a great honor to be captain, but it’s even more special because the members of the national team voted for the captain,” Doyle said.
“I am very proud of all the Scots who got to the national team.
It shows how far we have gone.
They are involved as well-deserved athletes who compete for prize places.
The Captain’s Speech?
I think it went well.
I was focused on how lucky we are when we have housekeepers.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere is going to be awesome.”
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don’t Be Candidated for a Public Position If You Can’t Stand Up to Criticism
Our father knew what bad publicity is.
Americans loved George Washington, but newspapers soon began to criticize him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism is annoying.
But he did not silence his critics.
“If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led stupid and silent like sheep to be slaughtered,” Washington said in 1783.
This leads to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their performers.
The U.S. Civil Rights Union filed a lawsuit against Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge unfounded, and the attitude was depreciating even online.
“It’s just Facebook,” a lot of people say.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an astonishingly popular Republican governor in a Democratically ruled state.
He has received the second best rating among 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to heat.
He has ruled the state steadily and has strictly adhered to principles.
She has also skillfully used Facebook as the main channel of contact with her voters and posted a photo of her chelated head under chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking users from entering the Governor’s Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor’s page is a public and official forumined by his staff on tax funds.
Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions in an interview with the Washington Post.
Stamping commentators as trolls, spammers, or haters, however, is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed users who were blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their chosen leaders. They were not trolls but, for example, teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors.
They said that their comments were respectful, attentive and relevant.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comment; he wanted to invoke Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Maryland's Bowie was not hostile but raised a question about hate crimes.
“I politely comment on being disappointed that Hogan has not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news,” he wrote in a Washington Post comment.
“I also can’t accept that when several people comment on the same thing, they’re immediately seen as somehow an organized crowd and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens.”
The governor’s staff called the comments a “focused attack”. somebody else could call them to promote matters considered important.
In the era of Facebook, it’s easy to control communication by blocking a critic or removing a critical comment.
In the past, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical headlines, or to arrest and silence protesters.
This is the same thing, but only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of blocking Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision on the subject was made last week in Virginia.
Alexandria District Court Judge James C. Cacheris said the Loudoun County government violated the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution by blocking voters from accessing Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Union went on a discussion with Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This should not be difficult.
At the time of Washington, cheap postal fees had a similar effect as the Internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers mourned Washington.
There were trolls at the time.
The pseudonyms Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers in which they haunted Washington’s decisions.
The President’s office was flooded with petitions criticizing the Jay Agreement, the U.S.-British Cooperation, Trade and Shipping Agreement.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of discussion are the foundations of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped.
Samples have come from about half a dozen locations, and also online announcements from a couple, three.
Most of them have come from southern and actual Finland, but then also from Haapavedele and Seinäjoki, says specialist researcher Marja Isomursu from Evira.
They died of a parasitic disease called trichomoniasis.
It is caused by a species called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit pigeons, and especially the frogs.
In the 21st century, however, the disease also began to be detected in birds.
In 2009 it was very cool.
At that time, the trichomoniasis caused a large collapse in the Finnish caterpillar plant, after which the species' stocks have been recovering.
There have now been sick spiders, but not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, museum master at the Helsinki University’s Natural Sciences Central Museum (Luomus).
It is fearful that the previous epidemic will reoccur if nothing is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing everyone can do: stop feeding birds in the summer immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home-field advantage at Renaissance Club
Former Europe’s top player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from a home advantage for the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman Rafferty led the tournament last year at the neighboring Archerfield Links before the final round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty has the new place and serves as the tournament's ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
“I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will come to its full glory,” says Rafferty.
“The players see the field at their best, it’s in great condition.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He is an avid ambassador of the game, and he is proud of his achievements here.
The tournament is a great showcase for this field.”
The Englishman Eales defends the championship for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
“It feels like a really special opportunity,” says a player living in Southport.
“I was unable to defend my win at the Extremadura Open because the tournament is not part of this year’s tour.
It is great to come back.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year’s memories come back to mind: Winning the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a wonderful time that we will always remember.”
Gary Orr returns to real action on his own ground, and he joined the tour after turning 50 years old earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“Playing at home is always more meaningful than usual,” says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
“You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I playing again and played very well.
I’m happy with my game so far.”
The trio will be followed by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament includes six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Parking costs £5 if there is only a driver and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Eventual internal air problems were investigated.
In Säkylä, at least so far, no internal air problems have been found in the building of the Por brigade messaging company, the brigade on Thursday.
Inland surveys are continuing.
The investigations began when the man who suspended his warrior service for health reasons thought his health had deteriorated due to the poor indoor air in the camp.
Colonel Mika Holman, Chief of Staff of the Por brigade, said there were no health problems with the other soldiers.
It turned out that this was an isolated case and that no other employees in the unit had any health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this matter thoroughly.
At the moment, it is not known that we would have any internal air problems, Holma says.
In a statement, the brigade said that due to the arrival of the July batch, the goods had to be moved to the garrisons, so the dust may have increased for a moment.
The air may have seemed so dull, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia
Bardina Degei does not use heat in cooking.
He also rarely uses it.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Panai region, located in the unrestful Papua province of Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the potato – locally “nota” – directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the potato burned on the straw is eaten greedy naked, with unwashed hands.
Degey’s home has no furniture.He sits on a muddy floor, where he also usually does his daily tasks, such as washing clothes in the muddy water drawn from a nearby pit.
The toilet service is delivered by a bucket in a roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of her four wives and is not assigned to take care of the fields.
Multilateralism is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot.
“No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening,” says Degei.
This is a rare glimpse of everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony annexed to Indonesia in 1969.The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying troops.
A local independence movement opposed to the Dutch government quickly turned its anger on the government of Jakarta, which holds the region under strict control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is a remote and hollow place. The journey there begins with an hour and a half flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and continues with a twisting five-hour ride in a rental car.
There is no public transportation here.
In the city of about 19,000 inhabitants, there are wooden houses surrounded by bamboo roofs, whose wave roofs have become coloured.
Only a few Indonesians have visited here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago tribes worshipped the god Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
“We didn’t have that kind of clothes,” says Degei. she means a colorful, hand-woven cloth head, a dark shirt and a bright shirt.
“In the past, we only had leaves covering our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28 percent of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, with child mortality and illiteracy among the highest in Asia.
But it is also the gold land of Indonesia.
Paniai is a hill region about the size of New Jersey, with 153,000 inhabitants. Just about a hundred kilometers from Pania is Grasberg, the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine. It is owned by Freeport McMoran Company, headquartered in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papu has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, as they mean the suppressive presence of the strong Indonesian army.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid local military personnel and local military units $20 million between 1998 and 2004.
Papua’s demands for greater sovereignty threaten this source of income and are silenced mercilessly.
Human rights activists say the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 Papuan since 1969 and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the massacres in the Papua tribal highlands in the 1970s grew to the extent of genocide.
Last year, more than 3,900 people were arrested in peaceful protests in the region.
The 2016 report of the Archdiocese of Brisbane, We Will Lose Everything, contains reports of last year’s atrocities, including executions without trial, torture – rape and electro-attacks are popular – and ruthless attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s difficult to count the number of victims because there are incidents every week,” says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The rush has been tightened as Papua’s natural resources are attracting migrants from the rest of Indonesia.
Of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants, 83 percent are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing as Indonesian Muslims from the populated islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes migrate to the region in the hope of better livelihoods.
Java warung diners sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable mixture in peanut sauce.
It is difficult to compete with locals.
“Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables on the marketplace for cheaper prices than the locals,” says Abeth You, a 24-year-old from Pania who moved to the province’s capital for work.
“The local women lost their clients.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo – nicknamed Jokowi – pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address Papua’s injustice and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 districts, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 districts, including Pania, on his trip to Jakarta’s presidential castle.
But little has changed in Papu, and locals feel deceived.
“Our hearts broke when we voted for Jokow in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice,” You says.
The Panias experienced some sort of wave-base just two months after Jokow’s October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs at the fireplace in Enarotal on December 7, 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers came out of the dark on a motorcycle.
The children, frightened, told the soldiers that they should wear lights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said drunk soldiers caught the children and abused them with rifles.
One of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of abuse.
A few hours later, the building of the State Electoral Commission, located near the scene, was set on fire, and the next day it began to happen.
Around a thousand Papuan — young men, women and children — gathered on a football field in front of a local police station and a military command center to demand justice.
They carried hunting braces for celebrations, and began performing the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, where they danced in the ring and imitated bird singing.
Demonstrators stoned police and military buildings.
As the atmosphere heated, the soldiers were ordered in the internal radio system: “If the human troops resist more than three times, shoot them to death.”
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the resident leader of the Kego Koto area, guessed the situation was getting out of hand and urged the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
“When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist,” he told TIME magazine on the veranda of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn’t know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
“A number of shots were fired.”
Alfius Youwia was shot three times.
“I ran to him and made sure it was really him,” Yohanes told TIME with sadness.
“I saw that she was dead...I kissed her.”
Papuan police inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that the police were simply “protecting” the police station because it was the target of the attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for Papuan police, said in 2015.
It is a matter of life and death.”
Human Rights Watch said five young protesters were killed and many wounded.
The news of the deaths reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered an emotional speech in Jayapur, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
“I want the case to be investigated immediately so that nothing like this will ever happen again.”
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the legal system.
He immediately canceled his speech.
“Most of the violations occurred long ago,
in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but that requires certain processes,” he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind.
“Everything will be settled in court,” he said.
The United Nations accuses Wiranto of “crimes against humanity”.The crimes are linked to the deaths of more than a thousand people in the bloody independence referendum in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Pania.
The families of the victims react to the allegations with disbelief.
“I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way,” says Yohanes.
“I’m tired of this already.”
He says he still lives in fear, despite years since the incident.
“I am afraid,” he says.
“I am afraid that the army will arrest me, I am afraid that I will be shot.”
His brother Yacobus confirms that the panicals do not dare to discuss the incident.
He said the soldiers had abused him when he helped to bury four of the victims.
“Soldiers are looking for me in their hands after the victims are buried,” he says.
The shootings are not over.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighboring area of Pania, in Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the construction company’s manager, which began when the manager refused to take the unconscious man to the hospital.
The man who needed hospital treatment was Ravianus Douw, 24, who had fallen into the water while fishing on a nearby river.
Angry villagers demonstrated on the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to police, villagers stoned police officers, who responded with warning shots.
According to local authorities, however, a mobile police unit of the Indonesian semi-military police opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
“We are in horror.We are afraid of revenge,” says Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and saw when the wounded were brought to treatment.
“I’ve been hiding at home for two days.”
Deiyai’s parliament has called for the police to be held accountable for the shootings and the withdrawal of a mobile police unit from the area.
Panya has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development fuels dissatisfaction among the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes, who live in the lush middle basins of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuan people through random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of OPM’s leaders are Pani, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the uprising by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of “protecting national sovereignty.”
Some of the detainees will never return.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as “the sad, forgotten place.”
Poverty creates dissatisfaction.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotal, and it is too expensive for locals, too.
Like the bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is a female job, and one female can be responsible for four or five potato fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold on the marketplace.
Ten pomegranates cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the differences in livelihoods between locals and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes to Nabire Airport were opened.
There are few jobs, and they tend to go to better-educated and wealthier migrants than local.
Only a few people have enough capital and knowledge to run their own business competitively.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village because there’s no work or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Panai tribal council.
The remote Papua has little attention in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news communications remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua despite being granted a rare photography license. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy head of Asia at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises.
“Reporters from Indonesia’s troubled eastern provinces of Papu and West Papu are facing new risks: refusal of visas and blacklisting,” Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is only being pressured by Papua’s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua’s “numerous and widespread violations”, including the Panai shooting.
These countries have traditionally also supported the liberation movement of Papua.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that “Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations.”
They want foreign governments to intervene.
When a Dutch official delegation led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar visited Jayapura on May 4, 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, an anonymous source said.
Indonesia is holding presidential elections in 2019, but the Papuan people say they are no longer likely to vote for Jokow.
“Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who have been involved in the Pani shooting,” said Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the panicals: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in poverty and poverty, practically without health care and educational opportunities.
According to Gobain, the Panians, like other Papuan people, consider the votes they gave Jokow to be a “debt” to be paid back.
“They don’t want money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Panai shooting attack once again showed symbolic resistance: they buried one of the victims on the opposite side of the police station and the military headquarters.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they won’t let those responsible forget their crimes.
“My family member was killed,” Yacobus says in his head.
“What else could we do?”
Dereck Chisora Cries About Robert Helenius' Canceling: "Even My Fans Don't Want to See"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to play at the Hartwall Arena on May 27.
The match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent IFL TV interview, Chisora reveals the reason for floping the match completely on Helenius’ shoulders.
My match in Finland flopped, but it wasn’t my fault.
I don’t live in Finland, I don’t want to sell tickets there.
This is because of my Finnish opponent.
Even her fans don’t want to see her fight because she’s miserable.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in the Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
Ticket sales for the new match went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match was postponed to autumn.
There was nothing new about the match.
However, the cancellation no longer annoys Chisora.
The match would have been cancelled due to Chisora’s illness.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up with severe pain.
My head was about to explode.
I was told in the hospital that I had to be cut, Chisora says.
The British says they are at about 45 percent.
He is not interested in a new match with Helenius, but is aimed at Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a defeat against Whytelle in December.
Fire hits Torch skyscraper in Dubai
On Friday, fires struck the world’s tallest residential building in Dubai, where hundreds of residents had to escape from a 337 meter high 79-storey building.
This was the second fire in two years in a building that happens to be named Torch, the torch.
The building was evacuated and no one is known to have been injured.The cause of the fire was not known immediately after the incident.
“We were asleep and woke up to the sound of the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes,” a resident named George told Reuters.
Rescue officials in Dubai said the fire was extinguished at 4 a.m. local time and left to cool the building.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case may again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer roofs of high buildings around the world.
After the 2015 fire, the board of directors of the Torch building conducted a study, which found that the panels used to cover and insulate the facade suffered the most damage.
In the UK, police believe the insulating and covering plates at the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid progression of flames in the fire that killed 80 people in June.
A car was stolen from a car park during the night.
A motorcycle was stolen from a parking lot in Riverside between 21 a.m. on Tuesday and 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.

In the United States, more than 20 percent of airline passengers carry banned items on board, a survey reveals
A survey of air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of passengers in the U.S. had consciously or unconsciously carried out prohibited items onto planes past U.S. Traffic Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least six percent of passengers had knives or other objects with a blade that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent said they had only later learned that they had accidentally carried weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey was conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, a charter airline with more than 1,000 passengers, and the results also revealed that younger passengers are more likely to bypass the rules than others.
Of the passengers who deliberately violated TSA rules, 19.7 percent were members of Generation Y and less than 15 percent were members of Generation X.
The most common violation of the rules was by bringing food and liquids onto the plane.
More than three percent admitted that they consciously carried objects with blades onto the plane. Additionally, 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men that they consciously carried banned drugs onto the plane.
The company, which conducted the survey, wanted to find out how many passengers had accidentally passed the security check and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that most travellers are also most likely to take the smuggled goods through the security check – consciously or unconsciously.
But as the survey company notes, TSA’s guidelines are quite complicated and confusing.
Passengers often don’t know what fluids are allowed to take on a plane and how much.
It is therefore not surprising that the majority of TSA seizures are liquids.
For some time, there was also the belief that books should not be taken onto the plane.
They are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruitt reiterated his decision to delay Obama’s decision to cut emissions
A day after 15 states filed a lawsuit against Scott Pruitt, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Pruitt revoked his previous decision to delay the implementation of Obama’s decision to reduce smoke emissions.
According to Pruitt, the change demonstrates that the agency he has headed takes better account of the needs of environmental decision-makers in the states than in previous administrations.
Pruitt did not mention a word of an appeal against his previous decision before the Federal Court of Appeals.
The states are expected to meet the ozon level requirements for 2015 from 1.10.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions by one year so that his agency would have more time to get acquainted with the plan because the agency “does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth.”
Pruitt was the Attorney General of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as head of the EPA.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industries.
The sudden change of mind on Wednesday is the latest setback to Pruitt’s plan to mitigate regulations.
Last month, the Washington-based Federal Court of Appeals ruled that the EPA director exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration’s decision on oil and gas companies.
In a statement on Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his full translation of ozone regulations would only strengthen EPA’s cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements on time.
“During previous governments, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to challenge it in court to reach an agreement on timetables,” Pruitt said.
“We don’t believe in judicial regulation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the regulation concerning our activities and its powers to us seriously.”
However, the EPA’s opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to use “his powers to delay the execution of decisions and other legal powers” to ensure that the provisions “are justified and based on the best available information”.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wider change in ozone regulations.
The bill, adopted last month, aims to delay the implementation of 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The bill has not yet been voted in the Senate.
New York State Attorney-General Eric Schneiderman, who led the EPA lawsuit this week, said the group would continue to press.
“The EPA’s change of mind as a result of our lawsuits is a significant win for those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smoke in their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit involved California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Ozone is generated when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
This form of smoke can cause severe breathing difficulties for sensitized groups and is also a part of the cause of thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists rejoiced over Pruitt’s surprising change in direction.
“It’s worrying how much pressure was needed for the guy in charge of our air to use common sense,” says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biodiversity.
“We still have to fight the Trump administration, because its ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interesting groups.”
Supercar manufacturer to become a street car - "it happens in the style of Ferrari"
It will also invest in hybrid sports cars while striving to retain its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari’s style,” CEO Sergio Marchionne said of the plans at a press conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year as the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News.
All cases of measles in Eastern Savona of the same type of virus
The measles infection is the same type of virus as the previous cases in Eastern Savon, THL reports.
The Virology Laboratory of the Department of Health and Welfare confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in Eastern Savon is the same virus strain as previous infections.
THL has confirmed that the case of measles infection confirmed on Friday, July 28 in a person on the shore has the same type of virus as the previous cases in Eastern Savon.
Based on this information, all the infections found in Eastern Savona are related to the first measles in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not discovered any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that after the fifth infected person, new infections may appear until mid-August, and the epidemic is therefore not yet over, says Dr. Mirkaleena Erkkilä, who is responsible for infectious diseases at Soster’s primary healthcare.
No new measles infections or suspicions have been since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the timeliness of their own vaccination protection, Erkkilä reminds.
More on the subject: Three new measles infections confirmed in Pirkanmaa - "Additional infections or epidemics very unlikely"
Finland is preparing for a licensed quilt
Pontica soup was not even considered to be legalized.
Based on the basis that the process produces wine alongside methanol, which is toxic.
Making shell at home will be legal next year, but the legalization of pontica soup is not even being considered.
The shell is made by fermentation, the pontic again by distillation.
The reason behind the regulation of the distillation is that the process produces, along with wine, methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will for the establishment of the Pontic soup as a right of every man, the government council Ismo Tuominen of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the Alcohol Act, the Pontica distillation was not considered to be legalized.
Nor was it put on the political table.
There was no discussion about the liberation of Tislawa, says MP Outi Mäkelä.
He is part of the negotiating group of parliamentary groups of the government parties, which took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Law.
A permit for the distribution of pontica at home can not be granted even on application.
Commercial production is also subject to license.
There is a simple rule in the making of alcoholic beverages at home: alcohol can be prepared at home by fermentation.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally make a whiskey at home.
The government wants to simplify the rules.
The new law eliminates requirements for flavour and flavour materials and allows for the manufacture of shells, Mäkelä specifies.
The preparation must still take place in such a way that the raw materials or the flavourings and flavourings produced in the process of fermentation are clearly visible in the beverage.
According to the new law, you can make as many drinks as you want, and you can give your own alcohol as a gift.
It should not be put on sale.
It is no longer a public health problem in Finland.
A much larger change occurred in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were liberalized.
75% of the alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be considered by the parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The meeting is 5.9.
The law will come into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the parliament had already taken a position, the Mäkele is pleased.
Oscar Pistorius was taken to hospital by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius has been taken to a South African hospital for heart attacks.
Pistorius has been released from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is sentenced to prison in Atteridgeville.
According to the Mirror newspaper, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain but was released from the hospital in the afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to hospital for examination.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family said the former top athlete is well.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced the six-time paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Lettered Telephone Talks Reveal Trump Pressures Mexico to Build Border Wall
Telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders have leaked to the Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on January 27, 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop his public speeches saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The U.S. president said he had publicly shattered the wall, saying “You can’t say that to the press,” Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a letter about Trump’s first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would accept refugees on its way to Australia was “laughable”, “grim” and “stupid”.
Trump ended the call by saying to Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant call of the day.”
Georgian massacre: Activists reshaped racist lynching in hopes of justice
A Ford Mercury car passes the crowd in the rural town of Monroe in Georgia and continues its journey towards the small Moore’s Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car. Four armed men block the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the gang, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and walks through the windscreen.
The passengers are scared.
“Roger, n – u!” the man just cried out.
“Come out of the car!”
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a resurrection, which was presented on 22 July 2017.
The shock of shock, however, is genuine when the hanging veil is wrapped in “Roger’s” neck.
Since 2005, human rights groups have returned to Moore’s Ford Bridge to re-establish the events of 1946, when the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with murder.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested over these years – even though the murderers live among us and many have to know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helps arrange the resurrection.
“It is the shame of history, but above all it is a burden that weighs on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and a former Georgian congressman.
For him, the resurrection is a striking call to action. It also reminds the inhabitants of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
“We want the culprits to be brought to justice.We want things to be finally done, and we want to recover from sorrow and make a reconciliation, but above all we want justice,” Brooks says.
“We cannot recover and make reconciliation until we get justice.”
A death investigator covers the body of a victim of the massacre in Georgia on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI documents received by NBC news reports, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
No one was accused of murder.
Even though the culprits have been released for decades, activists say the motives for the lynching have always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, black people in the state of Georgia were allowed to vote for the first time in the presidential election by the decision of the Supreme Court.
According to the FBI, there was an incident during the election, in which a black landlord, Roger Malcom, stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight that apparently concerned Malcom’s wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, there were rumors in the city that Hester had had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting this child.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, an influential white landowner, paid Malcom $600 in bail, for which he was released from prison.
On their way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their cars in front of Moore’s Ford Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and arranged the murders," the FBI said in a statement.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities. authorities were involved in the murder and destroyed evidence and did not disclose the identities of the witnesses.”
Brooks expresses this in a more concise way.
“It was a voting crime,” he said.
“They were murdered because they wanted to tell black people that they would do the same if they were going to vote.”
Cassandra Greene has been directing the revival of the massacre in Georgia for almost a decade.
The show is extremely realistic and captivating.It is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe in the already lost United States of today.
It’s hard to watch the show, but even harder not to see what Green intends to do.
“We don’t want to talk about lynching because we’d have to face our own dark side,” the director says.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t listen to me or don’t want to hear what I’ve had to experience.”
On the first day, about 30 actors — a dozen blacks and a dozen whites — gathered to listen to Green’s routine summary of the show.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene’s assistant director.
He has been playing the local leader of the Ku Klux Klan in the revival for years, but the role is always as difficult and disgusting.
“I feel dirty because I’m not myself,” says Marbaugh.
“It is important to keep this side of history out, so that it never repeats itself.”
On the other side of the room, they will be trained by Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, namely Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom cries and cheats on Hester. She is angry that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothy.
“Did you not hear me?” he said, “I told you to leave my house.”
Rascona or Hester responds.
Then comes the blow.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughed the most.
“What?” asked Rascona.
He is confused.
“Have I accidentally hit too hard?” he asks.
“No,” Greene cried out.
“I just don’t think white people used the word n---u at that time.”
“Yes,” another black actor confirms.
“It’s a slang. You need to use a longer version.”
The subject of the show is unpleasant, but the room is dominated by the spirit of friendship.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not just for the sake of the performance.
The scene starts from the beginning.
The words of Rasputin are blurred.
No one laughs.
The resurrection ends quickly and violently.
Shots, shootings and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral suit stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's song Strange Fruit.
His voice is broken with every second word.
A few ten meters away, fifty spectators wiped sweat and tears from their eyes.
Nearly half of the population is black and half white.
Among them is a couple who came to watch the show from Ithaca, New York, but most are local.
They have, under Brooks’ guidance, visited the tombs of the victims in the pressing humidity of Georgia.
Murders have changed from story to reality. The atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song performance, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The children stumble to look at artificial blood and unmoving bodies and whisper to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” the little boy mumbled as if to remind himself.
Within a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors took off their coats and wiped away their tears.
Bradshaw plays Marbaugh, a man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona returns to two actors and then breaks into tears after a tough performance.
“No problem,” the woman in the show comforts.
“We know you’re not him.
You did this for a good reason.”
Later, the audience and the actors gathered for a dinner.
A white couple from Altana is talking lively about the show with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it hard to find words when she describes the feelings that the performance arouses.
“It’s hard to listen to awful words and watch awful acts being said and done by people who look like you – just because they look like you,” she says.
“My show made me realize that lynchings are still happening,” he added, “they are just called arrests.”
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for audiences sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning for next year.
“Renewal is a powerful experience because it depicts the horrors we’ve experienced, but it’s also an educational experience,” Brooks says.
“The message is that this can happen again if we don’t learn from it.
“Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it.”
Hanging vegetables in stores shocks: Removing this amount of “excess parts” really saves
Is it permissible to remove the leaves of the cabbage already in the store before weighing?
Take off a big hat from an ananas – how much does it weigh?
The answers strongly divide the opinions: for some it is a sign of extreme spending, while others do not want to pay for the portions of vegetables that they do not use and that still go home to rubbish.
This phenomenon can be seen in the shops.
For example, in the vegetable department of the K-Citymarket in Helsinki Ruoholahti, you can find cardboard boxes, because many people rip off, for example, the leaf pieces of cabbage.
From the box, the leaves are exported to the bio-waste market.
According to the news published by the Economic Speakers, the snoring of vegetable dishes is surprising for merchants.
But how much removing the extra portions of vegetables before weighing really saves you money?
How important is the genuine measurement?
We Women tested how the price changes when the leaves or strains of ananas, latva-artisoca, delicate mushrooms, broccoli and flower cabbage are taken away.
Flower cabbage: The price of a flower cabbage costing 2.10 euros was 1.80 euros when all the leaves were cut off.
Ananas: The price of an entire pineapple costing 2.30 euros dropped to 1.95 euros when its stock dropped.
Latva artisoke: the price of 2.60 euros became 2.40 euros when the short stake was cut off.
Taste: Two taste grapes cost 75 cents in total.
The price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: A medium-sized broccoli cost 1 euro and without a stake 80 cents.
End result: If leaves and stems are kicked off, one vegetable can save a few dozen centimeters at best.
In terms of percentage, the price of vegetables dropped by up to 20 percent.
Thus, we would have saved a total of €1.20 on these purchases!
Neymar has signed a five-year contract with PSG.
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was that Neymar's representatives had paid 222 million euros to FC Barcelona, who plays in the Spanish league.
The €222 million transfer is the largest in the history of football.
The previous record was held by Manchester United, which last summer paid €105 million from Frenchman Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league stopped the move earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar’s first payment attempt.
According to the rules of the league, the club that buys cannot pay the withdrawal price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his or her contract, which is done by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He is likely to be introduced to a new home audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA is investigating details.
Barcelona also said in a statement that it will provide information about the payment to the European Football Federation (UEFA) in order to determine any disciplinary action that may arise from the case.
Spanish Premier League Chairman Javier Tebas has accused PSG of breaking the rules of fair play.
The UEFA can penalize any club that loses more than €30 million over a three-year period.
According to UEFA, Neymar’s transfer does not automatically break his financial loop.
Neymar’s transfer to PSG will affect the club’s economy for several years, but the impact can’t be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG could sell several players for substantial amounts, UEFA.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former professional tennis player Nasser al-Khelaifi.

Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from lightning attack - flash was captured on airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing the usual work on a plane at South Florida International Airport with a couple of colleagues when a lightning suddenly struck the plane from a rainy sky.
The lightning force threw the aircraft into the ground near the wing of Dunn.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and told me that his brother had an electric shock and he is in the hospital.
I just asked if he was alive," Austin's sister Autumn said.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to burns, he had muscle injuries and cerebral bleeding.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
You cannot wait for that.
It’s traumatizing for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and the transport business itself decides whether to comply with it.

The British training group Pearson announced on Friday that it will cut 3,000 jobs and dividend by 72% when launching a new restructuring program in response to pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, the job cuts will mainly take place at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019.
Pearson announced it will cut spending by £300 million again in May as part of its third savings plan to revive weakened by rapid digitalization.

Attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military facility in the Afghan capital, Kabul, according to authorities, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others.
NATO said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the attack in Kabul’s Qarabagh district.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month.Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bombing at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night the explosion occurred after a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol was attacked by a “human-carried self-propelled explosive device.”
The statement said all the wounded were in a stable condition and were treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to correspondents, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide bombing in Kabul, a region predominantly populated by Shia Muslims.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bombing in central Kabul, the country's most devastating militant group attack since the U.S.-led forces overthrew the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump considers whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people’s confidence in the government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA rejects decision to postpone the implementation of smoking regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rolled out its decision to delay the implementation of Obama’s decision to reduce smoke emissions a day after 15 states filed a lawsuit against the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called 2015 “ozone determinations” late on Wednesday.
“We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states,” Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency’s intention to postpone the implementation of ozone determinations by one year until October 2018.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 mainly Democrat-controlled states, including the District of Columbia.
President Donald Trump’s administration has sought ways to mitigate the environmental regulations under Barack Obama, saying the measures are part of a broader programme aimed at economic growth.
Trump’s measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists, who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to the EPA website, breathing ozone-containing air “could impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a member of the Islamic State group was also sending parts of the bomb to Sydney.
The bomb was supposed to be carried to the plane on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before the security inspection.
Police do not specify why the operation was stopped.
Another plan by the suspected terrorists was to build a device that would emit toxic colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as public transportation.
Australian deputy federal commissioner Michael Phelan said the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four suspects were arrested on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation continues.
Renewable fuels: Renewable fuels do well
Oil refiner Neste’s earnings before taxes fell, but beat forecasts in the second quarter.
According to Chief Executive Officer Matti Lievosen, the company achieved good results in oil products, sales of renewable products rose to record levels and the business profit development in the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable business profits were improved by the U.S. Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievosen, the business profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and more favorable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and will complete the strategic investments we have already announced in 2017, Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatchenko discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatchenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future under 66.7 pounds series, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel in Los Angeles until WBC’s unbeaten lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked along the hallway to greet Lomatchenko, WBO’s upper feather champion.
Garcia defeated former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at the Showtime with a unanimous decision. Since then, Garcia and Lomatchenko have been among the top five on the list of boxers in different weight classes.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, “How are you, Master?
Good luck in the match!”
Lomatchenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday.
When the duo posed for photographers, Lomatchenko manager Egis Klimas noted that the men’s match would be “perfect in terms of sizes.”
“I’m a former penny man,” Garcia recalled.
“I moved to the top [63.5 pounds] for Broner, but I’m not that big.
I am small to 63.5 kilos.
I want to go back to lightweight.
He must rise to the lightweight range [61.2 kilograms]. Then we can beat.
That is what our fans want.
fulfill their wishes.”
Lomatchenko was in agreement.
“The team needs this match.”
Klimas asked if the match should be held on the pay channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomatchenko, according to which Lomatchenko will debut in the lightweight series later this year and will compete next summer against Garcia (37–0, 30 crash wins). Garcia would also be interested in facing the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will compete in the lightweight series at the Forum on September 23.
“The match could be on the pay channel because fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, later announcing that he was ready to compete on the channel that offers the best prize package.
“We are the most interesting names.
No one else gets as much attention.
“I’ll do it as soon as we get a deal.”
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as a “unbelievable player” and that he may be going to watch Saturday’s match.
Lomathchenko interrupted the praise of Garcia's wheel and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "truly slow.
Garcia said he focused first on showing the strike force and then on boxing.
The men said that they felt that the match between them was going to be increasingly stronger.
“This is the match we are waiting for.
No other game attracts as much attention and interest.
I’m definitely involved in this,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he expected to be able to compete against the best: "Mikey is a legend.
It will be a great match.”
Average salary of 5,300 euros, training what happens - investment advice situation was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been talking a lot lately.
Recently, the Helsinki Sanomat about Ritva, 68, to whom the investment advisor of the banking sector spoke a whole bunch of words when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisors and the sale of various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The measures are based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees who sell investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
There are no skills requirements defined in the law.
The Financial Industry (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service complete its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The Finance Industry has authorized the organization of the degrees to a firm called APV-placement exams Oy, whose examination work group consists of experts from the Financial Supervision (FIVA), universities and industry actors.
The exams range from 12 to 15 credits and are prepared by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides business management development services.
Its website says that generally speaking, both exams are “pretty broad in terms of requirements.”
The teaching material for the exams includes 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV-placement examinations Oy, says that the passing percentage of exams is roughly 70.
Approximately all of the employees of the largest banks who provide investment services have either completed an APV1 or an APV2 qualification, as it is mandatory according to the company’s own rules.
Then there are smaller banking, without mentioning names, whose staff appears to have avoided graduating, Savikko says.
According to him, there are “several” of these types of banks.
According to Saviko, 13,000 to 14,000 people have completed APV1 since 2000 and approximately 3,000 people have completed APV2 exam recommended for more demanding investment advisors.
Some banking companies consider completing a degree to be an advantage.
Many other industries have much stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the Financial Sector requires the completion of APV degrees, because then the knowledge related to the investment sector will be ensured.
On average, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros a month, including commissions, natural benefits and performance remuneration.
The average monthly salary of regular working hours is approximately EUR 5,300.
The average monthly earnings of men in these positions are approximately EUR 5,900 and of women more than EUR 4,500.
The top ten earners earn an average of approximately 8,100 euros.
One in ten men earns more than €9,000 a month or more, and one in ten women earns €6,400 or more.
Investment advice according to the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
So far, self-regulation has been trusted at the level of employees and duties.
According to Fiva, the audit it carried out encountered individual cases where the investment adviser’s professional skills and qualifications were insufficient on the basis of the adviser’s activities.
In principle, you can also act as a seller of investment products, even if your professional skills and qualifications are at a reasonable level.
At this point, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other sectors have much stricter skills requirements, Savikko notes.
From the beginning of next year, this will be tightened with the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
It requires each company to be responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services is sufficiently competent.
The financial supervision authority, on the other hand, has the power to determine what to know.
Marko Hovi, Fiva’s market supervisor, says that one of the clear changes to the current is the regulation on requirements for investment advisors and vendors of investment products’ knowledge and experience.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply both to the own staff of investment firms and to affiliated agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
According to the proposal of the Government issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Fiva will be empowered to determine knowledge and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided in the outlook in the coming autumn.
In the future, the company must also provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and further training.
All this must be documented, and the company has the duty to prove that this has also been done.
Hovi specifies that, in practice, the company must, for example, map the characteristics of the staff at the individual level.
There will be different levels of requirements for this, depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the court, it is also a new requirement to work with someone with more experience for a certain period if the knowledge or experience is not at an adequate level.
That is, if the company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work for a certain period of time with a person who meets the criteria.
As a result of the change, the rules will be tightened and more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.

The flight was scheduled over the US via Flightradar24.
The flight was carried out on Thursday by a 787 Dreamliner aircraft with which Boeing tested the durability of the aircraft's Rolls-Royce engines on long flights.
The aircraft, which departed from Seattle, flew a distance of 15,700 kilometers in 18 hours and 1 minute, which is longer than any regular commercial routing flight in the world.
The flight stayed within the United States borders.
It flew through 17 states.
Imatra's stubborn beach schoolchildren are not tempted by rain or sunshine - Iines Kaikkonen polski with the help of a swimming pool village
Everyone walked at a good pace, and the cries followed.
Imatra’s beach school rounds in Liette and Lempuka this and next week.
Even if it rains sometimes and then it shines again, the young swimmers are not the same, praises Taina Itkonen, the head of the swimming schools.
In Swimming Schools this week, a total of 13 children will increase swimming skills, next week there will be a dozen.
The number of children in the coming week was influenced by the fact that at that time the school and the square already started, estimates Itkonen.
The Imatra beach school is organized in cooperation by the Projekt Liikunta yhdistää and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, we had a nice swimming pool.
The sun was shining and the young swimming schoolchildren trained to stay on the surface with swimsuits, some already in the air.
The younger siblings also liked it.
At the end of the 5th century, I went deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to jump toward the beach.
It goes great!
He said he had been swimming a lot this summer.
The swimming pool is good for him.
Iines, like Kaikkonen, practiced swimming with a swimsuit, Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too will be pleased with today’s achievements, the swimmer praises.
Jami Kallio, 4 years old, once again wanted to go to the water tanks.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her 6-year-old daughter Anna Villberg swimming from the beach, considers the beach school a good start to learning swimming.
Although the weather has been what it hurts, Anna loves to go here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swimmers packed themselves in the pool.
The boys were struggling with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread their towels on the shelf, sprinkled fruit and baked for the day.
In the water, the lessons continued, but there was no rush on the shore.
Something that doesn’t belong to summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilets - "This is a kind of unifying story"
You see all sorts of it.
Blue Products, which manufactures cleaning products, launched a series of Unknown Soldier products a few days ago.
Thus, towels and laundry clothes - as well as "wc brush with edge brush".
The unknown soldier is referring to the film and marketing of the film that will premiere this autumn.
Still, there’s something special about the combination, and there’s a rush on the products on social media: When will the Unknown health links come out?
I have to call the company and ask what it is about.
What does the executive vice president say?
We are a film partner.
We are supporting this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, Määttä says.
According to him, there will be a special presentation of the products in the market, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn’t there something a little funny about this—often when you think that the products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, this is a kind of unifying story that we are a Finnish player and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports his same basic Finnish values, which are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not alien to military culture, Määttä points out.
Other business partners in the film Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall vichys have been imported to the market, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products have already been recorded by Finnish Kuvaleht's blogger Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and clocks are also available.
He said there is still time until the premiere of the film, so there is still time to continue.
Unknown partners have not yet revealed their military products, such as Valio, Jalostaja, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New results for asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest results of the medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been released. The results of tests conducted using the new assessment method reveal that more than 80 percent of those tested were determined to be over 18 years old.
The Swedish National Forensic Medicine Agency began testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Agency was criticized for failing to determine the actual age of applicants who claim to be minors.
The Immigration Agency has so far carried out 6,880 tests, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of 2,481 tests.
In 2002, 80 percent of the tested asylum seekers were determined to be over the age of 18. In addition, the Office of Forensic Medicine determined in 25 cases that the tested was “possibly 18 years old or older.”
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker was “possibly under the age of 18”.
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency says the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
“The figures are fairly consistent. There are no significant differences to the statistics of the previous months,” he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of the applicants were determined to be over the age of 18, it does not necessarily mean that the applicants would have lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and that in 442 cases there were “indications that the subject is 18 years old or older.”
When the Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he would be 18 this year.
In the medical age assessment method used in tests, X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of the knee joint are taken. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the suspects is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolin Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people. The assessment can be used to determine whether a person has reached puberty earlier or later.
“I have had reason to think about it, and I think the method used is not the right one.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t determine age with certainty, we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told Metro.
However, forensic agency Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of defining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test subject will soon be 18 years old.
Ilone crashed 30 places in Scotland
Five more than par results in the third round, Mikko Ilonen spent 30 points on a downward score slide in the European Tour of Golf competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left the 11th place on Saturday, but was found to divide the 41st place at the end of the round.
In a difficult battle, Ilos had a double-blog with three bogs.
Others were difficult.
Englishman Ian Poulter rose to share the top spot in a one under par round, even though he said there was enough work to do with the umbrella.
Keli was rough, but I hanged with it and eventually the day was good, Poulter inch.
He shares the top with his countrymen Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia Governor Changes Party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday that he is changing his party.
“The Democrats simply abandoned me,” Justice said.
“Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflection...Today I tell the West Virginiaans that I can no longer help you as the Democratic Governor.”
The public broke out in applause.
“Tomorrow as a registered member of the Republican Party,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time for a new game.”
Trump has promised to make a significant announcement at the West Virginia campaign.
Trump won West Virginia with 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, according to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owned coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth approximately $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement on Thursday night that “Governor Justice’s party change is yet another blow to a democratic party that prefers to build barriers than a better America.”
“The Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before.In this context, the announcement of Justice is the latest reversal to a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive message that unites people,” RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS news.
Lightning sown damage - Thursday is coming even to summer's most thunderstorm day
In the end of the week, there will also be more storms in southern Finland.
During the past week, it has been a storm especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, several fires were destroyed by lightning.
Meteorologists say Thursday may be the most intense day of the summer.
Finally, they also found Finland.
Over the past week there has been lightning especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
At the table, a lightning hit a rowhouse's power station, causing a small fire.
The fire was to the rescue service around midnight on Wednesday.
The power station was located in a sauna area in the outskirts of the rivital.
Rescue workers demolished the roof and walls to find firefighters and quickly extinguished the fire.
A total of 11 homes were left without electricity, but injuries were avoided.
At Loima again, lightning lit the exterior building in the airlights on Harjuloti before midnight.
When the rescue service arrived, the building was already in the full stage of the fire, and the rescue service could only prevent the spread of the fire.
A fifty-square-meter building burned to the ground.
In the direction of the painting, the lightning hit the home again.
Inhabitants of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flash of lightning.
The rescue service visited the scene to check the case, but this time the lightning did not cause a fire - only a few firefighters struck.
In traffic, a thunderstorm caused problems on the railway between Seinäjoen and Vaasa, when a lightning hit damaged the traffic control system.
The information was received between 8 and 9 a.m. on Thursday morning, after which trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was resolved just before 5 p.m.
Since then, train traffic has been able to continue normally along the railway section.
Lightning has sown destruction across Finland.
However, this summer has been relatively low.
This summer’s thunderstorms have been quite blatant! estimates meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, a journalist at the Meteorological Institute.
Wednesday and Thursday thunderstorms have been mostly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low lightning balance of the summer, many even feel strong.
This may sound like a very heavy thunderstorm, but that’s what it has been compared to this summer’s thunderstorms, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the countryside flooded 1,700 times, and on Thursday there has been a potential for even the hottest day of the summer: by about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 countryside flooded.
If lightning continues until early night, more than two thousand lightning can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The last record-weak lightning year was in 2015, when the annual lightning number was about 30,000.
As of Wednesday, this year’s lightning number had risen to 18,386.
It is important to note that this year does not break the record of two years ago.
However, the scandal can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the sunshine over Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a favorable birth environment for thunderstorms.
The main focus will be shifted from the northern parts of the country to the south on Saturday, where there can be about 2,000 lightning days both on Saturday and Sunday.
In the central part of the country there is a more unified seed line.
In such cases, it is said that they are merely sprinkled.
Coe praises Russia's apology for doping scandal
World athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia’s apology for the doping scandal on Thursday, but added that it was not yet time to end Russia’s ban.
Russian athletics leader Dmitry Shljahtin said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday that Russia’s ban was appropriate and that he intends to fight against doping with determination.
He said he regretted “in the name of all the athletes who were deprived of gold or silver medals in competitions.”
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of extending the ban.Russia was excluded from sports competitions in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) presented evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I think his response today was very straightforward.It was a very open presentation,” IAAF Chairman Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian Federation of Athletics admitted that the country has gone through difficult times and announced that it will do everything in its power to reorganize its activities.”
Coe said he was also “happy” that Russia accepted the terms of the ban.
“I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the Working Group’s recommendation that now is not the right time to end the ban on Russia,” Coe said.
“We need to do everything in the coming months to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes apart from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete for the status of neutral athletes at the World Sports Cup, which begins in London on Friday, and have met the IAAF’s strict criteria.
Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF working group, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
“Tests are still inadequate, and banned coaches continue to operate freely,” he told reporters on Friday at the IAAF Council after a performance in London.
Producer disappointed by Tom of Finland
Tom of Finland was not as successful as the authors hoped.
To be honest, I am disappointed, admits Helsinki Films CEO Annika Sucksdorff Yle in an interview.
I feared that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached roughly 100,000 viewers, which is in the film’s budget, about five million euros, compared to little.
No lottery winnings have come from this, but now it is important that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful at home, they would have already gotten their money.
Now we have to wait for a small stream of foreign distribution, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How Football Financial Rules Affect Neymar's Transfer to Paris
The regulations restricting the use of money by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain in France.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) is being sanctioned by the European football regulator UEFA, which may block teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA adopted the Fair Play Financial Rules, which require PSG to prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without significant losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros for the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary in the new club ranges in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a variety of economic aspects.
PSG has no trouble paying Neymar’s transfer fee and attaching him to its star card as the club funds Qatar’s oil-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend large amounts of money to acquire players, but they must be balanced with real sources of income so that the football-related business is not losing.
The Fair Play Economic Rules were formulated on the initiative of Michel Platini, who was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini believed that pursuing success with debt was a scam and would lead to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play financial rules shifted from clubs’ debt to their losses tracking.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model first used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003 was significantly complicated. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year review period of the Fair Play Financial Rules will last until 2018, during which time clubs will be allowed to make a maximum of €30 million in losses.
Although Platini was forced to resign as Uefa chairman in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, wants to curb the club’s careless use of money.
“The rules of the fair game are still in place, and we will continue to apply them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, UEFA’s financial regulator for fair play, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a lump sum, it can periodize the amount in the accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual expense of €44.4 million over the next five years.
The first penalties were imposed on PSG and Abu Dhabi-funded Manchester City in 2014.
PSG was fined €60 million, which was later reduced to €20 million.The club was also ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is monitoring clubs that may attempt to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their revenue through companies associated with the club’s owners.
For example, if a Qatar company supports PSG but the value of the subsidy is considered to be higher than the normal level in the market, UEFA will not count the subsidy as the actual profit.
In 2014, UEFA ruled that Qatar’s tourism authority was over-supporting PSG.
It has also been revealed that some of Neymar’s earnings at PSG could be financed by payments available from Qatar’s 2022 World Cup organising committee.
PSG and the arrangement committee, however, have denied that Neymar was being made an ambassador to the World Cup.
As a result of previous sanctions imposed by PSG, UEFA is closer than usual to monitor attempts to circumvent the rules.
Officials said on Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated Neymar's transfer with PSG.
The sources gave an interview with the Associated Press on the condition that their identities will not be disclosed because they do not have the authority to discuss the situation with PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG's turnover for the period 2015-2016 was EUR 542.4 million and operating profit exceeded EUR 10 million.
Last year’s financial statements have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of club products and game shirts.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 percent with Neymar’s contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the world’s best players, tried to hinder Neymar’s transfer, allegedly violating the economic rules of fair play.
“This is a clear case of economic doping for both the club and the state,” Spanish League President Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is also concerned about the state funding of the football club, which is owned by an American sports base.
“The case is the result of a possession that has completely changed the football environment over the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
It becomes very difficult to abide by the economic rules of fair play. There are so many interests associated with the fact that a famous player represents the state.”
Finland's World Cup coach arrested in Helsinki
Length jumping coach Arttu Pajulahden and coach Kristiina Mäkelä Suren Ghazaryan are stuck in Helsinki, even though he should train at the World Cup in London.
Christina may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Tomorrow we will be competing in the length jumping race and on Saturday we will be competing in the triple jumping race.
Armenian coach Ghazaryan has not been granted a visa to Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to handle the matter at the British embassy without success.
The coach has an invitation from the organizers of the World Cup as a document, but also has not been eligible for a visa.
Per this is one of the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, coach director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always handled visa matters himself successfully in the past, but now there are some problems.
He will do everything to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Sports Association SUL for years.
It does not have so much importance.
Whenever someone looks at the footprints in the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti told his coach about possible withdrawal.
World Cup in London calls for a miracle
The World Cup starts in London on Friday and lasts for a week and ends on Sunday, August 13.
General sports, skiing and ice hockey are the kinds of sports that Finnish bench athletes are able to be passionate about from year to year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of the athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other metrics.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one competition to another, where the acquisition of experience matures the athlete’s performance to the level that the adult World Cup medal is truly possible.
There are no such young athletes in the Finnish world championship, even if they are not small.
The World Cup requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the fascination and surprising thing about sport is that miracles can happen.
It pulls the bench athletes to the TV screen and stick to watch the competitions, even though the medals in London are only decided late in the evening because of the time difference.
In the previous 2015 World Cup, Finland won one bronze medal.
It was a long-running landscape.
The courageous people are expecting a medal from Pitkämäki now, although the results of his and other thieves in recent days and Pitkämäki’s loss in last summer’s competitions tell us something else.
Whatever happened in these competitions, Longkämäki will remain in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes in the competition, entering the final competition or setting their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medalist of Finnish general sports in the coming years will give good success in the international competitions for young people this summer as well.
Cultivating young talents and supporting them financially is more important thanining a small elite team of representative athletes.
Success does not come in an instant, it requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both the coach and the bench athletes.
The Finns know how to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully the London Games will be recorded as the race of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because of terrorist terrorism or brutal attacks.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper’s big air – “But sorry”
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has been ranked second in the big air competition in Colorado, USA.
The second place at Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi’s best big air world cup.
The winner was American Jamie Anderson.
He scored 147 points in the competition.
He tried the caballerial 1080 for the first time in the race, and it was very close to success.
It feels good and good now, but I’m sad that the last jump didn’t go well.
From now on, I’ll try again in this game.
In snowboarding big air, a competitor jumps from a jump made for the species.
Viking Line’s new speedboat crashes into port in Helsinki
Viking’s new speedboat FSTR is delayed.
The boat was scheduled to depart from Helsinki to Tallinn at 6 p.m.
The ship was loaded in eight countries.
The ship arrived late.
I waited for about an hour and a half to get on board.
Now the line is moving a little, said Johannes Rebane, an Estonian waiting for boarding at the port of Helsinki at 19.30.
Rebane believed that the new ship had a technical fault.
Rebane said the shipping company had brought water bottles to those waiting for access to the ship in their cars.
Viking’s communications chief Christa Grönlund told IS that there was a technical failure.
It was repaired at the Port of London.
The ship leaves Helsinki with a few hours of delay.
Grönlund says the ship will also be delayed a couple of hours from the return trip to Tallinn.
The ship had to depart from Tallinn back to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.

Little Circle Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story revolves around both the days of the characters’ glory in the 80s and the grunge of the 90s (at the time David Wain and Michael Showalter made the brilliant The State sketch series for MTV) and their own time in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved on to bigger stories.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the continuous remembrance that we have stuck in during the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have lived in its time.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (there was, among other things, the background story of H. Jon Benjamin speaking in the voice of a vegetable bar).
The essence of the joke is that middle-aged actors play lustful actors approaching adulthood. emphasizing it makes the impossibility of reaching the past part of a joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodizes, for example, stalkers’ films from the 1990s, such as the horror film The Hand Who Spots the Ripper.
At one point, one of the characters excavates an Apple Powerbook, inline rollers, and “A different joke from 1991.”
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has not yet overcome Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot involves Ronald Reagan (also known as Michael Showalter) as his criminal companion George H. W. Bush (played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are side trails.
It’s fun to see Paul Rudd, a young man with a shave patch under his lower lip, Matt Dillon’s “soul patch” from Singles.
Moments of random madness may take this series to fly as a sort of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later.
Amazon’s Comrade Detective series appeals to a different nostalgia: The Americans’ spirit of the Cold War, Atomic Blonde, and even GLOW’s thriller where the East meets the West.
The comedy series is created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and directed by Rhys Thomas. It is a Romanian police drama from the 1980s in which a Bucharest-born couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
In the main roles of the hard-to-do Gregor and idealist Iosef are Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici. Their alterations have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (main producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It is a great idea,
But there is not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (polices spend time watching chess on TV in the same way that Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective is too stuck to imitating the ugly socialist drama – including a killer hiding behind a Reagan mask, for example.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough or abundant enough.
In summary, the series might work better as an agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby chewing on hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary communist public is that Western culture can turn everything into consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not mistaken: we have stunned our own recent history and their history as well.
Toni Tauru will face former UFC player in Macau on Saturday.
Toni Tauru wants to keep the game up.
Toni Tauru is facing a tough bone in Macau, as the Brazilian Leandro Issa played in the UFC last year.
He also holds the black belt and the world championship.
I am fighting against the elderly.
It’s a funny story, the 32-year-old Tauru says.
Kouvolan had to rise to the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three fights were quickly scheduled for the Chinese Autonomous Region of Macau.
Taurus has never encountered anything like this before.
This was the first time my match was cancelled.
It was annoying, because preparation and training took a lot of time.
However, the team is pleased that a new match has taken place.
A week of waiting has little to do with preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition, as it does not improve in a week.
Your condition can get worse if you exercise too much.
In a few previous battles, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths are in vertical wrestling.
This time the situation is different.
He is described as a typical Brazilian.
He is a pretty aggressive player.
I bet he’ll get up in the first half and try to get on the carpet.
He has won the world championship in jujutsu, so he knows how to beat.
The last match did not go as planned.
Philippine Kevin Belingon hit the Taurus in the eye, and the victory was left to the Philippines.
I’ve never played so well, especially when he didn’t get a hit.
When I walked out, he hit my eye.
It bothered for a long time.
New motivation
Some of the freelancers compete once a year, some rise to the circle more frequently.
For example, the future opponent Issa last played in September.
Last year there were three matches.
This is the second battle this year.
Sometimes I get pregnant.
I’ve been training for years and I’ve been in good shape all the time.
But I’m just playing because of the game.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in training and got the pleasure back.
We had a really good training when there was a guy from Sweden.
The exercise was a great help, because on Saturday the kouvolalainen must prepare for a physical struggle.
I have been able to train against the same size opponents and to practice vertical play.
This is the main tactic of the 32-year-old.
You have to strike reasonably.
If I get the opportunity, I will go to the park myself.
You should not give them for free, because they are the ones that consume the most.
Macao attracts the former Taurua in China.
This is Las Vegas in China.
I think we have a great and beautiful evening ahead.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged as economic growth has been relentless and the slowdown in inflation has put an end to speculation about interest rate increases.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to slow.The bank postponed interest rate increases because of increased pressure on families’ income levels.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s monetary policy committee voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank lowered its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 percent and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6 percent.
However, the bank said interest rates would need to be raised in the coming years to curb Brexit-induced inflation.In addition, the bank announced that borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, members of the committee decided to cancel part of the massive economic package that began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to offer £15 million more, or a total of £115 million, in favourable financing to banks through the scheme.
The minutes of the Bank’s interest rate decision state: “The Monetary Policy Committee forecasts that the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years, as the decline in real income of households reduces consumption.”
In terms of interest rates, the bank reiterated the need for a “some degree of tightening of monetary policy” “a little wider” than market expectations to curb inflation.
The market currently predicts the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that the possible increases are “gradual” and “limited”.
In May, the bank forecasted growth of 1.9% this year and 1.7% next year.
Now it hasined its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8 percent.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound decreased by 0.5% to 1.31 USD. Compared to the euro, it decreased by 0.4% to 1.11 EUR.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after weaker growth figures than expected suppressed increased expectations of interest rate increases.GDP grew by 0.3 percent in the second quarter and 0.2 percent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to boost slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation report gave little hope to households suffering from accelerating inflation and low wage increases.
The Bank added that monetary policy “cannot prevent” a decline in revenue in the coming years, however, it expects wage growth to recover “significantly” at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong increase in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound.
The decision came a year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25 percent following a shocking EU referendum that dropped the pound.
The bank estimates that the overall effects of the decision are likely to begin to appear in prices and in the economy only in four years.
Prior to the central bank’s latest decision, demand for interest rate increases had increased as inflation increased the pressure on households.
Inflation declined last month to 2.6% from 2.9% in June, but according to the bank it was expected and inflation will tighten again in the coming months.
The bank said that the excess of its 2% target was "totally" due to the weak pound.
“Given the recent decline in swap interest rates, the competition in the mortgage market appears to be tightening even more as lenders fervently seek customers and want to end the year strongly,” said Andrew Montlake, chief executive officer of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
“The market looks good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Renewal agreements are becoming more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also non-consuming options available.”
NHS orders 10,000 controversial HIV medicines
Starting in September, patients can be prescribed a “reversible” anti-HIV drug. The Supreme Court settled a dispute over the financing of the drug in the English Public Health System (NHS).
The NHS that Pre-Exposure Prevention (PrEP) was prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. The drug taken before intercourse has been found to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86 percent in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court’s ruling last year. According to it, the NHS is able to pay for the PrEP medication, even though it claims that local authorities should fund it.
NHS Director Simon Stevens called the announced decision “a major new intervention” and the national AIDS organization described it as “a crucial moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to receive registrations for the experiment, which will expand to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is a HIV medication taken before intercourse that reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection rates in risk groups.
A medication taken before intercourse means that there is enough medication in the body during intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The target group of treatment includes gay, bisexual and transgender men, as well as people with HIV-positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
The clinics select qualified candidates from men, women and transgender persons, as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to be receiving antiretroviral therapy for their disease.
People living in England who have enrolled for general medical care can also apply for the trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs £10 million, and the NHS of England signed a drug procurement contract this week following an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of a PrEP drug by collecting extensive clinical evidence on its targeting, taking, and implementation of treatment.
“This significant new intervention should complement and enhance existing, diverse and increasingly effective ways to prevent HIV,” said Stevens.
“This is another significant achievement in the more than 30 years of struggle to solve one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
“This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,” said Deborah Gold, director of the national AIDS organization.
“If PrEP medication is targeted correctly to those in need and those at risk, it could have a reversing effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, those at risk will be given a medication through an NHS-funded trial that they can decide on on their own without having to consult with a partner.
This was a welcome news.”
“The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and no one in the risk group is left out of it,” said Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
“The experimental PrEP drug has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people at risk from HIV infection.”
“The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that lasted in vain for several months due to the government’s slowdown,” said Sharon Hodgson, the shadow government’s health minister.
“We have evidence that the drug may have a reversing effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that the experiment starts as soon as possible across the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and take another step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society.”
Quality of life: the middle floor and smart interior solutions have made the small Earl’s Court apartment a spacious home
Former banking enthusiast Joanne Leigh moved from the Knightsbridge residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl’s Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a house in the style of the Queen Anna era. The success of the renovation is indicated by the fact that Joanne has not packed her clothes yet and moved.
“Before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment,” says Joanne.
“I’m looking for something similar in my price range.
I went here in the apartment display and found that the rooms were as high as in my then apartment.
I liked it immediately and made an offer the same day.”
Since then, the apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a double room, with access to the bedroom only from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor to take advantage of the room height.
“I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
That was my demand,” he said.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed design office in Notting Hill. Erfan was commissioned to take advantage of the space of almost four meters high rooms and create an apartment that would not only be a repair and sales destination but a home.
The height of the room was not enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where it could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
“The steel structures are quite complex.
The premises had to be arranged overlapping so that they did not need to be crawled.
The structures had to be modified so that the height is exactly suitable both on top and below them.”
Erfan was able to overlap two full-height rooms with fascinating details.
On the middle floor, Retrouvio’s copper-crossed window opens into the elegant living room.
The mirror-gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage lights create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatrality, a sense of space and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than it really is.
The mirror in the kitchen space is like a window that opens a view into another room.
The mirrored furniture of the entrance has storage space for Joanne’s dining and glass items.
This makes the kitchen hidden when it is not used.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution,
But what is unique about Joanne’s kitchen is that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
“It took a little design,” Erfan says of the steel-enforced MDF door.
“It’s balanced, which means it slips very easily when raised.”
With reasonable space use and storage space planning, Joanne got 16 additional square meters, a second bedroom and an even better ground solution.
“When selling an apartment, the area decides – or the value of the property,” Erfan says.
“In the basic case, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area.”
In Joanne's apartment, the area was added by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
“The resident is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotional connection with the apartment is partly based on them,” Erfan says.
“No one is attached to the electrical wires that run through the walls.
They are important, but not the same.”
Joanne’s apartment is an example of how good design and additional elements can make a basic home exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.

He grows us with sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, a pub appeared in Lahti Square where Thai food was sold.
The men did not dare to eat, but walked by.
At home, food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among acquaintances Panja.
He knew very little Finnish, and the Finns did not know Thai at the time.
Because the people did not dare to go out to eat, Panja offered free snacks.
So he taught the Lahtians to eat Thai food, spring turtle at a time.
of the country, he said.
I was caught in the valley.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened his Thai food store in the Lahti Trade Hall.
There were two small tables and there were less than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to the vent guest.
When you are hungry and there are limited places, you can’t leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
We gradually became better acquainted and became friends.
Finally, I sat on a plate with a dictionary and learned Thai.
Two years went on the side of the shop hall, but then the restaurant had to move because the spices made by themselves said they smelled too much in the hall.
At the end of the trade hall, a new place was released.
There is space.
Now we jurors are allowed to sit at our own tables again, only in the most crowded times we are forced to question the guests if there is room next to them.
The company knows its customers.
He told me where he was and who he was seen.
Everyone knows what they eat.
He has seen how the life phases of customers vary and the food company changes.
She remembers the name of the man with whom I went out to eat my first spring crocodile.
He remembers me thin and fat, and remembers how I was when I was young.
It’s nice to go to lunch a little later than others, to sit in my own place next to the kitchen door and exchange things with Panja, who’s relying on a dish.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
She has taught tolerance and internationalism with a sweet chili sauce.
He has also opened our tastes and our minds and our hearts.
Today, many people speak to him in Thai - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire the Panda.
Even though he has had a hard time, he is always kind.
He is hardworking.
At the restaurant, he goes in mushroom and black.
Last week, the restaurant celebrated two decades of effort.
Our customers gave us a dessert cake.
Without alarm or attention, this significant day went by, at work.
Discovery of underground base reveals 173 ISIS terrorists prepared to attack Europe
At the beginning of the year, the security authorities received a list of important anti-terrorism efforts.
The list contains data of more than 170 ISIS fighters prepared to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 individuals and the document contains not only their personal data, but also photos of each.
More than 130 of the people on the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
I told you about the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information contained therein have been clarified.
According to the newspaper, special forces of the Iraqi army found a list containing personal data and photos of terrorists while investigating the terrorist organization’s underground base in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence agencies assessed the authenticity of the documents and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The background was fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after the defeat of ISIS in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list contains not only the names and pictures of all people, but also their birth dates, invented alias, and information about the person’s home country.
The list also lists specific areas of terrorism.
For example, in the case of the 27-year-old German Sami J. on the list, the fighting name is Abu Assid al-Almani, or German.
He is said to have left Germany in 2012 to travel first to Egypt, then to Libya and later through Turkey to Syria to join ISIS.
Next to her picture is written a suicide bomber.
There is no more detailed information about the man’s fate.
A total of about 6,000 Islamic State fighters have fled from Europe to the ranks of the Islamic State, whose fate is uncertain.

He was handed over to primary care.
Estlander said it was a 50-year-old man.
On the basis of the interviews, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Togo is over.
Estlander thanked the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
This was the mission of the Border Guard.
The locals also handled the submarines well.

Brothers fight for over $500 million in real estate
The two brothers argue over a $500 million real estate empire, one of Victoria’s largest.The dispute relates to a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Colin De Lutis, former president of the Carlton Football Club and real estate developer, lives in Toorak, just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has brought to the Supreme Court a dispute over the division of real estate and business property between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the divorce.
Together, the brothers and their mother Anna own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began to accumulate wealth when they bought a store on Collingwood’s Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centers.
According to the agreement with the family’s deceased father, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company’s assets and Paul owns about one-third of the company’s assets.
According to court documents, the asset-sharing ratio means that Colin owns properties worth approximately $316 million and Paul about $176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of property and money.
“I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal,” Paul wrote in his first oath at the court in 2015.
The case was dealt with in the Supreme Court last Friday for the first time after several attempts at mediation.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business.Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
According to Colin, the claim is not true. he accuses Paul of poor management of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first oath testimony that he would like to find a solution to the matter.
“In accordance with our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing for me,” Colin said in a statement.
There are hundreds of pages of vowing statements, emails and reports. The case is investigating consulting firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer as well as the country’s best and most experienced lawyers such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded dairy bars and delicacies in the late 1950s.
They were used as collateral when the family bought the property from Collingwood, where Colin established the family’s first jeans shop.
Colin says he founded the store “in the last years of high school, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).”
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to move the property to their sons in a comfortable manner.
“Luigi often said he didn’t want the brothers to go to court,” Anna wrote in a statement.
The family’s other two sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group business. Colin said Mark earned $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Paul said Luke and Mark are “bitter about their departure from financial conditions.”
Colin hasined a low profile despite being a former board member of the Australian Football League and best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to this 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded.He said in his text message that he could not comment correctly on the matter because it is being dealt with in court.
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me in court and draw our family’s name into a legal battle,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept his brother’s claims.
“Our father didn’t want us to argue like this,” Colin continued, saying he still hoped that a solution would be reached.
On Friday, hope seemed to be gone.
“Our cases will be settled in court in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of personnel plans to restrict the president’s media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
The first .
According to the Poltico newspaper, the new White House chief of staff is planning to limit President Trump’s media use and news surveillance so that his boss doesn’t get into trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
“When the new White House HR chief John F. Kelly met with senior executives on his first day of work, he addressed a key problem he intended to solve: he intended to restrict President Donald Trump’s access to information.
Kelly told White House employees that all information, whether printed or heard at press conferences, must pass through him because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information.”
Kelly’s words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump’s media use and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television – and as president he still watches a lot of television.
“If presidential candidate Trump was upset by unfair news, it was worth showing him that sympathetic media treated matters more equally,” Sam Nunberg, a Trump campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico’s reporter Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that, “According to six former campaign workers, it is essential for Trump to control his use of Twitter that his personal media stream includes a steady stream of praise.”
clearly .
But it’s ridiculous to argue that Trump’s use of Twitter would never have been under control.
Per these campaign workers know something that we others don’t know – maybe Trump’s tweets would have been even worse without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump left unsend.
If his staff has even a few times managed to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently stop Trump from causing a riot.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who try to drive their cause by giving Trump information that supports their view.
In May, Politico wrote that counselors were deliberately giving the president questionable information.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher told about one case:
“Trump’s current and former employees say he may be enormously angry at press clips that criticize him – especially if they report harmful data leaks.
That’s what happened at the end of February, when someone blasphemously gave the president a copy of the news on GotNews.com, a website founded by provocator Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Human Resources Katie Walsh of multiple White House data leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and had previously spread false accusations and withdrawn them later.
Nevertheless, after reading the story, Trump had begun to ask staff about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that then-Chief Human Resources Officer Reince Priebus and White House Secretary of Human Resources Rob Porter “had tried to put in place a system of management of documents going to Trump.”
And what was the result?
Kelly will try the same three months later.
Maybe he turns out to be a more powerful leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants continue to drive their own affairs.
These unchanging facts make Kelly’s task very difficult.
Neymar signs five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was that Neymar's representatives had paid 222 million euros to FC Barcelona, who plays in the Spanish league.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona had thus been terminated and he was free to move to the Paris club PSG.
The €222 million transfer is the largest in the history of football.
The previous record was held by Manchester United, which last summer paid €105 million from Frenchman Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former professional tennis player Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Successful writer Raija Oranen dealt with alcoholism and airplay with hypnosis: "I am in good shape in my life"
Raija Oranen, a well-known writer of the TV series The Time of the Rose and Clean White Linen, just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped me.
Five grandchildren love their grandmothers so much in addition to writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki abandoned the Spanish sun and the Fuengirola apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring they also left the rental apartment.
In the light and sun, away from the old circles, Raijan was once carried by depression and alcoholism, which he has survived.
The exterior is 20 kilograms lighter.
The weight started falling when the serotonin medications were discontinued, they were mood medications.
I was helped with alcoholism by hypnosis, which also caused the fear of flying, I overcame it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years.
Alcohol takes a person, the radiant author says openly.
Raia and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same road for more than 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, who has also worked in the tourism industry, has been working together for over 40 years.
I woke up, and it was going to get married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
Such a queen of drama she has always been, ending her life with that, Jyrki laughs at her wife.
Oranen has made a vast career as a writer and remembers only the 44-part television series Clean white linenat, which touched and moved Finland during the time of paralysis.
I finally decided that the industry of Raikka family company was the clothing industry when I read Liisa Seppälä’s 50th anniversary interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of a seeker myself, my mother also had a clothing store and I sometimes acted as a mannequin, Oranen remembers.
According to him, the plot and story of the series changed the Finnish attitude towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen’s research and dissertation revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives an active time as a writer, she has many scripts under work - hundreds of ideas.
Tourists returned across the river to the “millionaires’ hole”
The wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again in battle with the stubborn circles who managed to cross the river needed by the municipality and return to the fields adjacent to the houses.
Tourists parked a couple of cars near a street called the Millionaires’ Hall in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but managed to cross the town hall tomb, which the municipality wanted to hinder. They brought with them children, horses and an army of vans.
Travellers managed to cross the obstacle at a point that had been left unprotected due to the path.
Angry residents have accused the municipality of Solihull of “complete inability to solve the problem.”
A resident who remained anonymous said visitors arrived on Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had stoned passers.
“The community must struggle to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The tourists were here in May, then they left but came back again.
There were more of them tonight, and probably even more today.”
The resident said the Birmingham municipality had solved the problem by prohibiting access to the parks.
“I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it’s frustrating to pay municipal taxes when the municipality can’t do anything about it.”
According to another resident who remained anonymous, it is ridiculous that the tourists returned so soon after they were driven away.
“There are more of them than ever before, and they have even dropped a horse into the park.”
According to a spokesman for the municipality of Solihull, the municipality is aware of the illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. „We are taking the necessary legal action with the police in Solihull to evacuate the campers as soon as possible.
In order to collect evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any disturbing or criminal activity to the police.
It helps to shape a comprehensive picture of the situation for judicial proceedings.”
Angry people surrounded Portuguese aircraft
In Portugal, the men who forcibly landed on a crowded beach have been questioned in court today.
As a result, two people died yesterday.
Two men who flew the plane could be charged with death.
In Portugal, he could be sentenced to 16 years in prison.
The plane had to make a forced landing on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the incident, some of whom ran a landing plane to escape into the water.
The plane crashed into a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl, who died immediately.
The plane first hit the man who was on the back of the plane.
Immediately thereafter, the plane rose up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, Filipe Janeira, who was on the beach, told the newspaper Jornal de Noticias.
The young girl was on the beach with her parents.
The girl’s parents were not injured.
Those on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started chasing it, Celia Rocha, a witness to the incident, told Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It is a wonder that no more people died.
The two men on board were not injured in the crash.
The Finnish star who lost his leg tragically won the World Cup gold again: "Without the accident, I't be a world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated early Wednesday morning Finnish time World Gold in banked slalom at the competition held at Big White in Canada.
He also won the Cross World Gold in the previous competitions.
In total, three titles have already been won.
An incredible MMO!
Twice treated gold, with a pretty good heartbeat pulled, reached by telephone Great-Hamari rejoiced.
The 30-year-old thanked his coach for his successful preparation.
According to Grand-Hamar, the number of challengers in the species is constantly increasing.
The entire parabolic board has grown and developed a lot lately.
The differences are decreasing, and there are a lot of new counters.
I wonder if there is a black horse.
Every match has a different winner.
He lost his leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been enthusiastically down with his friends since his youth, and the accident did not take away the desire to get to the slope.
Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like without that.
But my attitude has always been that it is useless to joke.
The cards are played on the ones that are shared, emphasizes the Grand-Hamari.
It would be cruel to titulate a serious accident and loss of a limb as a lucky blow, and Grand-Hamari does not.
But he turned the difficulty to his advantage.
I would say that the situation turned to victory.
I’t be a world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Suur-Hamar’s biggest plate was already fading.
The road to the top did not start until after the accident.
When I was young, I trained with my friends, and we were always excited about the X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimmed with time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow there at the start of X-Games.
I could not have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and thought this would be a very long life if I stayed here to grieve and grieve.
I decided to pull my clothes and start working.
I would say I have done pretty well.
He was very pleased to have chosen the wheelchair player Leo-Pekka Tähti as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner won his prize at the sports gala held in January.
According to Hamar, this victory is an important signal to the paratroopers.
It was a big win and it was definitely deserved.
This will also open our eyes to the world of sports.
When is the time to launch the double world champion Matti Suur-Hamar’s Athlete of the Year campaign?
We will see it in time.
I try my best to succeed.
The Great Hamari has not yet conquered all of the heights he has craved.
I have a big goal next year.
The Paralympic Games will be held in South Korea.
We’re going to get the medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not want to return to their homeland.
The end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS from the country are the most important things that should happen in order for them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration does not see any change in the Syrian conflict.
Communications agency chain Burson-Marsteller investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international survey.
Burson-Marsteller has been investigating the opinions and attitudes of Arab youths for nine years.
This year’s A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey looked at the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youths aged 18-24 responded to the survey, half of whom were women and half men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
More than half of Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland in the future.
42% of respondents could think they would return to their home country and 4% could not say.
According to the study, the decision of young people to return home is most influenced by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor for a permanent return home, while a quarter think the most important factor would be the departure of ISIS from the country.
Less than one-tenth say the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria are the main factors influencing the decision.
Military action alone does not solve the conflict.
The Syrian youth was asked what is the most important factor in ending the conflict.
The majority are of the opinion that an end to the war is more essential than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter of Americans consider Assad’s presidency to be an obstacle to a peace deal.
Nearly half believe that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria.
Only a quarter believe in solving the conflict by means of military action alone.
A majority of Syrian refugee youths see ISIS weakening over the past year, while a fifth see it strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is that the media communicate to the people that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Nearly equally many put military measures and education reform as primary measures.
More than one-tenth say it is important to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump administration on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four Americans believe the conflict in Syria will worsen during Trump’s presidency.
Opinions are divided as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the web in order – the database he developed is used by Wikipedia and Google.
Spanish company MariaDB is developing the “world’s fastest growing” open source database.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by code entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs users nothing, and can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge amounts of data are kept in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use LinkedIn, Twitter or Booking.com, they use MariaDB or MySQL databases.
“All information that is not in the image format comes from the database and the images are linked to it,” explains Widenius.
Widenius, the technology chief at MariaDB, spends about half of his time coding.
A man who works with beautiful hands remotely contributes to ensuring that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world’s most popular open source database, MySQL, together with Swedish scientist David Axmark.
In 2008, Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later, Oracle overtook Sun for $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade took place, a large proportion of MySQL developers announced that they were leaving.
“They didn’t want to work for Oracle, which didn’t give a sure promise about the future of MySQL,” Widenius recalls.
He had already founded a company that started developing MariaDB.
He did not want his life to die.
I hired two dozen of the best developers from Sun to ensure that the continuity of the code was secured by the same people who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
The name had to be changed.
A foundation was established to monitor the freedom of code development of MariaDB.
“These checks were not made during MySQL,” Widenius regrets.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL’s billion-dollar trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
“Our growth rate has been around 50% per year in recent years,” said Kenneth Paqvalén, chief financial officer at MariaDB.
Growth-focused MariaDB is not making a profit yet, and Paqvalén is a shortword on the company’s key figures.
According to him, MariaDB expects to receive orders worth 20 million euros in the current financial year.
Because the database is free, the company has developed services around it for which business customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB also helps with the exchange of databases, which can be over a year of work if the client has used a closed database.
The transition from MySQL to MariaDB is successful in an instant because they are versions of each other.
Telefónica and DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia, are MariaDB’s paying customers.
Most popular cloud services such as Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, Alibaba’s Cloud offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in Linux distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small company, we have connections with the biggest players.
“Our customers include the world’s largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks,” Paqvale lists.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is a modest by-business compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
According to research firm Gartner, the largest database companies have lost their market share in recent years, but in terms of turnover, players like MariaDB are still small, though fast-growing.
In a $50 billion database market, open source databases don’t even sustain a billion.
However, the weight of open source software can’t be measured only in money, as most users don’t pay anything for these software.
Gartner predicts that by 2018, will develop more than 70 percent of their internal applications on open databases.
Moreover, more than half of the old databases would at that time have been replaced with open databases or the transition would at least have begun.
Large companies don’t get new customers because most choose open source next.
This has led to the fact that license fees for commercial databases have jumped into the cloud.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers,” Widenius thinks.
Due to the difficulty of changing a closed database, most customer companies have obediently swallowed the price increases.
“There are a lot of customers for whom migration is really difficult because their old apps and others are stuck in a closed database,” Widenius says.
He still believes that the customer’s size is coming to its full.
As license fees rise every year, the customer sooner or later moves to an open source database.
The price is 10-20 percent of the previous one, and the service is better, because the customer can easily switch to another database if desired.
In addition, many companies are still facing major system changes as they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many change the database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a €25 million loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has approximately 115 employees worldwide and plans to hire more.
One reason for EIB funding was MariaDB’s impact on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros each year for databases.
“Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax money more effectively,” says Paqvalén.
Wideniusta is upset about how money is wasted in Finland, for example, on closed healthcare systems, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of a single software company.
Some say that open source is an ideology, but I think it’s a better way to make code.
The community helps and does something that it does not invent or can do.
Widenius, 55, is one of the most famous promoters of open source, along with Linus Torvalds, a Finnish Linux developer.
Widenius helps other companies develop working business models based on open source.
I still hold 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this topic.
Italy to strengthen its approach to NGO rescue vessels
Italy has warned NGOs that rescue refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to operate unless they commit to comply with the new rules.
“If NGOs don’t commit to the new guidelines, it’s hard to see how they can continue to work,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Torinese newspaper La Stampa.
Minnit’s warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship of the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, whose crew is suspected of cooperating with human smugglers, which promoted illegal immigration.
The charity, which has been operating for only a year, declined to comment on the detailed charges against Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosi.
“To us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing.We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area,” the organization said in a statement posted on social media.
“We can only assess the charges when we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa vessel since October.
The crew is suspected of taking refugees directly from human smugglers on board the ship, who re-used the boats.
One such case is alleged to have occurred just a few kilometers from the Libyan coast, according to a prosecutor’s document published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of threatening the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area.
According to the instructions, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who oversees the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the guidance: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
He said on Thursday that he considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable as they would not cause “significant changes or obstacles” to the organization’s rescue activities.
Among those who refused to comply with the guidelines is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti, on the other hand, noted that the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations has dropped sharply in recent weeks, which he considers to be a sign that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to yield results.
“In recent days, there has been a light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He revealed that he plans to continue discussions this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
A seasonal worker is suspected of killing his partner in Enontekiö, the suspect was found in the terrain - story to the prosecutor
The alleged murder took place in December last year.
Police say a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish partner.
It was previously that both were seasonal workers.
Police said the suspect had fled to the ground with two dogs.
The man was found frozen in the ground and did not resist when captured.
The indictment should be filed in less than a week.
The case may be brought before the District Court in August.
Robert Hardy, famous for Harry Potter and My Friends, has died.
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor’s death was announced by his family on Thursday.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the theatre at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also played in movies and television.
Hardy is remembered for his role as Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and his role as a veterinarian in the television series My All-Hairy Friends based on James Herriot's book.
The BBC series was filmed in seven episodes.
Michelle Carter sentenced to prison for sending suicide messages
A woman in Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls allegedly instigating her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, will spend 15 months in prison and five years on condition.
Carter was convicted of killing his boyfriend Conrad Roy on July 13, 2014.
“My family is broken,” Conrad’s father said at a hearing on Thursday.
“My son was my best friend.”
Carter filed an appeal against the judgment and was allowed to wait for the application to be examined in prison.
He was threatened with 20 years in prison, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream-coloured sweater, listened to his condemnation's hands on the cross with a crying look to the ground.
“His actions killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
“He decided on Conrad’s life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the crime,” the prosecutor continued.
“He has not shown regret.”
Carter’s lawyer said the incident was due to “shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz held that Carter’s “age or maturity level, or even mental health problems, had no significant impact on his deed.”
The prosecutor read a statement from Conrad’s mother, Lynn Roy, in which she said, “It won’t take a day for me not to mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I’m going through all this.I’ll try my best to comfort his sister in this pain we’ll always bear.”
Conrad’s sister, Roy Camdy, told the court that she was “persecuted” by the idea that she would never see her brother’s wedding or be a aunt to his children.
“It’s painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since I was born.
The case appears to be a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that considers incitement to suicide a crime.
Carter was 17 when he was found dead in a car in 2014.
The incident attracted national attention when it emerged that Carter had in his text messages encouraged his boyfriend to commit suicide.
“Hang yourself, jump off the roof, knife yourself. I don’t know, there are many ways,” Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks before his death.
Just before Roy’s suicide, Carter wrote: “You have to do it, Conrad” and “You just have to turn on the generator, and you’re free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention with Roy's death. The judge ordered that Carter should not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case divided the opinions of experts.
Only a few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox’s opinion paper stating, “Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison.”
NATO Secretary-General: Russia's worst relationship since Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated significantly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek closer cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
According to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in a political dialogue with Russia to avoid an exacerbation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s comments, U.S. President Donald Trump was able to say that relations between the U.S. and Russia had dropped to a dangerously poor level.
Trump also expressed his gratitude to Congress for approving new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi changes 850,000 diesel engines due to car manufacturers
A day before the announcement, BMW offered to update the software of more than 350,000 cars.
The CEO of BMW said the company believes that “there are more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities, including BMW’s hometown Munich, which are considering limiting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke of a recall.
European automakers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet their CO2 emission targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are thought to cause cancer and asthma.
Installation costs of emission-neutral equipment are rising, making it difficult to afford competitive prices for cars.
German automakers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of complicity and ignorance by major automakers.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s mistakes. Volkswagen installed scam devices in cars that reduced emissions to compliance with regulations in tests.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian citizen, so he may be extradited to the United States for possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation against Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars to circumvent European emission standards.
Audi's investigation could significantly undermine Volkswagen's position: the luxury car manufacturer's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionately high.
Venezuelan poll launched, mass protests planned
According to the company, the number of voters by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million more than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the election outcome, National Election Commission Chairman Tibisay Lucenan told reporters.
Maduro says the crisis is over
In a controversial vote on Sunday, the Venezuelan parliament voted to amend the country’s constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticized the vote and organized protests against changing it.
Maduro's opposition has postponed its own demonstrations so that they are ongoing at the time of the appointment.
According to the El Pais newspaper, the country’s national security forces began taking over the parliament building on Wednesday evening.
The troops are intended to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence
Lavender has become a symbol of the southern French Provence region, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender was reduced due to drought and disease-carrying insects. Scientists and farmers are desperately trying to find a solution to the problem.
“Lavendelle is directly threatened in the Provence region because it has suffered the effects of climate change in recent years. This has led to a significant reduction in rainfall in spring and especially in autumn,” says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Research Institute for Agriculture in Provence.
This reduces the life span of lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought many small cascades to the region that spread microbacteria.”
The bets are tough.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and is also a highly sought-after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
“Instead of long spots and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or completely missing,” Chaisse says.
“In other words, there are fewer components that contain essential oils.”
The solution is sought by enhancing irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying plants with a protective blend of clay and water.
The murder of a journalist demonstrates growing threat in Mexico
The editor of the Riodoce newspaper, which appears once a week, usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the newspaper deals with the latest cases related to organized crime, corrupt authorities, and the endless drug war in Sinaloa state.
Today, however, we are discussing security due to the recent tragedy.
Journalists are encouraged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists are discussing which one is safer: to leave the children at home or take them to a delivery that was hit by a grenade in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the board in the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group. No evidence is needed, observations and sensations are enough.
On the tablets are written the names of those drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected of being on government or drug cartel payrolls. They are criminals who make Mexico's chaos news life-threatening.
According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists under federal protection who have been attacked and threatened.
The latest victims include Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, editor and source of inspiration for Riodoc.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the building in Rio de Janeiro is covered by a huge picture where Valdez looks like a middle finger. The picture reads: “Justice”. Thirty-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts decorated with Valdez’s smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a branded panama jacket.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez’s death. Journalists will discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and fears of paranoia.
In 2010, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office was established specifically to deal with journalist cases, but according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, so far only two charges have been brought.
Journalists murderers are rarely brought to justice, and among the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime every year, only a few end up being brought to justice.
Riodocen journalists plan to continue to write about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are broken by grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
Ibarra said the security meeting would be of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope for justice.
“This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time,” he says.
“We can’t trust anyone until we know the cause of the incident.”
Valdez had left Riodocen’s office in the state capital of Culiacan on the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had driven a red Toyota just a couple of blocks away when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The number is presumably related to the magazine's name: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The gunman ran away with Valdez’s car and crashed into it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was killed by his wife and two adult children.
Rumors are moving quickly and swirling freely in Culiacan.
The death of Valdez is still uncertain.
Sinaloa has been one of Mexico’s bloodiest battlefields since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
One or more people are shot to death on the streets of Sinaloa every day, and the cemetery has decorative two-storey tombs of drug barons that are larger than many households.
In a coastal state, it’s “peaceful” when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Riodocen founder and director, the 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez. He leads a competing group that is waging war against the sons of Guzman.
The case may have upset Guzman’s sons: customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as it reached the point of sale.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up Riodocen with five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem,” Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine became aware of its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by things that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez was awarded the International Press Freedom Award by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage to keep track of the Mexican drug trade story.
He openly admitted he was afraid.
“I want to be able to continue my life,” he said when he received the award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Drug trafficking is a “life style” in Sinaloa, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“A journalist must take on the task that falls upon him – or act as a fool.
I don’t want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown here—why didn’t I tell you what was going on?”
The staff in Rio de Janeiro are in need of Valdez, a joker who curses like a port worker. They are in need of a friend who always gives them a hug and advice. They are in need of a teacher who knows how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore pancakes.
He went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the delivery and always sat at the same table.
Now they are asking if the routine came to his fate.
The death of a colleague has also made them think about how they can best do their job and stay alive.
“The criminals don’t like it if we deal with their wives and children and their clean business, their secret drug trade tracks.
They were left out of the story,” Bojorquez said.
It meant, at best, strong self-censorship and self-protection.
Trust in your instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, you have to stay away.
Andres Villarreal, a reporter at Riodoc, said the problem is that “the impression can be deceiving, and so was the case with Javier.”
The old rules no longer apply to Sinaloa, nor do they apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The working environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodocen’s security training was held. A few days earlier it was revealed that only spyware sold to governments had tracked activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought protection in the shade of a tree from the heat of 40 degrees.
The state government had ordered them to guard the Riodocen premises, located in a four-story building in the middle class district of Culiacan.
Some of the journalists guessed in half a joke whether these two police officers were among the 50 percent that the governor of the state did not consider reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week’s issue, Riodocen’s delivery planned three main cases.
Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government’s money was concentrated in the governor’s home town.
In addition, in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just a quarter from the prosecutor’s office, a group of people were kidnapped.
There was no official information about who was abducted and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and the authorities.
The journalist learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in cases that have gained much publicity.
Villarreal asked a reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place. In one of them "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they would get reliable information about the abduction from the Valdez column.
“We would have known before what had happened,” says the 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed “El Flaco” because of his thin body.
“Now all connections to our data sources are broken.”
Valdez’s office has been transformed into a warehouse with anti-persecution signs and labels. The newspaper’s employees have received a new, unexpected task: they have become activists for freedom of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with her on her way to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration over another murder of the journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burnt body was found, which according to DNA tests carried out by the authorities is Adam.
Journalists have begun to protest more loudly throughout the country.In the protests, “SOS Press” texts appear on the hallways and buildings.
Today, leader Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to get international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
On the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they told the truth.
He has since requested that he be removed from government matters because he is concerned that he is unable to be objective in his hatred.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime, authorities allowing crime, and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narco-Journalism, Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed on the orders of politicians and security forces in concert with organized crime.
According to Articulo 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were committed by police and authorities.
“In Mexico, people are silenced by killing,” Ramirez says.
Murder has a paralyzing effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
At his body was a message signed by the Zetas cartel: “I am here because of my writings.”
Next to his cut off head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to shut down, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue to operate, such as the Nuevo Laredo El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message on its homepage to the drug cartels: “What do you want from us?”
Some of the journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
The decision is difficult.
In exile it is difficult to find a job, and you have to be vigilant all the time.
Sometimes criminals were looking for a journalist in their hands, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had fled Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was supposed to become a poet, admits that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
“I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell,” he says.
Some time ago, on Friday at midnight, the journalists at Riodoc were sitting in front of the delivery on the sidewalk with beer when the latest issue of the journal had been finished.
In a shooting between rival gangs and security forces at a beach resort in Mazatlan, 19 people were killed.
The war accelerated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Journalists put the news on the Riodoke website from the hallway on their smartphones.
The priority had to be resumed the next day.
The sirens sounded nearby, another shooting.
Bojorquez looked at the police guarding the delivery:
If they were afraid, they covered it very well.
The Riodocen edition continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait in which a man shows the middle finger to the whole of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can’t even consider stopping the activity. “How could I shut down the magazine when our trainer asked to get out on the street to do the matter on the same day that Javier was murdered?”
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge backstorm - "Hard Place"
In April, the celebration of Hannu Manninen, who turned 39, was short, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training season began catastrophically when Manninen fell ill with a cold.
This led to a long period of illness that lasted almost five weeks.
The month of May was almost completely sick.
First there was a cold and finally a childhood illness like ear infection, for which I had to take a course of antibiotics.
I was able to do only 10 percent of the planned exercises.
I can’t remember the last time I had so much pain.
It was a tough place when I couldn’t take advantage of the training experience, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanom.
Testing collapsed
The 2007 world champion was granted a training permit only in the second week of June, as was revealed in the KIHU rolling mat test conducted by the Competition and Top Sports Research Center on June 12.
In the test, the athlete skies on a rolling carpet, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a milk acid sample from the athlete’s fingertips with a needle.
Last autumn I spent 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
It was on the wall, the man told me.
In a better direction
After the first signs of illness, she said she was healthy.
I have done a variety of calm aerobic exercises with which I have sought to normalize the metabolism of the body.
We have a really good five-week period.
We also had a one-and-a-half-week vacation from the flight.
I also went to the house with my family.
In the last season, Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening race, when Manninen climbed 18th in the top ski.
Guidelines taken
Manninen and the national team’s head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan that runs until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm of training compared to last season.
After the first match, the team will have a three-week World Cup weekend.
It is planned to take part in at least one World Cup weekend in December, in Ramsau.
At the end of January, it is planned to be in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that the name will be on the list of the Olympic team, Manninen said.
The PyeongChang Olympics will be the sixth Winter Olympics in her career.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, with the numbered underline celebrating gold at the 2002 Salt Lake City team competition.
The dinosaur defended himself from the enemy.
At first it looks like a scary statue.
Now, scientists have revealed the first findings of a horn-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner that was so well preserved that experts call it the dinosaur’s Mona Lisa.
It was so well preserved that scientists could even determine that its skin was red brown and had a “problematic past.”
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and one of the best representatives of its species in the world.
The newly discovered fossil is a nodosaurus that lived between 110 and 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this surprisingly well preserved fossil to be a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, armored vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil of all time.
It was discovered at the Suncor Millenium mine in Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He struck something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to study his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrrell.
There, the beast was excavated for six years from a 1,100-kilogram block.
The results of hard work can now be seen.
“If you shake your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep,” says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum.
“It goes into the history of science as the dinosaur’s Mona Lisa, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Skin studies revealed that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor masked it from predators, and it was also protected by a darker and lighter color, which is still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to mix with its environment and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old nodosaurus rose to headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrrell.
Scientists have named it Borealope after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician, who was part of a team that took more than 7,000 hours to dig out the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so surprisingly well that Mitchell and an international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body’s thighs and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a common coloring, where the body is darker from the top and lighter from the bottom.
The observation was still a surprise, as Borealope is significantly larger than current animals with similar coloring.
It can be concluded that the dinosaurs who ate meat plundered it to such an extent that evolution preferred hiding as a way of survival rather than fighting.
Of the present animals, for example, pears, seepro and armadillo have a similar coloring. They are significantly smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that the nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
“The prey of a large, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the conjunction were,” Brown says.
A chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the nodosaurus flies revealed that its skin was red brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, among other things, they have studied the contents of its intestines to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe it fell into a river when it died and drove into the ocean, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.
Alberta was at that time as warm as it is now in Florida, and the rivers and seas probably extended much further than today.
“This nodosaurus is really remarkable because it has preserved its vertical skin and has also been preserved in its three-dimensional original shape,” Brown says.
That’s why it looks almost the same as in the early joint.
It doesn’t require much imagination to paint it: if you shake your eyes a little, you can almost believe it was asleep.”
The union era was the era of the teropods, the enormous two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Though their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years earlier than Boreal, its powerful predecessors may have captured this armored dinosaur.
The predecessor of the Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, the Acrocanthosaurus, an approximately 11.5 meter tall six-ton monster.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus scientists have been published in the journal Current Biology. They believe that Borealope was washed into the ocean after his death and mummified in mud.
It was discovered at the Suncor Millenium mine in Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, with its leather and armor from scratch to hip.
The nodosaurs were on average five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
There were two half-metre slopes.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian travelled through present-day Western Canada until a flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has been preserved to the smallest details in a submarine tomb.
Its fossilized remains have been preserved so well that its leather is still left in the hollow plates of the armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such survival is “just as rare as winning a lottery.
The closer you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The hollow plates of its skull armor still contain fossilized leather.
His right foot is on his side, five fingers upwards.
I can also cut my feet down.”
How did an activist learn to answer the question: Who belongs to the streets?
Brittany Ferrell was shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived a day earlier in New York from his home in St. Louis and was sitting on the bed of his airbnb apartment browsing Facebook with his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high school friend:
“The police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and his body is still on the street.”
Confused, she noticed that no one else had posted the same information on her feed.
His timeline had numerous re-quotes from the user @TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to a St. Louis rapper who tweeted in real-time about Michael Brown's death. White police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black man in Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user also posted a picture of Brown’s dead body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
“This is incredible,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later that night, people were told there were gathering to Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police locksmiths and screaming people, as well as a man who claimed to be Brown’s father, with a sign that read: “Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!”
Ferrell watched a real-time video of the police standing in front of the demonstrators with a licking dog.
He said he also saw a video in which another police officer raised his rifle and shouted, “I’ll kill you all... animals.”
“This is not normal,” Ferrell remembers.
“It wasn’t a kind of murder we’ve been accustomed to and could be called typical.
I felt cold colors.
I was angry and I was crying.”
He booked a return flight for the next day.
Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from his father and decided that they would leave for Ferguson the next morning.
About what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next almost three years, the documentary “Who’s the Streets?” premiered in theaters on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the perspective of the local people who went out to the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with his daughter wearing a flower robe and a crown suitable for it, they talked again about “how it feels to live as a black man and in what circumstances.”
“Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?” says Ferrell.
“We’re going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that’s not right.”
“I couldn’t help but take my daughter with me,” Ferrell later told me.
“The events of today are... the culmination of events of the past.
My daughter has a right to know it and grow up in it.
He must acquire skills for activism and organization, but he must also know the different layers and conditions of living as a black person.
Though I’m fortunate to have been able to protect her from brutal racism, she’s still like the other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt him if I protected him from reality.”
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, opposite the police station. It became a camp for activists as they waited for information about the case and finally learned that police would not be charged.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packs.
They packed their lunch in bags and distributed it to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to approach activism in a new way.
“My activism changed completely after August 9,” she says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of the organization of minority nursing students. At that time, he focused on food rights and health disparities in black communities.
“I didn’t have any experience organizing.
Somehow it just happened.”
Weeks later, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, the documentary’s assistant director, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "simply wanted to tell" what was happening.
Ferrell was in doubt and asked, “Do you really want to tell me what’s going on, or do you want a story you can use?”
The backdrop of the suspicion was the countless occasions when people, usually white, had appeared in the local community, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and persistence.
“We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson didn’t have a common voice,” Folayan said recently in an interview.
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism with death-prisoned prisoners.
Davis’ involvement led Ferrell to join the project together with six other locals.The filming team followed the events in the years following Brown’s shooting.
“This is not a documentary where someone is speaking to us or speaking for us, but we are speaking,” Davis says.
“For me, the most important thing was how the locals are portrayed in the movie, because I am portrayed in the same way.”
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrell’s experiences, as it was to show that the popular movement “is not about a charismatic leader but about a community.”
That’s why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and getting married.
“I felt pretty naked,” Ferrell laughs when she tells me how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
“But I realized that this work and human portrayal of blacks requires some vulnerability.”
Furthermore, Ferrell’s story times and brings back to the focus the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after police shot a black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012.
“The leadership of black queer women has sustained the whole movement,” says Ferrell. “It’s because we have to fight on many fronts.
The black queer women have had to endure everything.”
Folayan agrees: “The movement is indeedined by black women, among whom there are many queer women.”
However, he emphasizes that Ferrelli was not selected for the document “for its own purpose” because of his queer identity.
“He got the energy to move,” Folayan says.
“It’s not a coincidence, however, that she was in the front line. Black queer women live in the middle of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the white skin.”
News shooters have left Ferguson a long time ago, but tensions between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for blocking the highway during a demonstration.
His description of the social-political atmosphere of his home corners is short and concise: “Sekasotku.”
Still, he still relies on the slogan he learned outdoors on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains.”
Artist Creates Portraits From Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the Fridman Gallery in New York, faces are hanged in the center of the exhibition hall – white, black and brown faces, which can be seen by closer look.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning’s cheeks and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth prison where he served his 35-year sentence. Manning was convicted of leaking secret diplomatic emails to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg’s A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on August 2, 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in her work. Manning is a transgender and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence Barack Obama mitigated to the third last day of his term.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. These are a sharp, though slightly theoretical statement on the modifiability of DNA data, the ambiguity and the underlying cause-effect relationships and identity of interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly stated that she has identified herself with women since she was a teenager and was found guilty in 2013 of 20 crimes, including spying, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning sentenced to prison: a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning sits in the car as the driver.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a popular project called Stranger Visions, which he launched in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data. He obtained DNA data from, for example, smoking cravings and chewing gums and created images of what the people in question could have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case,” Dewey-Hagborg told a news conference at the new show.
Manning could not be visited and could not be photographed in prison, so the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked if he would be interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned mum suddenly became correspondent-mates.
They even together made a comic book, Suppressed Images, depicted by Shoili Kanungo. It depicted a future in which the president would have mitigated Chelsea’s sentence and he would be allowed to watch the show.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning’s sentence only a few days after the comic book was released.It was a lucky coincidence after seven rough years in a military prison in Kansas.
It is also impressive that the exhibition opens right now as Donald Trump is waging his own war against data leaks and transgender soldiers and is coming up with new ways on Twitter to strengthen those powerful divisions he was actually supposed to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that “everything has a purpose.”
On the wall of the gallery is a statement of the artist and underneath it a large signature of Manning, where the point of the surname i is the heart. In his statement the artist calls for an end to “the automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based.”
The opposite wall has Manning’s DNA section: a long string of letters C, G, and A written with a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or a nucleotide, as the artist’s scientific definition says – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are all, at least in our biology.
“I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in our genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation,” says Dewey-Hagborg.
“DNA tells countless stories, here are 30 of them.”
The final work of the exhibition is in his own room: a page from a comic book by Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
In it, Manning’s character rises out of prison like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
“If they get you silenced, they have won,” the picture reads.
“Never be silent.”
“The text is from a letter I received from Manning,” says the artist from Philadelphia.
“It’s so impressive that I still get cold colors.”
Contrary to what was depicted in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the show. When Manning arrived, he was greeted by a face based on his own genetic data like a group of protesters in the middle of the showroom.
It’s intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning’s DNA section is written with a pencil to a height equal to his length (157,5 cm).
“The faces used to be on the wall, but I wanted to make them feel like a crowd,” says Dewey-Hagborg.
“I wanted to portray the mass movement that Chelsea gave birth to, which was also behind his release.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee sought as suspects
Police have launched national searches to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are suspected of killing a man in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
Cook County Court documents indicate that on Monday arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being knipped several times.
According to a local news release released by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple incision wounds on his body.
Authorities say Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the knife was being investigated as murder.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, university deputy director of social relations, said in an email statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
“This is a criminal case that is being investigated by the authorities and Northwestern University is helping in the investigation,” Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A statement sent by the university and Somerville College spokesman said: “We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the authorities investigating the case in the United States in every possible way.”
The statement said Warren’s colleagues were shocked and hoped he would surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief Information Officer of the Chicago Police Department, said he urged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have an idea of where they are, and we are constantly updating our searches,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and national authorities are assisting in the search for the suspects.
He said the police had received a call from a Grand Plaza host who had received a vague hint that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as horrible.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the victim was murdered the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been inside the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi says.
Grand Plaza’s management team issued the following message to residents: “Police is currently investigating the course of the events and the victim’s background, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence.”
Man threatens to blow up Islamic bookstore and 'kill Muslims' in London
“I’m not an anti-Muslim, I’m a Catholic,” the convict told police.
Moffatt is required to perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and “kill all Muslims.”
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of harassment.
Police said the staff of the bookstore alerted them on May 23.
The police said the man had “threatened to blow up a bookstore and kill Muslims.”
The suspect left after threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police for a threat.
The threat had nothing to do with the bookstore.
Authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same suit as the suspect in the bookstore events, a police spokesman said.
“I’m not an anti-Muslim, I’m a Catholic,” Moffatt told police during interrogation.
As a penalty, the man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay £620 or approximately €690 in court costs and £85 or approximately €95 in compensation to the victims.
A spokesman for Scotland Yard said a number of hate crimes were not.
“We will complete the WADA Roadmap in the near future” – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the WADA roadmap to restore the powers of the Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA.
“Some of the roadmap measures have already been implemented and RUSADA has been granted the right to design and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA roadmap has been updated in these respects,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap, which sets out the conditions for the restoration of RUSADA’s powers.
According to him, there is nothing to worry about in Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything is being implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future,” Mutko added.
However, one point in the roadmap requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly approve the results of the WADA ordered investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.
Mutko said: “The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted a failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programs, and we cannot admit something that didn’t exist.”
This was by Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
Earlier on the same day, speaking to the Russian sports media RSport, Smirnov admitted that there were problems with the Russian anti-doping agencies. “We have said several times that there are controversial statements and regulations in the report.
We will not accept the report unconditionally,” he added.
WADA ordered Russia to close doping controls in Russia in November 2015 after the scandal was uncovered.
However, it was granted permission last June to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA’s headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he stated that the organization was “on the right path” towards restoring its powers.
British organization skeptical about Finnish-loved innovation: There is no evidence of the health benefits of maternity packaging
British organizations doubt the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
The BBC and the Guardian that Lullaby Trust has banned the use of its own brochures in maternity packages distributed in the UK.
The delivery of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some regions.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that maternity packaging would reduce the risk of hidden death.
Hidden death means the unexplained sudden death of a baby.
Lullaby Trust is an expert of the UK health authorities on safe sleep for children.
We will no longer allow the packaging of our official brochures on them because it would suggest that we recommend this product.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, with only two deaths per thousand births.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is the result of many different reasons, including the low number of teenage pregnancies.
The fact that there is a box for every family there may be one factor.
But it can’t be said for sure,” said Francine Bates, chief executive of Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packaging is being marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and hidden deaths.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers for free in Finland for 80 years.
The package contains various accessories, such as children’s clothes.
This year there are 53 products.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to sleep.
The Scottish government says the boxes it distributes meet all security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a sleeping place.
According to the Lullaby Trust, the package can be the best option as a sleeping place if there is no fence or overbed available.
The organization recommends using the package only for daytime sleep and stop using it when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets away from the packaging and making sure they are not wet or dirty.
Japanese horse escapes from zoo
The Japanese Zoo is looking for a dead turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised staff with its speed and escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, Japan on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the animal was leaving the zoo through the main entrance.
It doesn’t die right away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we’re very concerned,” said Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo.
The 35-year-old is a female, weighs 55 kilos and is about a meter long.
Yamane describes the runner as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, it is allowed to move freely through the area.
The zoo has not received eyewitness observations of the turtle.
The last crash happened last week.
Yamane found the fugitive walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I saw it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These Startups Will Help Your Business Avoid Uber Errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys were anonymous, some employees treated them with suspicion.
“The surveys were simply neither consistent nor objective,” Errett says. As her hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on online shopping. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to external help.
More and more new types of HR startups have entered the market to help other companies figure out how their employees can.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement. Companies can conduct surveys and target them to specific teams and population groups, as well as provide their employees with anonymous reporting services and in some cases direct contact with top management beyond the government.
“You can monitor your health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit for companies?” asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of the Glint startup in Redwood City.
Errett has been using Glint software for three years and says he has gained a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program enables quick surveys and voting for specific teams. In addition, it can draw up a map of which you can see in a glance which departments are most dissatisfied with employees and which managers have received the lowest ratings.
Companies have understood that they have to follow the workplace culture to prevent them from becoming the next Uber. The transportation company has been swirling since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where employees are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such negligences are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry with a potential value of more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to Let’s Talk Payments.
Convercent, based in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent misconduct. Interest in the company grew earlier this year as Uber’s reputation fell.
Convercent has 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He also recently signed an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct tailored surveys, confidentially collect answers in real time, and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behavior anonymously by text message.
And if there is a reason to suspect the manager of incompetence, the complaints go directly to the board of directors of the company.
“The public opinion has outstretched the authorities,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He reminds that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can become costly even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and be challenged in court.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations. The company has been using Convercenti for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have easy access to the headquarters.
Previously, it was a practice that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to first find out the phone number or email address with which he could make a notification to the headquarters.
“It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience,” says James Vitrano, Legal Director at Ruby Tuesday.
Previously, problems remained hidden from managers working in another city or state. Now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and handled faster.
“I get a more holistic and comprehensive insight into the reality of the employee,” says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management team.
“At the same time, we protect our shareholders from legal proceedings relating to employment relations.”
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical activities in the Enron scandal.
It was only with the social media that companies realized that they could no longer prevent the public investigation of their clothes.
“Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the control of ethics,” Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service for which use is regularly charged.
It is a business model and opportunity accepted by equity investors. Both Glint and Convercent have equity investors.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital. It has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received €10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investments are not a surprise considering the links between, corporate culture and venture capital.
Studies have shown that employees expect more from their jobs.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good salaries, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
“Employees are more committed to a company’s success if they are happy in the company and feel that they are listened to and that their work is rewarding,” said Nina McQueen, CEO of LinkedIn’s Employee Rewarding and Welfare.
Investors get a return when companies succeed, companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it’s no wonder they are interested in investors.
According to experts in workplace culture, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if no action is taken on its basis.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered a sign of change.
And if the change doesn’t come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
“If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand discussions,” said Russell Raath, CEO of business consultancy Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on merely gathering information.
“If the company does not take action, employees start to wonder whether they have been heard.
Do their opinions matter?
If the company doesn’t care about them, why should they care about the company?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed is now conducting staff surveys monthly and will be able to address the problem on the same day it is announced in Glint.
After Errett had gathered feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated employees, he was able to make changes in teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees even better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve staff persistence over the long term in an industry known for its high volatility of employees.
“If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees,” says Vitrano.
If you lose employees, you also lose customers.
Without customers, there is no business.”
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of cheating on his naked female neighbor, reports TT news agency.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at home when she had noticed a cell phone hanging at the end of the rope outside her window.
The woman said her cell phone camera photographed the apartment.
The woman, frightened by the incident, ran into another room to dress up.
When the woman arrived to check the situation, the cell phone was first pulled up, but soon thereafter dropped back into the window.
The 20-year-old suspect has admitted to portraying a woman.
He said he was only depicting a woman’s face.
The video recorded on the phone had been removed, and the police were unable to return it as evidence.
During the interrogation, the man admitted to the crime but denied that he had committed the crime.
He said he loved his neighbor, saying he loved his neighbor "just crazy."
According to news agency TT, the man is being charged in the case.
Teachers call for more money in autumn negotiations
Wage growth cannot be lower than in the export industry, for example, but the gap should be narrowed, OAJ Chairman Olli Luukkainen said on Thursday.
The temporary cuts in public sector holiday pensions highlight the difference, he points out.
We do not have the possibility to conclude contracts in which vacation savings are not included in the review.
In the municipal sector, contracts will only be concluded when the private sector papers have been signed and the increasing percentages are clear.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ’s working conditions have been agreed in January.
The target percentage has not yet been revealed.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, the public sector trained negotiating organization.
LUCKIEN: Vacation cut increases earnings disparities
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is weakening, while at the same time the purchasing power of the private sector is growing.
According to Luukkainen, the periodic vacation money reduction will further sharpen earnings development differences.
In Finland, it should be defined how many students per teacher can be
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the weakest are growing all the time.
According to the organization, learning outcomes are deteriorating, and differences between students and regions are constantly increasing.
Bruins Players' Day Extended as NCAA Reduced Daily Exercises from Two to One
It’s about eleven o’clock in the evening.A group of UCLA American football players have left to talk to the other edge of the new training fields on campus.
Some have taken off their shirt and their backs glitter after the first day of the training camp.
For many of them, this few-minute conversation is a lunch break.
After three hours of training, players studying at the university’s summer classes will return to the hostel to read for final exams. The next morning they will gather at half seven at the Wasserman Football Center.
“The next three days will be tough for these guys,” said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before changing Monday to Tuesday.
The University Sports Board reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one.The change was intended to ease the workload of the players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final tests are held.
That’s why UCLA’s first three exercises started at four o’clock over seven o’clock in the evening.
The limitation of training sessions to one day means that there will be more training days than before. This year the camp started almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in Moran's six-year Westwood training season, when the training takes place at the same time as the summer classes.
The exercises are scheduled to take place 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the opening match of the season begins: UCLA will face Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says he supported the NCAA’s rule change, even though it made the players’ schedules even stricter.
“We’re really burdening them a lot for three or four days, and that’s very challenging,” Mora says.
“But the players are ready to work, they’re great guys.
I think the situation will get easier when we get to Saturday.
UCLA closes the exercises from outsiders after the camp. It's not easy given the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking lot and to the Luskin Center, a high-end hotel that has already been bombarded with soccer balls flying over the protective net behind the goal.
Bruins players are scheduled to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available to outsiders.
“We have security arrangements,” Mora says.
“The trouble is that people can book a room and record exercises for video.
A lot of videos are paid for.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We do our best.
I will not bother my head too much.
We have a plan.”
Freedom in Rwanda
A presidential election is scheduled in Central Africa on Friday, with the winner being announced.
Paul Kagame is officially aiming for his third season, but in practice he has been influencing the country since 1994.
Then the rebel group RPF stopped the genocide organized by extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticized, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of speech.
He is also accused of distorting poverty statistics.
Kagame will be able to run for a third term because of the amendment of the Constitution, which limited the presidential term to two terms.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely regarded leader.
During his time, social reforms have been carried out in Rwanda and international investments have flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting the country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has prompted many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagamekin has promised more freedom to his people after the country has been raised to its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook to Fight Fake News by Enhancing Fact Checking
Facebook plans to send potential fake news more and more frequently to independent fact-checks, as well as present the results under the original article.
The company published a statement on its website stating that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Potential fake news will be sent to facts reviewers and the results may be published below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest disseminators of fake news. Many believe that fake news influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The topic has risen into political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed with fake news before the May presidential election, and Germany, preparing for the September elections, supports a plan to fine social media networks if they do not remove hostile content promptly.
In a separate statement released in Germany on Thursday, Facebook announced that facts are being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“People want to see which stories don’t go through the scrutiny of independent auditors. They also want more background information so they can make more informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing,” Facebook news feed product manager Sara Su wrote on the company’s blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the Related Articles feature and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce the number of fake news.
The Birth of a Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
The small Scotty Castle in Kent County is now known for Squeeze’s music video and Margaret Thatcher’s hiding place from the 1970s and 1980s.
Now this charming castle in the valley of the Bewli River is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, an old-fashioned writer.
“I think it’s great to study the text written by a person who died over 300 years ago,” Rhodes said.
“I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand.”
The book of Rhodes, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes’ first book based on archives. In 2014, he published Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories, whose inspiration came from documents from the British National Library.
“I moved into tears when I noticed a fingerprint in the letter, which was written by a double agent who worked for the Yacobites in the 17th century,” Rhodes says.
It was his fingerprint.
And the letters smell smoke, because at the time fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel like he is on the spot.
I love the archives.”
The writer, fascinated by the old documents, was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Council of the Arts of England, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent his days exploring the Victorian “new” castle, archives, treasures, and rarities, such as hyena heads hanging on the walls and bottles that had been in the tomb for centuries.
He walked through the ruins and farms of the old castle and talked with forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes artists portraying books.
In the evening, he took a whiskey and started writing.
The closer history of Scotney is quite unknown, as the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the foundation staff was just beginning to go through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: transporting all the extra to the loft.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, and maps of who owned what. „You can imagine that land disputes are boring,” says Rhodes. „Here, however, families even fought for one berry.
I thought it would be allowed to be.”
Some of the book's stories go from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer. It tells about a man who is associated soon after the castle's completion with the English peasant uprising in 1381.
“The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex report that there was a riot in the castle in 1380,” Rhodes says.
The English peasant uprising began in the same area, and it came to mind that the uprising could begin with an uprising.
Per these events are interrelated?”
Other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, the story of the priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler tells the story of the 17th century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrels are Rhodes’ favourite family in Scottie. “The men in the family seem to have been pretty wicked. They were constantly in debt and bought things they could not afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women.I see them as good guys who were able to flatter heirs.”
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Elämänmäki, a sanatorium operating at the beginning of the 20th century, of which only a refined plot remains.
Scotty Castle has a special place in his heart.
“It was sad to leave,” he says.
“I didn’t want to go back to this evil day.”
Russia is the worst country since the Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated significantly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek closer cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
According to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in a political dialogue with Russia to avoid an exacerbation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s comments, U.S. President Donald Trump was able to say that relations between the U.S. and Russia had dropped to a dangerously poor level.
Trump also expressed his gratitude to Congress for approving new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitschko to resign against Anthony Joshua
World Heavyweight champion Vladimir Klitschko has ended his career.
Ukrainian citizen Klitschko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Klitschko scored gold 69 times as a professional, winning 64 games.
He held several World Championships in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitschko lost his last two matches in his career.
Tyson Fury struck him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitschko met Anthony Joshuan at Wembley Stadium and lost after a fierce match with a break in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitschko are expected to meet in a re-match in Las Vegas in November.
However, Klitschko did not find any motivation for the match.
I deliberately used a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance for the Wembley match," Klitschko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after the sport.
I could never have imagined that I would have had such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for it.
Check out Klitschko’s reasons for his decision in the video.
Klitschko manager Bernd Bönte said in a statement that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitschko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he doesn’t have enough motivation anymore.
This is definitely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitschko has been dating American actress Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple have one child, a daughter, Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitschko’s older brother, Vitali, is also a former world heavyweight champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated the world championships of different federations at the same time.
Finnish weathercriminal witches circumstances: "Vie from fiil"
Minna Nikkanen has suffered from circumstances during the summer outdoor rail season.
He had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken the woman from the fireplace.
The World Cup in London is in a very unstable situation.
He talks about the weather.
The circumstances have been this year against the windshield jumpers going to Nick.
I don’t want to blame the wheel, but it was incomprehensible that I didn’t even get the small sheets to move properly,” Nikkanen said after the race in Innsbruck.
I have competed and practiced here as many times and I have never experienced such variation in the wind here,” Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
In this season, it has been really difficult to standardize the jump, as there have been so unstable winds in the exercises, Nikkanen said in Kaleva’s competition.
Weather in London on Thursday.
It has been quite challenging to get the technology together – whether it’s a cold freeze or what.
It’s been cold and windy, and it’s taken from the fire.
It makes no sense to consume energy in bad conditions.
He won the world championship with his hall jump 455.
There are 445.
The situation in London is not the same for everyone.
We have to stay calm and wait for better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 at Friday’s cut.
Why not train abroad?
It is not necessary.
Last summer I went to Italy and Germany.
I got a jump and the technique was standard.
I think I should have done the same now.
He has been trained in the hall, but now the hall is closed.
What is the ideal race?
25 degrees of heat.
There is a small wind as long as it is constant.
An experienced ex-functionary grumbled on politicians in Ylella: "We have not had any distribution funds now and for many years"
Despite the positive climate in the economy, Juha Sipilä’s government must keep the ice in its hat and warn against swelling the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets at the Ministry of Finance for decades.
He says there is no distribution.
He was interviewed in 2015 by a retired Virtá on Wednesday 1st.
The next year’s budget is just beginning.
Recently, politicians’ proposals to raise the guarantee pension, to reduce the car tax and to support electric bikes, among others, Virtanen considers to be election speeches.
They mostly indicate that the elections are beginning to be near, because with ten percent of the state budget being funded by additional debt, we have no resource for allocation now and for many years.
I think it is even cheating to talk about sharing assets when borrowing, Virtanen said to Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all the debt is owed to the children.
Virtas has a long experience in the preparation of state budgets: he began in 1978 as Budget Secretary at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head of the Budget Department and Budget Manager.
Prior to his retirement, he served as Chancellor of the Ministry of Labour and Commerce.
Virtanen pointed out in an interview with Yle that the three-percent economic growth now forecast is likely to be temporary.
All predictors estimate that this is a peak from which we will go to the bottom line next year, and Finland is expected to grow by one percent for decades.
Washington changes rules for permanent residence
President Donald Trump has announced that the rules for the permanent residence permit, the Green Card, will be changed with a new immigration plan.
They aim to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the President will support them.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayer money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain migration and replace the current program.
“The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
The Danish Queen’s husband wants to be buried in the same place as the Queen.
Prince Henrik will not be buried with Queen Margaret.
Prince Henrik and Queen Margaret in April.
Queen Margaret of Denmark, 77, and her husband, Prince Henry, 83, will not be buried next to each other.
Traditionally, the ruling couples in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The royal palace has announced today that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to the newspaper, the reason for this is the Prince’s dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It’s no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, court communications chief Lene Belleby said.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried next to the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated equally with her spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of her spouse’s wish for a place to be buried and understands the decision.
Horrible moment on the road: the car was to come on the highway
In the car was a girlfriend and two young children.
They are not injured in the accident, but do not receive insurance money if the other party is not reached.
The accident occurred at the gateway.
Archive for Construction III.
Tommi says his family survived a miracle trade in a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his spouse Riina and the couple’s two young children were driving on the motorway at Keimolanport in Vanda in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
From the connection of Kehä III to the Hämeenlinnanvägen, a white car was driving along the accelerator track, which was to drive to the side of a family car, Tommi says.
Without it, the car would have been on Tom’s side.
I stopped and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi says.
The family’s car crashed at a high speed.
The parents and two children on the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is a little under 3 years old, the other is less than a year old.
We were very lucky when nothing happened to us.
No one came by, even though there was a lot of traffic.
The accident occurred around 17:20.
Tommi said no one stopped at them, and the family called the emergency center.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and rescue personnel arrived and the family was checked.
The car went to rescue.
Tommi says he and his spouse have a small income, and they received a subsidy from the family to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of the other car, the family will not receive money from the insurance.
Therefore, the family hopes that eyewitnesses will find out about the car that caused the family to drive into the lane.
We need a car every day.
It is difficult to take children to the garden and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old garment car.
It was probably in the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thought the beginning of the car’s registration number was SIG.
If we don’t get the culprit caught, I don’t know how we’ll manage financially, we’ll have to count every penny today.
Tommi hopes that anyone who has seen the incident or knows anything about it will contact the police.
The Eastern New Zealand Police Department and the Central New Zealand Rescue Service confirmed that they had a duty on the scene of the accident on Tuesday night.
Title and case corrected at 21.15: Contrary to what was originally stated in the story, the other car did not come to the front lane, according to Tomm, but was to drive from the accelerator track to the side of the family car.
The show, directed by Lotta Jäppinen, deals with human relationships by means of humor - The self-revealer is seen in the What? theatre on Friday and Saturday.
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvolan brings her first-born direction to What? theater.
The self-revelator is a musical theater performance about past human relationships and inadequacy.
Director Lotta Jäppinen says it will still be a good idea.
The subject is dealt with with humor.
There are no unpleasant feelings, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the touring summer theatre performance was carried out with a small budget and a large, young heart.
The title of the show challenges to reflect on what a person reveals about himself when he meets a new person.
Is he going to pull a role or is he approaching another jacket?
The story confuses fact and fiction.
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatized the show.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The proposal consists of the text of the working group and does not contain a plot.
The director believes that although the show draws on the thoughts of young people, it speaks to people of all ages.
Jäppinen emphasizes that the Self-Revelator does not directly tell about his or her own or the work group’s interpersonal relationships.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
I’m sure I’m concerned about the show.
I do not think that human relationships are bad, but I do not think that human relationships, especially couples, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from their divorced parents.
Jäppinen believes that the self-revelator is drawing a current picture of young adults living in a hundred-year-old Finland.
He said many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have been divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
There is no need for a bad relationship.

Finnish Olympic winner recovered for a year from a deadly motorcross accident - broken necklace
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
The Ace of the Coupleship travelled the world hundreds of days a year for a couple of decades and pursued his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtea movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainer, but also an experimentator of new species.
There are not many forms of exercise on earth that a chemist would not have tried at least once.
It inspired me to practice.
There’s always something new to be found, she tells me.
At the end of the day, one thing was to stop it completely.
In 2014, he suffered a motorcycle accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I was not working anywhere.
I had wounds in my home for a year, says Lahtela.
He had bad luck.
He also acknowledges that age may have been a part of the breakdown.
Driving on the road can sound awful.
I did not seek boundaries.
It’s just so hard that a 40-year-old doesn’t need to get too much.
After the accident, she was in a strange situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
He was a long-time coach of the Japanese freestyling team.
He started his career immediately after the end of his career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn’t really do much, she tells me.
During the training period Lahtela often challenged her protectors in slopes and physical tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that my thoughts didn’t even make sense.
Not even the species.
It was good to be in place.
I really it, because I really it.
A compulsory break inspired Lahtelan to become Finland’s head coach.
Without stopping, he was afraid he would have burned up.
In the body it is easier to find places that have been broken than intact!
Without the accident, I’t have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as a coach for the Finnish freestyling team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace the beetle species.
I switched motorcross to frisbee golf.
It went out of the pit immediately.
At the worst, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super enthusiast coach, he doesn’t want his coaches to be the same as him.
I don’t force everyone into the same way.
In our genre culture there is room to be one of its kinds and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtela says.
Sex robots are coming and we need to be worried
It’s here: a report on technological developments in the sex robot industry – just as it started to seem that 2017 could no longer be stranger.
Just so only.
Sex robots are a big deal.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
“We need to start taking the spread of sex robots seriously,” said Noel Sharkey, founder of the foundation and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot’s eyes, the shape of the nipples, and the type of fingernails.
“Sex robots are being cracked, but they’re already being sold a lot, and we’re going to see more of them,” Sharkey said at the release ceremony.
Sex shoes have evolved from blowable dolls to robots with warm-feeling silicone skin and features created by artificial intelligence that resemble human behavior.
Users can also customize the robot to their own preferences, ranging from the color of their eyes to the shape of their nipples and the type and color of their fingernails.
Even more worrying is that robots have a “personality” that makes Stepford’s women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex shoes have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, even if it’s dirty.
True Companion’s Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah looks awkward, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality is adapted as perfectly as possible to the personality of the user,” the company’s website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, feeling tired, or “this mood.”
There are many worrying features in the spread of sex robots. They replace genuine interpersonal relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and direct rape fantasies, when the user approaches a robot programmed to be silly and resistant, for example.
True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to a vibrator on its website:
“Women have a vibrator.Why shouldn’t men have a sex robot?”
Sex robots, however, are not just fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their spread and development indicates something darker and deeper in our culture: a recession from gender equality to sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one option among others.
Most men, of course, do not buy a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report indicates their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena say a lot about the spirit of time.
And many people start to behave strangely or offensively only when the market allows it.
It’s no coincidence that sex robots have become widespread at a time when women’s rights are threatened around the world and there is a president sitting in the White House who has boasted of harassing women.
The TV series The Handmaid’s Tale is not the most disturbing of its powerful visual language, such as images of hanged bodies and out-graved eyes.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now there seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Sex robots are being tried to make as much like real women (in proportions to porn stars) as is technically possible.
The developers of robots want their skin to feel authentic and their movements imitate human movements as well as possible.
However, their “personalities” are far from reality.
A robot cannot leave a relationship or situation.
They have no will, no history, no sign of independence, or anything that violates the fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
The slave.
Australian police suspect two terrorist attacks were planned by Islamic State leader
The leader of the Islamic State group led a group of Australian men suspected of plotting to carry the bomb onto an Etihad Airways plane.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a member of the Islamic State group was also sending parts of the bomb to Sydney.
The bomb was supposed to be carried to the plane on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before the security inspection.
Police do not specify why the operation was stopped.
Another plan by the suspected terrorists was to build a device that would emit toxic colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as public transportation.
Australian deputy federal commissioner Michael Phelan said the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four suspects were arrested on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation continues.
The good side of Trump?
Get Mitt Romney to appear to be a reflection of common sense
During the Trump period, it has already been repeated to the tired that the strong division of voters has also dispersed families on a daily basis.
On the eve of Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers advised on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to break our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump’s ability to unite families.
I am telling you this because my cousin lived with me in New York this week.He is a leftist poet living in Chicago who has long been in close confrontation with our family’s Republicans.
He reminded that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousin’s acquaintances—including a Republican supporter brother with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades—are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it’s a good thing, but in a broader sense, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new stream, but the distorting influence of his presidential term can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be afraid of his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more terrifying possibility that Trump will normalize the right-wing Republicans, who suddenly seem quite sensible compared to Trump.
I think of Mitt Romney’s restrained version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14 percent income tax (and his tax returns we’ve seen at least).
When Trump’s term is over, the Republican’s next presidential candidate just needs to be clear-minded, and it immediately feels like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the Central Park carousel. It is the largest carousel in the New York Park section and the best thing in New York to get for $3 without caffeine.
The horses of the carousel are enormous, the characters in the middle – disgusting clowns and horror-loving animals – are wicked, and the racing music behind them is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York’s landmarks are disappointed over time: the views of the tall buildings begin to get boring, the silhouette of the city becomes too familiar and the reality of the city doesn’t match the dreams.
Still, after 35 years, I have not completely overcome the fact that the Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a big traffic hub in north London.
The Central Park carousel, on the other hand, is still a strange magical experience – even to the extent that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two forty-year-old women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my review, but fortunately no one came to ask.
Instead, I was asked this week at the store to rate my “payment experience” on a scale of one to five stars before putting my credit card onto the reader.
The same thing happens in the cafe in my home corner, but there I also get the opportunity to combine an estimate of 15% service fee when I go to pick up coffee on the bench myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer service provider to put his personality into play in a situation where it is not needed.
The shopkeeper smiled with regret when I tired of giving my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi fired from Inter: “There was no trust in the management”
FC Inter has released Shefki Kuq from the job of coach.
The coach was previously assisted by Fabrizio Piccareta.
The other team will continue to perform its current tasks.
Piccareta has previously served as an assistant coach in Sunderland, England.
Piccareta, 51, who joined Inter’s training team in January, completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
FC Inter Chairman Stefan Håkans has expressed his regret.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
Shefki Kuq, however, no longer had the trust of the club’s management, and there was no other choice now, Håkans said in a statement.
Piccareta’s contract will last until the end of the season.
He is jointly responsible for the home match against HIFK tomorrow.
According to news reports, the team has been in trouble on Thursday.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the club’s assistant coaches, Piccareta and John Allen, had been removed.
Kuqi and Piccareta played a strong match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture from the 80s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
Violinist Linda Lampenius posted a photo of her youth on Instagram.
A number of insights have been added to the picture, which suggests that the musician is a 16-year-old student at the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself is surprised by a serious young woman watching the camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he communicates.
If you don’t see the picture, you can see it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
A year ago, she posted a photo of herself on Instagram.
In one picture she is seen 20 years ago, in the other she poses now, as a mother of two children.
In his photographic text, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a human being and refers to the eating disorders he suffered from when he was younger.
Twenty years ago and today.
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I’ve learned to like myself and how I look.
Following the text she had added the English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is clean.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders of previous years.
He was hospitalized at the age of 14 for anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, she also fell ill with bulimia, which was finally revealed only in 2006.
The healing began slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius sent to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for cuts in his wrists, which he received after falling into a cell, according to prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Friends Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door of his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he thought his girlfriend was a nighttime intruder who was hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they are going to appeal again because they consider the six-year sentence of Pistorius too mild.
The state prosecutor plans to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal is likely to be dealt with this year.
If the appeal is approved, Pistorius’ sentence could be extended to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, the country's foreign ministry said, according to bTV channel.
Police arrested a group of unlawfully camped people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that the Bulgarians had been released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campgrounds and already impose substantial fines on those who camp in areas other than those reserved for the purpose.
Inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The court said the court could impose a fine.
Liquid stock sinking - already sinking -7.7%

After approximately half an hour of trading, the general index OMXH of the Helsinki Stock Exchange had dropped by 0.3 percent to 9509.48 points and the OMXH25 of the most exchanged companies had dropped by 0.3 percent.
The stock exchange's total turnover was 41 million euros, of which nine million were the result announcer Nestetta.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may alleviate irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet high in meat protein and dairy products may relieve irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the UK. It causes abdominal cramps, swelling, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Those suffering from irritable bowel syndrome are generally advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid contained in the protein, tryptophan, helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen intestinal tolerance.
According to study leader Marco Colonna, immune cells protect the intestines and ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not enter the body.
Inflammatory cells are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance drops too close to inflammation, the result may be irritable bowel syndrome.
Experiments found that immunosuppressive cells were found in mice with specific bacteria in their intestines.
This bacterium needs tryptophan in order for immune cells to begin to emerge. tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
“We found a link between the Lactobacillus reuteri bacterium and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal gut microbiome,” says Professor Colonna.
“The more tryptophan in the diet of the mice, the more such immune cells they had.”
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammatory susceptibility.
In a study of immune cells that enhance tolerance, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, there were no such cells in mice of the same species, which were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbiomes of mice, or the normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the digestive tract.
When DNA in the intestines of mice was examined, six species of bacteria were detected in those mice that had immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were administered to mice grown in a sterile environment that had no intestinal microbiome and had no developed immune cells, immune cells began to appear.
The researchers wanted to find out how the bacteria affect the immune system. They grew Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in a liquid and transferred small amounts of fluid – without bacteria – to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells evolved into cells that strengthened resistance.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indol-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of cells that enhanced tolerance increased by about 50 percent.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of tryptophan from the Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, triptophan-related genetic defects have been observed in people with irritable bowel syndrome.
“We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inside surfaces of the intestines,” says Cervantes-Barragan.
“High levels of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuteri may contribute to their proliferation.”
Jose Mourinho says Manchester United got a “neron” in their ranks after signing an agreement with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a “neron” into their ranks by signing an agreement with Nemanja Matic. The midfielder made his debut in the ranks of Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for £40 million, started with a 2–1 win in Dublin, United’s last match ahead of the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed as a defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
Matic, however, was not in the best shape yet, as he was not on the Blue T-shirts Asia Tour before the start of the season. He was on the pitch for only 45 minutes – that needs to change before the start of the league season, Mourinho said.
“He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, and mindset make him a genius – he has the innate ability to think about football,” Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him be ready sooner than later.”
In addition to Matic, the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began cutting off his starting composition for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more new players, even though the club has already done a “brilliant job” by acquiring three of his four priority players.
“Three out of four – I have to thank the club for that,” he added.
“I’d be happier if I got all four, but they did a great job.”
German airstrikes hit Germany for two years.
The Finnish women's volleyball national team lost their fourth match of the World Championship to Germany straight away 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The level of German routine in playing is high.
Their game was equal in every sector, Finland’s head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two sets, Finland held its opponent tight, but in the third half Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and aggressively enough in certain places, we were able to play with them, Kangasniemi said.
Finland's most effective was Piia Korhonen, who collected 14 points.
Finland, which lost three of the four matches, will face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Jury has already sent challenges to Trump Jr. meeting with Russia
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaja.
A large jury summoned by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitzkaia, known for its ties to the Kremlin.
This was by Reuters news agency, which confirmed the announcement by the Wall Street Journal earlier on Thursday of a large jury meeting.
According to Reuters, a large jury has sent challenges in connection with a meeting between Trump Jr. and Kremlin-linked Veselnitskaja, which took place during the June 2016 U.S. presidential election.
There were also Donald Trump Sr. campaign manager Paul Manafort and his aunt, the current White House adviser Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has summoned a large jury in Washington marks a tightening pace in the Russian investigation.
Sources say Mueller wanted a large jury to help investigate Russia’s interference in the U.S. presidential election and whether Trump’s campaign or his close circles were cooperating with Russia.
The Grand Jury expands Mueller’s rights to gather evidence, send challenges, and force people to testify under oath.
The Great Jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The grand jury will weigh the evidence obtained by the prosecutor during the investigation and decide whether the charges should be brought.
British Inventor Microchiped Himself To Get To His Home And Car With Handshake
The British inventor is the first in the country to micro-route himself so that he can open the outside door of his home, get into his office and start his car with a swing of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and front finger of 33-year-old Steven Northam. Now he provides a service to and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of the Northam BioTeq company.
Northam is partnering with Geoff Watson, anesthetic consultant at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure that the microchip is installed to meet medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technology as the microchip for cats and dogs, and it only takes 30 seconds to install.
The company of Northam also transforms the locks of houses and cars to be compatible with the microchip. The one-lock processing costs £300.
Northam is married and has one child.He has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
White House exhibition cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House’s decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the White House’s southern lawn for an event showcasing American production came to cost taxpayers $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is referred to as Marine One when the President is on board it. It was an attraction at the White House event on July 17, 2017 to showcase American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials visited the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the Connecticut-made helicopter, the exhibits included a sailing boat from Maine, a fire car from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.
The White House military office had requested the helicopter to take place on a mission-specific order only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn for an “exceptional” event.
“I just wanted to make sure you are aware of this because this is an extraordinary event that gets a lot of visibility,” the commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote in an email to his commander, an assistant commander of the Naval Air Force.
In the message it was that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn at 7 a.m. on 17 July and the event would begin at 3 p.m. The helicopter would not leave the site until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. on the evening.
In addition, the message said that if the departure of the helicopter from the White House was delayed, another crew would be needed to arrive due to service time limitations.
The original crew was in the helicopter at the time of the incident, and the unit’s security staff was at the helicopter while it was on the ground.
The documents obtained by TIME do not show whether another crew was needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to documents, HMX-1 was questioning whether the incident violated the law.
“One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told not to violate,” the commander wrote.
“It sounds like you can participate,” the deputy commander replied.
Made in America was an official White House event, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even the official events have political tones.
During the event, the president spoke in favour of the health care reform that was being debated in the Senate at the time, as well as looser state regulation.
The use of Marine One helicopters and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their journeys,
But their use only for photographs is unusual.
Trump’s actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the backdrop of a presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized his predecessor’s use of the presidential plane on Twitter.
“The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which showcased products made from American materials by American workers from all 50 states,” said Lindsay Walters, White House press secretary.
The crew of the HMX-1 unit regularly performs training flights in the Washington area and train on the southern lawn to bring the president to the White House with a precision of centimeters.
While Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, flights to the Made in America event were part of the crew’s monthly training quota.
The helicopters of the unit also flew 11 hours on “non-presidential support missions” that day.
The White House said there were no additional costs for taxpayers.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration on the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have records of flights related to presidential duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the event.
According to the Defense Ministry’s 2017 hourly compensation, the VH-3D helicopter’s compensation level is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from Quantico base in Virginia to the White House and back took a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of operating the helicopter is significantly lower.
“Calculating the costs incurred by taxpayers by the level of compensation is misleading,” Walters says.
“The estimated level of reimbursement includes personnel, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs that will be taken into account in the annual appropriations.”
According to a 2015 survey by the RAND research company, the compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
“The idea is to introduce American production,” Spicer said.
“I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and thus employing probably hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopters and other weapons for which many Americans have worked hard.
It is perfectly appropriate to point out this.”
It is unclear whether Trump was on the helicopter during the incident, but at least he sat in the fire truck driver’s seat.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said, “I have three.”
Lightning hits Vaasan railroad – trains will have to be replaced by buses
Passenger train traffic between Seinäjoen and Vasa has been cut off due to a technical defect, the Rail Traffic Centre reports.
Trains will be replaced by buses.
A failure in the traffic control system caused a storm.
There was no estimate of the duration of the repair this morning.
Venezuelan prosecutor demands the right to block the appointment of a new representative
The Venezuelan prosecutor has requested a court ruling to block the appointment of a new representative of the country.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the elected representative will be appointed on Friday.
In the controversial vote, a delegation was elected for the country, which can, among other things, amend the country’s constitution.
Prosecutor-in-Chief Luisa Ortega said the decision was requested because of suspicions of electoral fraud.
Ortega has also launched an investigation into electoral fraud.
He appointed two judges after a British company organizing the representative vote said the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters by the Venezuelan authorities was about a million more than the number of actual voters.
Maduro’s 545-member parliament has been elected, including his wife and son.
In addition to amending the Constitution, the House of Representatives can dissolve the opposition-led Congress and amend laws.
Maduro is a dictator
Maduro’s actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the reform of the constitution as a means for Maduro to strengthen his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro, calling him a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have said they will not recognize the new delegation.
Maduro says the new delegation is a solution to the country’s political and economic crisis.
Unrest in Venezuela has been ongoing for months.
Many people were injured and more than a hundred were killed.
Venezuela has fallen into an economic crisis following the fall in oil prices.
Nowadays, many people do not have access to food or medicines.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when a new parliamentary session is scheduled.
Russian man extradited to Finland sentenced to four years in prison in the US
A U.S. court in Minneapolis on Thursday sentenced 41-year-old Maxim Senah to four years in prison for involvement in global computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 following a request from the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
The Finnish border guards arrested him as he was heading home.
Finland extradited Senah to U.S. justice in February 2016, despite Russian objections.
He was found guilty in March of this year of a computer fraud that had earned millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
The U.S. Department of Justice says Senah will be expelled from the country after serving a prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry criticized Finland after the arrest and said the man should not be extradited to the United States.
The statement accused Finland and the United States that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
The prosecutor said Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury to infect tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to hack usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the data to further direct internet traffic, making click scams and spreading spam.
Justice Department Chief Criminal Officer Kenneth Blanco said the case shows that the U.S. is capable of chasing other cybercriminals as well.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice,” Blanco said in a statement.
Modified at 8.58: Correction of the sentenced person's name.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Pablo Escobar Is Out of the Scenes, So The Cali Cartel Rises to the Main Role in Netflix's Hits Series
Although Pablo Escobar’s killer was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the series will feature a third and fourth season. The trailer for the third season has been announced, and it will showcase the new scams of the series.
In the third season, the U.S. Drug Police DEA has turned its attention to the Cali Cartel, the world’s wealthiest drug trafficking organization.

Kari Kola performs exceptional light art work in Paris
The light artist Kari Kola (pictured) will perform an exceptional light art work in honor of the first Day of Light established by the United Nations in Paris on May 16 next year.
Kola is making a light art work in Paris called Day and Night.
The theme of the work is light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the Fontenoy building of the UNESCO headquarters and the Globe monument in front of it.
I want to emphasize not only the light but also the darkness.
Today, light pollution in millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can raise the things I have experienced as important to concrete visibility, says light artist Kari Kola in his work.
I am well received from the invitation to participate in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art into the theme day.
Kari Kola participated in the opening ceremony of the Year of Light in 2015, when he illuminated the UNESCO headquarters in honor of the celebration.
I feel very privileged to be able to bring my art back to the UNESCO headquarters,” says Kari Kola.
The work may be expanded significantly.
This will be announced later in the coming year, the company said.
The purpose of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light for humanity and to raise awareness in the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated in the UNESCO headquarters in Paris on May 16.
Two men fought in a shopping mall in Espoo
A dispute between two men arose in the parking hall of the shopping center in Esbo on Wednesday morning.
The dispute arose when the other party accidentally drove in a forbidden direction.
There was a struggle between the drivers.
The driver who drove in the forbidden direction would fool the driver of another car, as a result of which this car started to crash into the car of the attacker.
After that, he struck a crashing car.
In a preliminary speech, the man has admitted that he has caused harm and wrongdoing.
From Timo Soin with a question mark entitled: "Then came the flood"
On Thursday, Foreign Minister Timo Soini published a blog post titled with a question mark.
The text is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to a government party of thirty-seven parliamentarians.
Then came the flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
The text of Soini refers to France in the 17th century.
King Louis XV, or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, is known to have used the flood comparison.
Depending on the interpretation, the historical books have left the statements "the flood after us" or "the flood after me".
The United Nations says Afghanistan’s democracy depends on women’s political role
The elections will be representative only if all members of society, including women, can vote, the head of the UN embassy in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, Interim Director of the United Nations Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women are running for council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
“Women’s role cannot be stressed too much,” Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all aspects of the electoral process.
Afghanistan’s provincial council and presidential elections will be held on April 5, 2017.
The Taliban has raised threats about the elections at the same time as international forces are shifting to an advisory role.
This year’s elections are the first time that power is passed peacefully from a democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women’s contribution will strengthen Afghanistan’s democracy.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

The flood of certain types of tourists a threat to the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The local population is angry at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it “eat and flee” tourism: you are only a few hours away and rush through the sights in large crowds.
Venice is overwhelmed by quick day trips to the city for tourists.
The narrow streets are difficult to move around and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer accommodate them.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic centre, while houses have been replaced by hotels.
About the problems brought by tourism in Venice writes The New York Times and The Guardian.
The authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism.
Upon arrival on a large cruise ship, the time is given for two or three hours.
Following a guide holding a ticket from Piazzale Rome to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and turning back, Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini describes the prevailing and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities lies not only in the architecture, but also in the operation of the site, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of the cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular sights of the historic centre of Venice.
On the edge of the tower is the church of St. Mark.
Also, the anger of locals is mainly directed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 people live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians demonstrated against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has undermined their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives residents away.
Approximately 2,000 people leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be only tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical catastrophe,” said Carlo Belframe, who organized the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as the ships bring to Venice the much-needed income and create the need for numerous jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution has been planned to make cruisers go further away from the historic center.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, said the situation would change if the administrative region of Venice, where Venice is located, had more power to decide its own affairs – if not full autonomy.
Approximately 20-30 million tourists visit Venice each year.

Kilometre-long traffic on the highway
On the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, which goes north, there have been kilometers of congestion from Thursday afternoon to the time of the return traffic.
In the area, highway coating is being carried out, which slows down traffic, Savon Sanomat says.
The speed limit is 50 km/h instead of the usual 120 km/h.
Even in the 50 km restricted area, traffic had advanced on Thursday afternoon, but in some places it was practically walking speed.
The work progressed on Thursday afternoon on the side of the Siilinjärvi on the Statue of the Apocalypse, i.e. the golden oat.
I can do well without that attention.
The 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curse of the public.
Amalie Iuel has published stunning photos of herself in the landscapes of the Grand Canyon, among others.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has grown into a popular athlete in her present home country Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400-meter run in March by completing a runtime of 51.81.
A month later, he improved the Norwegian record at 55.38.
Iuel, who worked hard on social media, soon discovered that celebrity and publicity had their shadow sides.
Men around the world began sending Iui images of their genitals, apparently in the hope that a young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to shut down his Snapchat account.
“I got a lot of ‘black photos’ from unknown people, so I was forced to make my account private,” Iuel told VG.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to specify exactly what kind of pictures he got.
You might guess, Iuel laughed.
It’s nice to get feedback after the run, but I can do well without such a different kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish and his father is Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalien was 2 years old.
When Amalien was 12 years old, his family moved to Pakistan and Namibia for his father’s work.
Then came Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed his Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
We are much more open to discussions in Norway than in the United States.
In the United States, coaches don’t ask anything, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal with the athlete personally, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the Norwegian record in 400 metres and 400 metres.
A foot injury took snowboarder Janne Korve on the balance of his entire career - now participating in the World Cup: "It's nice not to hurt anything"
It was nice to count when nothing happened.
Janne Korpi, 31, one of the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has once again been able to truly enjoy her beloved species.
Last summer, his career was at stake.
He was injured by an injury to his leg in January and his leg didn’t want to heal.
He had also been hit in the race.
In the summer, I didn’t know what I was going to do, whether it was going to continue or not.
Sponsorships were closed and a lot of things open, Corpi says.
It is said that things usually go well.
The leg healed, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and the blood began to pull into the slope again.
The decision was then easy.
I knew it when I first walked in the snow.
I thought it was so funny, so let’s go a couple more.
The body did not get down properly until September-October, but after a long drop-off, just painless training has been a big deal.
There were only a few tournaments.
It does not matter.
Competition has never been the most important aspect of Corvette’s table.
I have never counted for a race.
I think it’s frustrating to aim for four years in one race, and then you’re having a fever that week.
I can’t think so, the body says.
This year’s World Cup will be held in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though individual matches don’t keep him on the table, in a tough team of racing he always lights up.
According to Korvi, the prestige of the competitions organized by the International Ski Union has grown over the past few years, even though some board players chose the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
This is a big game and the visibility is great.
However, it always depends on the conditions and the level of the competition.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the Finnish 12-member team in Sierra Nevada.
The teammates, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It’s nice to see younger friends.
I remember when I myself was at that point that everything was new and was so sick excited about everything.
It also brings a new flow, the Corpi thinks.
I’m still in the hillside somehow, but otherwise not, that’s the flow in the guys!
In the background of his running career, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of director legend Pekka Korve has been attached to ravior sport: the ravior has his own ravior horses for which he makes training programs.
When I’m traveling all the time, I don’t have time to be in the mess anymore.
But every day I look at at least the nutritional results and usually something starting out, Korpi says.
According to Korve, plowing and nutrition training are a potential career plan when the plowing career comes to an end.
I’m not planning so far, but at least that’s a possible option.
I feel it a little like studying it alongside snowboarding.
I try to stay nervous and develop, maybe in the summer I’ll start something.
If it’s my future profession, then it’s not hard to start it when you’re already in the field.
Among them is also the Elitloppet cruise organized with the conductor Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have hired a cruise ship that will head to Stockholm in late May for the Elitloppet food competition.
The towns and towns decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has gone well for sale, and people have been excited.
At the moment, it is clear that there will be no bankruptcy.
There are still a few months to go, hopefully we can get the ship full, Korpi says excited.
Attendee’s home care project has surprised everyone.
Attendo Esteri is the name of the new 41-seat home for the elderly who will be built on Kite.
The 1,700-storey building will be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre’s neighboring Healthy Road.
A common topic of wonder is what new care unit will be enough for customers, because now during the Siu war many private care homes are suffering from a customer shortage.
Anne Flink, Regional Director of Care Services from Attendola, commented that Kite will have increased demand in the future not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, says Flink.
Attendo bought the private care homes Kanervikkola and Eerikan from Kite last year.
The deal concerned business, but the property is known to have a five-year lease agreement.
Flink says Attendo does not have an acute need to move functions away from these spaces.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about McVitie’s continued operation in Scotland
The trade union is seeking confirmation from McVitie’s executives for their long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to GMB’s Scottish branch, the company has not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products factory has more than 500 employees.
Pladis, the company that owns the McVitie’s brand, said it has invested more than £5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives “will be told first” if there are changes in their activities.
In a letter to the head of the factory, GMB urged the company “to address concerns about the lack of funding for the modernization of the production lines.”
GMB trade union Drew Duffy is deeply concerned that the factory manager is not clearly informed about Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plans.
“Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and the metropolitan area of Glasgow.
In terms of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as Brexit, rising living costs and a continuing decline in production, East Glasgow is in great need of a thriving McVitie’s production.”
According to a spokesman for Pladis, the factory director had received the letter from the trade union only the day before and the company is responding directly to the letter because it appreciates continued interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
“We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, where we openly discussed a number of issues.
We discussed with our employees, among other things, that like other companies in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we are constantly evaluating all of our business operations and locations in order to remain competitive.”
In recent years, the company has invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant, in its production lines and operations improvement.
“We are aware of Tollcross’s long history as a production plant and we will be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we plan to make changes to the operation of the factory.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain won't give up on Neymar's pursuit after paying £189 million to terminate the transfer deal. But did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational move is the most talked case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record of transfer amounts. The previous record was less than half smaller: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a £89 million transfer.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive footballer and also the world’s best-paid professional athlete, as PSG offers him a weekly salary of over £500,000 after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be angry at the actions of PSG and the way Neymar has forcibly left the club. a source close to Barcelona says that the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived at Santos in 2013.
Did the president of PSG warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned clubs seeking PSG’s best players.
“I’m not worried, because they know that if they squat our players, we’ll become their opponents and we’ll contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they struggle with our players, they will face the consequences.”
Barcelona appears to have done just this: it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratto earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances.

Trump’s phone calls were invented – White House spokesman: “I’t say it was a lie”
The White House has admitted that the two calls mentioned by U.S. President Donald Trump never happened, according to the New York Times.
Trump’s smoked calls with both the Mexican president and the leader of the patrol organization have proven to be inventive.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had taken place.
He said Trump was not lying.
According to Sanders, many of the patrons’ leaders spoke to Trump in person, and with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump had talked at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
I’t say it was a lie, it’s a tough accusation.
“These conversations took place, not just on the phone, but face-to-face,” Sanders said.
The speech to the parliamentarians caused outrage.
Trump said on Monday that the Mexican president had called him and praised him for his successful efforts to curb illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few will cross the southern border with Mexico anymore because they know that the trip will eventually lead to the U.S. border.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government issued a statement stating that no such call had taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico released a full version of Trump’s interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Trump spoke at a meeting of the National Patrol Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the scouts, he said it was the most beautiful speech ever given to them.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, the agency said it was unaware of any of its leaders’ calls to Trump.
According to the statement, Michael Surbaugh’s previous statement, in which he apologized to the patrons for Trump’s speech, speaks for itself.
Trump’s speech at a gathering of patrons caused a lot of wonder, as it was exceptionally political in terms of the nature of the event.
He also criticized the results of last autumn’s presidential elections.
