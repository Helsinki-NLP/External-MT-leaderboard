Welsh AM and have the annoyance for you as a toy
There is a concern among some AMs for the consideration that their name should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It began with a plan to change the name of the county to the Welsh Assembly.
AMs across all political spectrums are concerned that it may lead to abuse.
The Labour Party's AM said its members were concerned that it was falling into the Twp and Pwp.
For fighters outside Wales: In Welsh twp means stupid, pwp means poison.
AM Yi Su An An An says that the same as the whole an anger, and it has other comparisons.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but said it was a short-lived move from the MWP to the Sporting Goods.
In this sense the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same way as the Yorkshire English letter u.
The Commission of the National Convention, drafting the bill to introduce the name change, stated: The final decision and any interpretation of the term Members of the National Convention will be a matter for the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Plan 2017 authorised the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the objectives which found widespread support for the convening of a national assembly called the Welsh Assembly.
In terms of the name of the AMs, the Commission fell to the Welsh Assembly Members or WMPs, but the MWP nomination received the most support from public consultation.
The AMs are offering other options, of course, but the battle to reach an agreement could be a painful one for Chief Operating Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to hand over the draft rules for the changes in the coming weeks.
The proposed amendments would include further changes to the way the national convention operates, including rules for the identification of AMs and the architecture of the system.
The AMs will have a final vote on the question of what they should be called when they have voted on the bill.
Macedonians will go to the polls to change the name of their country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A referendum was called to resolve a long-running dispute between neighboring Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia.
Athens has long recognised that the name of its northern neighbours and the perceived hostility to its territory, have further undermined its membership bids for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum and the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the nomination, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say corruption and the name change is the only price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bell is Silent as Harlem's Churchers Fight for the Nation
"In the past, the elders I spoke to said that there were bars and churches everywhere", Mr. Adams said.
Today, there is none.
He said that he understood the absence of the bars.
"People are coming together in different ways now", he said.
A bar is no longer a private room where people go regularly.
For the church members, it is worrying that the money raised from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders think, but sooner or later they will return to where they started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by large buildings with a larger population that would not contribute to the sanctity of the rest of the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people buying apartments in these houses will be white, he said, so they will have to wait for the day when the churches will be completely closed because it will be difficult to get the majority of people to move into these houses to become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black community - the City Hall in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The first Methodist congregations were formed in 1930.
Six black congregations that worshiped nearby took over the building.
Black congregations took over St. Martin under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a protest by merchants on Route 125, the main shopping street in Harlem, who were opposed to the hiring or promotion of blacks in the market.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as the church's Father Johnson's congregation planned to rebuild the building, they built the bell tower.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, enthusiastically called the bell the "bell of the poor".
The engineer who installed the bell in July valued it another way: Cultural heritage as well as historical equipment cannot be replaced.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the world's first bell to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had visited the larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin was not in his presence.
What was said in St. Martin over the last few months is a story of a mix of artists and architects, some of whom were introduced by the leadership of the church, others by the department of the church under the control of the Bishops.
The board - the church's administrative body, which is filled with leaders - wrote to the church department in July for the idea that the church department would be willing to transfer the bills to the general building, even if the general building did not participate in hiring the designers and architects the church department had sent.
Some church members blamed the lack of revelation on the church division.
13-year-old injured by shark in California lobster shark attack
A shark sank and injured the 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was forcing water for a lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The drowning occurred just before 7 a.m. along the Beacon River in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and friends were forced into the water for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, then he and some others got in a boat to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was a novelty to catch lobsters, but then he realized that it was a joke, and I got it!
I was wrong!'
With all his bones broken,  Hammel said he knew as soon as he reached the boy.
I shouted for everyone to come out of the water: There is a shark in the water! Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said the editor had seen the shark in the area a few weeks ago, but determined it was not a bad shark.
Giles added that the victim had extensive injuries to the upper part of his body.
Authorities closed the river from Ponto River Bridge in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas within 48 hours for research and safety purposes.
Giles also said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not found to be bad.
Sainbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainbury is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by using a beauty line with a craft-store staffed by expert assistants.
As part of a £2.8m investment in the UK cosmetics market, which continues to grow in the fashion and home furnishings sector in return, the cosmetics line will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and rolled out to other stores next year if successful.
The cost of cosmetics is coming to stores and retailers to fill the gap that was originally created for televisions, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would expand its cosmetics product line to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and the original Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands starting with L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive slots and zones with brands similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The stores are re-launching their store so that the majority of the products are not harmful to animals - something that customers are now growing and demanding.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will trial licensing in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and commuting to and from small grocery stores in the area mean that supermarkets have more work to do to attract people.
Mike Coupe, the CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that the small store will continue to be the same size as the supermarket while the department store is trying to re-capitalize Aldi and Lidl by adding more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's is adding the small Argos store to several stores, and has brought in a number of Habitats stores since it bought the two companies two years ago, which it says increased food sales and increased the brand's profits.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to start up a search and sale of pharmaceuticals failed.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger was terminated after a dispute over how to share profits from the drugstore chain with its major retailers.
The new rules come after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmacy stores to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125m, three years ago.
He said Lloyds would work on the plan, by adding the shares of well-known skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to the four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's marketing director, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetic products to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialised staff who will be available immediately to provide advice.
Our brand size is designed to fit all needs, aesthetic surroundings and good atmosphere means that we promote a cosmetic space that stands out among the traditional shopping streets.
The company owes Peter Jones as Holly Willoughby withdrew from the £11million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was furious as TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of her £11million contract with the lifestyle business to focus on her new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby had no time for their home furnishings and equipment store Truly.
The two businesses are listed on Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Market.
The This Morning presenter, 37, took to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' Peter Jones infamously by jumping out of their successful live-action business in the last few months - to focus on her new highly-acclaimed contract between Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was reportedly angered when the much-loved TV girl admitted during a protest on Tuesday at the headquarters of her department store in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contract - worth £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to focus on her home-wear and accessories business Truly.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop sale, and was predicted to double Willoughby's estimated fortune to £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain to go to his private retreat.
A headline read: "Truly the most important thing for Holly.
It should be his future in hand that will take care of him for the next ten years.
His decision to leave everyone behind contributed to the conflict.
No one can be sure what is going on on Tuesday, it came very close to the beginning.
There is a warehouse full of products located at Marlow Headquarters that is ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning broadcaster, who is one of Britain's most prominent fundraisers, could cost the store millions due to a large influx of money and products from chairs and candles to furniture and clothing, with the possibility of another early execution.
It may be the end of the long haul.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin had been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for about ten years.
Willoughby and Capp launched Truly in 2016, with Jones, 52, joining as executive director in March.
The couple share the pension funds, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV broadcasting company.
Willoughby will be the company's representative for M&S, and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A person close to Jones said last night We are not allowed to talk about his business.
Strong words then we love each other
He has been ridiculed for the criticism he would receive from the media for making some remarks that would be considered "un-presidential" and for having a genuine belief in the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so forgiving?
Trump said in a press conference that he would not be pressured.
I have left nothing behind.
He also said Kim was keen on a second summit after their first meeting in Singapore in June which Trump hailed as a major step in denuclearising North Korea.
But the talks on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "commensurate response" from the U.S. to North Korea's disarmament and demining operations.
Instead, he added, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions designed to contain fires.
Trump followed the good faith approach in his closing remarks.
"We are doing great in North Korea", he said.
We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
Millions of lives are at stake.
Now we have a big piggy bank
He said his efforts to improve relations between Kim and Kim's family had produced positive results - halting rocket tests, helping to free prisoners and returning remains and dead American soldiers.
He also defended his different approach to the allegations against Kim.
"It's very easy to play the president, but instead of pretending that 10,000 people are trying to get into a crowded place, we have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in his face.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Damages and Kills
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign journalists were told that they were not wanted by the government.
Even though more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced from their homes, no national disaster has been declared, a first for seeking international aid.
"Mostly, and sadly, they made it clear that they don't want any foreign aid, so it's a challenge", said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is booking a team to Palu, it is unclear whether international staff will be able to work in the country.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were monitoring the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies would be allowed to assist in the relief effort.
Indonesia is prone to earthquakes and has a constant, the country is not prepared for the impact of earthquakes.
While a tsunami watchtower was built in Aceh, it is not common on other beaches.
A tsunami warning signal that is not present in Palu, even if the warning is delayed, can contribute to the loss of life.
In the best of times, traveling between most of Indonesia's islands is a challenge.
National disasters add to the complexity of the organization.
Hospital boats set up in Lombok to treat earthquake victims are now heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo's attempt to modernize Indonesia's infrastructure was the subject of his election campaign, but he has already lost money on roads and railways.
But there is no money and the administration of Mr Joko is running as he is seeking re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also defends the pressure of long-standing sectarian strife in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a form of protectionism.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes as Christian and Muslim mobs engaged in street fighting, using knives, bows and spears, and other weapons of mass destruction.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge's reply in the final against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League defeat by Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute in Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was 30 yards outside the Chelsea goal as his team were trailing 1-0.
He put the ball in his left hand before he shot at the top of the post.
The bait moves over the basket as it sweeps over the top of the net.
The ball eventually passed Kepa Arrizabalaga with a hand out and landed in the net.
"It's about trying to get in the situation, to catch the ball and players like Shaq and his bat are always going to go forward as much as possible, so I myself tried to get myself out as much as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
 I saw Kante coming, touched him once, didn't think much about it, shot him immediately.
Chelsea led 1-0 after going to rest after a goal in the 25th minute by Eden Hazard of Belgium.
The Blues forward gave Mateo Kovacic a leg back pass in the game, before running across the halfway line and hitting a Liverpool half.
Kovacic made a fast break in the semi-final.
He hit a perfect game, which sent Hazard into the box.
Hazard crossed the line and put the goal in the back of the net with a left-footed shot and passed Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool and Napoli will face each other in the first leg of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are facing Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Death toll from the Indonesian tsunami reaches 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has reached 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped under collapsed buildings caused by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit on Friday and triggered a 20-foot-high wave, the agency spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, was littered with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man in an investigation of the stabbing of a woman
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhard, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55am with a knife wound in Grayson Mews on John Road, a 32-year-old man was arrested in a murder investigation.
Police are asking people in the area to report if they see or hear anything.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: The investigation is in its early stages but I would ask anyone in the John Road area of Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who can catch anything with dashcam cameras to contact us as they may have information that is important for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman's body was found in a local quarry in Birkenhead.
This afternoon friends believe that the woman has come to the camp to ask about where she was seen this morning.
An investigation is currently underway as the police are preparing to inform the deputy of the perpetrator.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mew tried to lock himself in but the police told him no one was entering or leaving the building.
He was shocked to discover what had happened.
Residents are now being told that it will be a long time before they are allowed to re-enter.
A policeman was heard telling a man that the whole area was seen as a crime camp.
A woman came to the camp crying.
He was talking and he was bad.
At 2 p.m. two police cars were inside the line and another outside.
Some policemen stood in the line and watched the houses.
Anyone with information is requested to write to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and call record 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell statue of the Parliament has been the latest monument to the debate over rewriting history.
His expulsion was to be punishment for his Taliban-like damage to England's cultural and religious fabric, inflicted by the troublesome Puritan followers.
But one Cromwell described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "a joke" and "a rewrite of the old story".
John Goldsmith, the chairman of the Cromwell Group, said: "It is unlikely that the current debate over the removal of the statue and monument of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will be the focus.
The desecration of religious symbols during the English wars was neither ordered by Cromwell nor his doing.
Perhaps Cromwell will be unjustly executed for the crime of his grandfather Thomas committed a century ago.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's brilliant portrayal of Cromwell was a mistake in 19th century thought and part of a humanist narrative that many believed deserved to be exalted.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: Many have praised Cromwell, perhaps more in the late 19th century than at this time, as the protector of Parliament for outside influence, in his political speeches.
But that exact definition is also the subject of an old and ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the struggles of the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was a man of such prominence that he represents one side of that divide.
His rise as the Supreme Protector is something to be celebrated and remembered.
Chinese Farmer Killed by a Squirrel
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in the western and southern parts of China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname Yaun, was found dead, his body torn apart, covered in blood near the pigs' market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A farmer and pig farmer administered a vaccine to pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
He and his nephew are said to have started a journey in Yunnan province near Wenesde to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his nephew found her dead and found a way into a room that was unlocked.
He said inside the pig was a big pig with blood in its mouth.
Forensics concluded that the 550 pigs had fallen on the farmer, according to the report.
"My nephew's feet are covered with blood and wounds", said the nephew, who used his last name to refer to his father's name, "Wu", according to Guiyan Evening News.
Surveillance footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Tuesday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yaun's or his nephew's.
A sales manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from hugging anyone else, while police were gathering handcuffs in the yard.
The Yuan family and the business community are in mourning over his death.
Although rare, a genuine embrace is a matter of record.
In 2016, a pig stabbed a pregnant woman in her backyard in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, 650 pigs piled on a Welsh farmer's tractor until his wife chased the animals away.
After a pig was killed by an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Mantiba farmer told CNC News that the pig was often violent but the taste of blood could be a trigger.
They are only afraid to speak.
They are small, they have great desires ... they cannot harm you.
You should give it the right respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause a large rainfall spread across the southwestern US.
As forecasts say, Hurricane Rosa is poised to pass over the frigid waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains that will cause flooding across northern Mexico and the western and southern parts of the U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. Eastern Sunday, located 385 miles west-southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Expect Rosa to head north on Sunday.
Now, a large gap has begun to accumulate across the Pacific Ocean and eastward toward the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa reaches the Baja California coast on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep water north into the western and southern U.S.
Rosa will be carrying up to 10 inches of rain across Mexico on Monday.
Then, the rainfall mixes into a large hole and the rain will create a large rainfall that will spread west and south over the next few days.
In the region, a 1 to 4 inches of freezing rain will lead to severe flooding, wetlands and potentially deserted wetlands.
Deep flooding will result in heavy rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in some areas, mostly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As 2 to 4 inches of rainfall is expected in some parts of the West and south, especially across Arizona.
There may be flooding with damaging conditions due to the nature of the storm surge.
It would be a very bad idea to go into the desert on foot where there is a risk of storms.
Heavy rainfall can turn the canyon into a raging river with thunderstorms and tornadoes leading to hurricanes and sandstorms.
The approaching Great Rift will bring some heavy rains to the Southern California coast.
Concentrations of more than half an inch of water can occur, which can cause minor sweating as well as traffic jams and mudslides.
This would be the first rain of the region's rainy season.
Some of the storms that have been affected will begin to reach Arizona on Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the storms dissipate on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy snowfall will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue till Wednesday.
October could see some strong temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics will be warmer.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in templates over a short period of time.
There was a huge gap in the extreme temperature difference between the U.S. and Saturday.
There are temperature differences of up to 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the continuing heat of the dry season will try to cool down and rise again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see early October with temperatures in the 80s from the South to the East and north.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecasts indicate a high probability for the above-average temperatures for the eastern part of the U.S. to exceed the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's performance
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accused of raping Christine Blasey Ford in the 1980s, on the cable television network.
Now that the political impasse has been resolved, the media are in the midst of a series of events that should have been a last-minute twist on Friday: the proposed settlement of Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona's deal for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the House Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had punched him in the face with a drunken eye and tried to rob him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a highly emotional statement, said he was 100 percent sure he didn't.
There is a chance that more than 20.4 million people watched the episode that Nielsen reported on Friday.
The channel counts the average views on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that aired it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
But Nielsen often had trouble matching viewers in his studio.
To put that in perspective, that's the size of the samples that are in the winner's football team or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose conservative editors strongly endorsed Kavanaugh's nomination, surpassed all networks by having an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day countdown, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million subscribers, NBC has 2.94 million subscribers, MSNBC has 2.89 million subscribers and CNN has 2.52 million subscribers, Nielsen said.
The interest increased as the lecture ended.
Flake was a firm believer in the Friday message.
As the Republican National Committee released its statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him early Friday morning as angry protesters hated him as he tried to enter the Senate floor.
He modestly stood for several minutes as the abuse was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
DO YOU feel that he is speaking truth to our people?
She was told, "You have the power when most women don't have the power".
Flake said that his company had already issued a statement and said that, before the elevator closed, he would have more to say at the end of the convention.
Cable networks and the media were covering the immediate aftermath, when the Judiciary Committee should vote to move Kavanaugh's nomination by the General Assembly for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only on the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the nominee in the weeks ahead, which the Democrats in the minority are holding.
Flake's heart was changed a little bit in a conversation with his friend, Democratic Congressman Chris Coons.
After the Coons's plot, and after several lawmakers, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was justified, because it implied that Republicans had no vote to support Kavanaugh and did not do the poll.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May and critics accused of 'politicising' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of using Britain's future to lobby for her plan to leave the European Union and to undermine the country's interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview in his own section of the paper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson laid out his opposition to his Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the idea that Britain and the EU should collect taxes from each other was "big nonsense".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest a suspect in connection with Dyteon Simpson and the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and booked on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police returned the glasses to the circle and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB said.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he believed in shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, Advocate said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department thanks the efforts of the Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and local citizens who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU coach Joe Alleva thanked the police for uchu and for following his son.
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also an LSU basketball player.
He averaged 5.6 points per game and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "in shock" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you're thinking all the time", Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash in Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern plains of the Mexican mainland.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano as activity was detected in the crater, which recorded 183 gas and dust explosions over a 24-hour period.
The station monitors many sounds and earthquakes.
Images of public latrines showed small ash heaps covering cars in Mexico City's neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have detected the origin and formation of the volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) east-southwest of the mainland since the 7.1 earthquake that hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano has been known as Don Goyo since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists clashed before independence day
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday as pro-independence protesters attacked police, as thousands of people joined another protest to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's independence vote and the rally.
One of the separatists covered their faces with police and checkpoints and covered them with blankets and lay ashes, creating a black cloud of dust on the roads and often crowded with passers-by.
Later that day a fight broke out where the police used sticks to break up the fight.
For many hours the freedom fighters were on the streets Never forget, never forgive in the face of the unity protesters, Long live Spain.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protest, local media reported.
The regional uprising in favor of independence a year after the October 1 Madrid elections saw the defeat of the secessionist Catalonia.
Voters voted unanimously for independence, although the results were slightly lower than those of the anti-secessionist faction.
With Catalan authorities claiming that up to 1000 people were injured last year as police tried to stop the elections from taking place in polling stations across the region in the wake of the mass clashes.
Freedom groups worked on Tuesday and Friday to prevent protests with the support of the national police.
The protest continued but they were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's prospect of independence.
Last year we witnessed one of the best moments of our lives.
I watched my parents cry for the opportunity to vote but now we are in a bind", he said.
Despite a narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the pro-Catalonia movement has tried to keep up momentum this year as many of its most prominent leaders have fled or are in jail awaiting trial for their role in organising the elections and the subsequent independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old auto mechanic who recorded the protest on his cell phone with the support of the police, said that the protesters on both sides instigated the conflict.
He said people's hearts are too fast,
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the leaders of Catalonia who has been in prison awaiting trial since late last year, announced that he would stand for the European Parliament elections.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way to undo the backsliding in the democratic process and the repression we have seen in the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashed into house
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, have been arrested for repeated carjacking in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the door was damaged as well as the building itself.
Perhaps the car was damaged at one point.
The goal gave Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers.
The first goal by Dolly Menga of Livingston brought victory
Livingston's move stunned Rangers to add Steven Gerrard to his second spell in 18 games as captain of the Ibrox team.
Dolly Menga's goal stood as the Gary Holt team moved up one level to Hibernia in the second round.
Gerrard's team and unbeaten in the Premiership this year will meet the leading Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will meet Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, extended their winless streak in the division to six games, while captain Holt has not had a loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost their chance to the outsiders and the sloth
Holt's team should be in the lead before they score, their tough game has caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson passed but missed his attempt in front of goal, then Alan Lithgow made a stronger attempt to get the head ball passed by Craig Halkett in front of goal.
The four players were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, hoping that they would give the visitors a problem with the ball being in the same spot.
But that was their way of giving the important goal.
Rangers gave a frisky, Livingston opened the scoring, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to raise Menga, who touched him once and scored from the middle of the basket.
At that time, the Rangers had all the ball but they could not get past the four defenders and the post guard Liam Kelly was no problem,
The sequence continued into the second half, but Alfredo Morelos let Kelly do his part.
Lithgow missed the leg of Rangers post keeper Allan McGregor's Scott Pittman, and Livingston again missed the ball with a single.
The ball came repeatedly into Livingston's basket, which was all missed, while there were two penalties for refusing - after Halkett had kicked Glenn Middleton, one for touching the ball - refused.
The terrible thing by Livingston - a compilation
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland and the Tony Macaroni Garden
The consequences were terrible for Livingston.
In one man's opinion, they did well, and they continued to exceed their expectations and expectations.
The team's form and players have not changed much since their return to the top, but credit should go to Holt for the way he has managed the team since his arrival.
It has many thorns.
Captain Halkett was very aggressive and defensive, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall out of the game.
The Rangers have nothing to start with.
Even the best team under Gerrard fell short of those standards.
Their last ball was not enough - only once they opened the home team, it was a victory for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a wide welcome in Cologne
With laughter and a sky of green (September 29) the Turkish and German presidents met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's diplomatic and diplomatic excursion to Germany - which was intended to resolve relations between NATO allies.
They have been at odds over issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a new mosque that was enormous.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police used security measures to prevent the crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came out from nearby to meet their president.
Hundreds of people who do not support Erdogan - mostly Kurdish - also raised their voices, expressing their disgust at Erdogan's policy and the German decision to accept him into the country.
The protest was a sign of division that some Turks from Germany called a monster while others saw him as a dictator.
Deptford road accident: A cyclist dies in an accident with a car
A cyclist died in an accident involving a car in London.
The accident happened at the intersection of Bestwood Road and Evelyn Road, a congested highway in Deptford, east and south of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped, the caretakers checked him out, but the man died on the spot.
The accident happened within months of another cyclist dying in a hit-and-run accident on the Childers Highway, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that the police were working to identify the man and inform the next person.
Road closures and heavy traffic are in place, please advise drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six workers injured in riot
Six prison staff have been injured in clashes in the men's maximum security prison, the Prison Service said.
A riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday which is still ongoing.
The Tornado specialists were brought in to deal with the mess, which included eight prisoners, and were grouped in one area.
The workers were treated for minor injuries to their faces there.
The spokesperson of the Prison Service said: Send special prison officers to deal with the current situation in HMP Long Lartin.
Do not treat six people for injuries.
We do not tolerate riots in our prison, and those who cause them are usually handed over to the police, who may spend longer in prison.
HMP Long Lartin is used by over 500 prisoners, including some of the city's worst criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison governor had received medical treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
Last October workers went on strike to deal with a serious problem of heavy balls being thrown at workers.
Hurricane Rosa May Cause Flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Where Drought is Possible)
It is rare to see a hurricane hit Arizona, but that is what can happen early next week as the remaining strength of Hurricane Rosa passes over the Western and Southern Deserts, posing a flooding threat.
The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, eastern and southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, with a rainy afternoon arrival on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 10 severe storms have remained at the hurricane or hurricane level within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ coastline.
The latest National Weather Service forecasts 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated precipitation totals reaching 6 inches at the Mogolllon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Western and Southern Deserts including the central Rockies and the Great Basin may have 1 to 2 inches of precipitation, with isolated concentrations reaching 4 inches and possibly more.
For those who are not in danger of flooding, Rosa's freezing rain may be a blessing as the region is experiencing severe drought.
Although flooding is a serious threat, some of this freezing water will be needed as the western and southern areas are currently experiencing severe drought.
According to the U.S. Weather Research Institute, only over 40 percent experience at least one extreme summer, the second most, according to weather.com.
Now, the path of Hurricane Rosa is falling across the Baja California coast of Mexico.
Rosa, still in its Monday morning hurricane-force winds with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and heading north at 12 miles per hour.
The cold air and the incoming water cooled the Pacific and made it sink.
So expect it to make landfall in Mexico with a strong gale on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rains across parts of Mexico can be heavy, with the risk of flooding.
Expected rainfall of 3 to 6 inches from Baja California into the western and northern parts of Sonora, with up to 10 inches and possibly more, weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move northward through Mexico as a tropical cyclone before making landfall in Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical storm, which will pass directly over Arizona and enter southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
The most anticipated threat from Rosa or its remnants is a severe cold spell in Baja California, western and northern Sonora, and the U.S. West and South Deserts, the National Hurricane Center said.
These tear-drop deposits create a drought that can kill people and sweat in the desert, as well as a wetland in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton Massacre: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in an attempted murder investigation after a 16-year-old was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The young man was found with a wound in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was in a good condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock, Avon area, Somerset Police said.
Police have asked that everyone have a mobile phone photo of what happened to him.
Trump says Kavanaugh is a victim, a broken heart, and the wrath of the United Democrats
"The election of Judge Kavanaugh was an election to reject the cruelty and excessive tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered a broken heart, the anger of the Democrats over his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the House on Thursday, angrily and bitterly denying allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he assaulted her a decade ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified against the accused.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the intelligence and character and encouragement" of Kavanaugh that day.
"One vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is one vote to confirm the most mature legal mind of our time", a lawyer with a record of public service and public education, told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president pointed to Kavanaugh's nomination in a different way while discussing the importance of the Republican exit in the midterm elections.
Five weeks left before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't come out, but I really do come out", he said.
So I was everywhere supporting the beautiful candidates.
Trump has joined Democrats in a drive to stop and prevent.
A crucial primary vote in the House of Representatives for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place before Friday, a senior GOP official told CNN.
Indonesia earthquake, tsunami, killed hundreds of people, and numbers continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed as a powerful coastal winds swept away scores of people, when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for festivities on the banks of a river in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-metre (18-foot) storm surge in the evening, swept many into death and destroyed everything in its path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat started to subside, people were celebrating their festivals on the river banks, they didn't run away immediately, so it affected them, Sutopo Purwo Nugrogo, spokesperson for Indonesia's national disaster management agency BNPS said at a summit in Jakarta.
The tsunami was not an accident, it washed away cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the ground, said Nugroho, and the tsunami is said to have crossed the ocean at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to survive the tsunami, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 villages in Palu.
The photos from the disaster center showed many destroyed houses and shops, bridges that had risen and collapsed and mosques flooded.
The earthquake continued to occur in the coastal area on Saturday.
There were systematic effects of the earthquake in the region with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Institute for Technological Research and Development (BPPT) said in a statement that the magnitude of the earthquake Friday was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's land, which lies at the end of a long, narrow river basin, could increase the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "a matter of disruption" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the people were found under the rubble of collapsed houses, he said, adding 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could exceed 300km (190 miles) along the coastline of northern Palu, a region called Donggala, which is close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications had no information but the soap was from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
He said this was an accident, but it could be worse,
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for failing to report a tsunami in Palu, though officials said the strong winds came during the time given for the warning.
In a shared footage of a public gathering, a man can be heard on the roof screaming loudly and warning of a tsunami and the coming of it to the people in the streets below.
Within minutes, heavy rains swept down the riverbank, sweeping away houses and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused extensive damage to power lines that cut off communications in the Palu area and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending planes loaded with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but the refugees still need food and other basic necessities of life.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only, and will continue to be closed until Oct.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the Palu refugee shelter on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian Tsunamis has exceeded 800.
It Is Too Much.
As World Vision's team from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, while its employees were sheltered under the roof of a tapestry erected outside their factory, they crossed a cycle of destruction on their way, Mr Doseba said.
He said "They told me that they saw many damaged houses".
It was very bad.
Even as relief teams began the emergency process of getting disaster relief underway, some complained that foreign aid workers with the necessary skills were being prevented from reaching Palu.
With the help of Indonesian law enforcement, money, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start flowing if the area of the disaster is declared a national disaster area.
That has not happened.
It is still a camp-level disaster said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
 Once the government says, OK, this is a national disaster, we can open up for foreign aid but there is no official announcement.
After the second night in Palu following Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who have lost their faith in their loved ones will be miraculously revived and the spirit of the worst part of the tragedy will be restored.
On Saturday, a small child was found in the pit.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped in a bush for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the captain of the Indonesia national paragliding team, trained two paragliders for the Asian Games in zero, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others detained under the Roa Roa Prison, including Mr. Mandagi, were students.
As a professional paraglider, I have my own mental problems, he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled that within an hour of the news of the Roa Roa Dam collapse spreading in the parachute zone, he hurriedly sent messages to Palu's rivals on WhatsApp, who were participating in the riverside event.
His message, however, appeared in only one gray mark, rather than the dark blue mark.
"I think that means that the messages were not sent", he said.
Thieves took $26,750 during the ATM robbery in Newport on Levee
The pair on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink employee and robbed an ATM in Newport and Levee, according to a report filed with the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the van was cleaning the ATM in the hotel and was preparing to deposit more money, Police Officer Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was at work, another man from behind cornered the Brink's employee and stole the wallet intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects running away from the scene, from the confession, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the assault.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: He was once known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has recently changed his name to Ye and used the same name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes come ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to debut her new single Yandhi.
She replaced the singer Ariana Grande in the show who was killed for "heart reasons", the producer of the show said.
And as an abbreviation of his current stage name, West has previously said that the term has religious connotations for him.
"I believe that 'who' is the most used word in the Bible, in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, when discussing his musical reputation with radio host Big Boy.
 Sing me you, I'm us, it's us.
It comes from Kanye, which means the one, the only being - which is the expression of our goodness, our badness, our confusion, everything.
That fear is also an expression of who we are.
One of the famous rappers changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has expressed his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
The former Western partner, JAY-Z, has used both the occasional non-scripted and capital letters.
AMLO of Mexico has pledged not to use military force for civilian purposes
Mexico's newly elected president Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to use neither the military nor the civilian population as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the brutal attack on students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Mall that he would not use the military to oppress Mexican citizens.
Militants opened fire on a huge shopping mall on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people during a leftist student demonstration that spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support the youth of Mexico by providing monthly stipends for students and expanding public universities free of charge.
He has said that there is no employment and no opportunity for education and that youths are being placed in criminal groups.
U.S. should raise AI funds twice
As China becomes more competitive in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should increase its spending on research in the field, said AI advocate and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The announcement came as several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even though the U.S. as a whole has no known AI plans.
On the other hand, China unveiled its ambition last year: it aims to become the number 1 in new AI deployment by 2030.
"Doubling AI research funding would be a good start, sure all other countries have already gone where the U.S. has gone, but we are looking for the next big thing in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the funding could increase the chances that the next big AI boom will be in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in China's most well-known AI company, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on the AI system that beat the best-selling Othello in America, later becoming president at Microsoft Research and head of Google's China division.
Lee acknowledged the U.S. government's technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next new competitors.
Investigators in the U.S. sometimes work very hard to get government attention, Lee said.
It is not China that is taking over the education authorities; it is the corporations, Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring university professionals to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changes to immigration laws could also help the U.S. support its AI efforts.
I think that people with PhD in AI should be given green card automatically, he said.
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Ethnicity Awareness Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation funds higher education in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund U.S. researchers, but the quality of education services is low in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Defense created the Artificial Intelligence Hub, which should bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of the Select Panel on Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a new project called AI Next.
For the NSF, it's now spending over $100 million a year on AI research.
On the other hand, the U.S. proposal to create a National Security Council for Artificial Intelligence has not worked for months.
Macedonians vote on a referendum to change the name of their country
Macedonians voted Sunday to change the name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a long-running dispute between Greece and the bloc over its bids to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a protectorate called Macedonia, and insists on its neighbour's name in the mountains and the exercise of territorial claims, has blocked its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a proposed new name, but the rivals were bitterly divided and argued that the change would damage the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
Prime Minister Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not contest the election, and the opposition media has cast doubt on whether the candidates will make it past the 50 percent threshold for the nomination to be valid.
The question on the ballot read:  You support NATO and EU membership by accepting the inter-Greece agreement.
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price to pay to follow the accession of EU and NATO member states to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the youth in Macedonia to live the life they want under the watch of the European Union because it means a better life for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Despite the lack of legitimacy, members of the full house have said they will respect the results of the election to make it relevant.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in the upper house.
The state electoral commission said that there were no reports of crime as of 1 pm.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
'I voted for my children, our position in Europe,' said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a local elector in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their ballots for the election in Macedonia for the change of the country's name that will pave the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small platform, and he was putting a chair in front of the chamber of deputies that was filled with people who wanted to block the elections.
"We stand with NATO and the EU, but we want to enter by the north, not by the road of action", Kavadarkov said.
We are a country with no money, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can look for others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian mix.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO's participation would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that many people will like it because more than 80 percent of our citizens want the EU and NATO", Zaev said after reviewing his book.
He said that the result of ee would be confirmation of our future.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Parliamentary Review Commission said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the election - far short of the required turnout.
Another survey, conducted by Telma TV of Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
In that case, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the election to be successful candidates must have 50 percent plus one vote.
The defeat in the election would represent the first major challenge to the government's policy and support for the Southerners since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes all the Brighton defenders for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling lost to Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it very easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker scored a goal in the midfield early in the series.
He ran through Brighton's three defenses, before breaking into an open field.
Aguero found himself surrounded by a crowd of men in blue shirts.
He dismissed one defender before he passed several others at the end of Brighton's basket.
Then he hit the ball in his left hand, finding Sterling.
The Englishman used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his left foot to pass Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his foot", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about playing it for 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky that he scored the goal at that time.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero scored a goal in the Brighton game.
He sent a beautiful ball to the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched him several times before leading Sterling to the top of the post.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net before it was thrown out of the park.
City will meet Hoffenheim in the first leg of the Champions League at 12:55 pm, on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to meet spoiler vs. the Rockies
With the Nationals and the winner's championship out of the way, there was no way to replay the start.
But heavy contender Scherzer is looking to take the lead on Sunday in a game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a winner-take-all game for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rochies won at least a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still need to retain their first division title.
Even if we don't have a goal, at least we can play knowing that the circle here in Denver is in the crowd and the other teams will be playing at the highest level any time I meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be a part of that?
The Nationals are yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but it is reported that it is dependent on Scherzer's involvement in the situation.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, including the practice session on Thursday, will be playing football on Sunday as his rest day.
The Washington native is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallied in West Virginia
The president pointed out another way in the situation involving the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court while talking about the importance of the Republican outcome in the midterm elections.
Everything we have built can be destroyed in November.
Five weeks left before the most important election of our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't get out but I do get out so I'm everywhere and fighting for the beautiful candidates, he said.
Trump continued, "YOU saw this horrible rebellion by the Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They are focused on recovering power by any means possible, you see their stubborn, evil behavior.
They don't care who they have offended, who they have to raise up to get power and control, that's what they want power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, were on a mission to "prevent and suppress".
But you saw over the last four days, he said, that the Democrats are called angry, heartless, evil and dishonest.
He named the high-ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein of the House Judiciary Committee, who received a standing ovation from the crowd.
Remember the answer?
Have you opened the book?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I thought one - there was that ugly show - the ugliest show I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer about the spread.
Self-righteousness is not welcome
When Momentum's supporters were at the local rally I threw a hand at my mouth, not a fist.
Look, I'm the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told and rejected - just for expressing our opinion.
As my colleague in parliament Joan Ryan received the same treatment for her anti-Semitic stance.
In my own words, the opposition party criticized me for rejecting Jeremy Corbyn.
And the need to build a fair economy, a national security, and a Europe, in other words the same issues that Jeremy used to disagree with the previous leadership.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings are usually that.
Sadly today, it is not the voice of the majority and the good, peaceful, and promised land is long forgotten if, indeed, it has started from scratch.
It is a very serious mistake that the Labour Party does not accept different views, and that any views are not considered acceptable in the party.
This started as soon as Jeremy became president, my colleagues, with whom I thought I shared a common political understanding, began to suspect that I would immediately turn around and take positions with which I would never agree - either on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public - it will not matter what I say - there is a lot of hypocrisy immediately followed by a public outcry calling for secession, a centrist criticism, and my saying that I should not be in the Labour Party.
But I am not alone.
In fact, I knew I was more favored than some of my colleagues because of the comments I received that were often very controversial.
I have a vision in the performance and decision making of my colleagues who face criticism of their gender or race every day but do not run away.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this political era is how much negative criticism has become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn last week called for the Labour party to learn a lesson of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the same as before, with no trust in the law or change of electoral laws, the political system and the electoral system.
I had many advice over the last two years that I should be more submissive, and not talk too much then I would have no problem.
But that's not what I'm in politics to do.
Since joining Labour 32 years ago as a student, inspired by the Thatcher government's vision, which left my school with a lot of damage, I have always wanted to lead a good public service for the people who need it most - whether I'm a small party leader or a government minister.
I have not run for political office in the past, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East should be confused about my legal status and the areas I do not agree with the current government.
For those who voted in favour of the bill on Friday, all I can say is that while the country is going to have a Brexit that will have a negative impact on many of our families, businesses and public services, I don't understand the urge to waste time and energy on my support for Labour leaders.
But really the one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituents, or Labour members or not: I am happy to serve you and I promise that no amount of risk or political pressure will stop me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr has not seen a decline in recent times
Two trials and late arrivals have slightly spoiled the final result, but there is no denying that Ayr should win today's Tennent's Premiership.
Now they are at the top of the table, with only one team not having won in ten tournaments.
In the end, it was their stronger defense, and their better chances, that beat those at home, and manager Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
We have tried our best so far, we haven't lost, so we are very happy, he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: Thanks to Ayr, they took more of their time than we did.
A 14-minute penalty shootout by Grant Anderson, completed by Frazier Climo on the head, with Ayr on the front, given a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, which the Warriors missed for the game, gave Melrose a chance to make a number of assists, but Jason Baggot's penalty was not completed on the head.
Climo even extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, once at half-time, he scored and completed the only try to make it Ayr's 17-5 in the second half.
But Melrose started the second round well and his try of Patrick Anderson, which Bagoot completed on the first, reduced the gap to five points.
There was a huge timeout for the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off, and on the opening lap, Ayr took the lead through Stafford McDowall's attempt, which Climo completed in a headlong blow.
Ayr's vice-captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and Melrose again made another man of value by a missed try from Bruce Colvine, in the final of the big fire.
The home team came back, and even more so, when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for kicking Climo's leg out of bounds, outside the penalty line, MacPherson was behind the difficulty Ayr was facing.
Climo overtook him, as he finished a little further into the replay, as Kyle Rowe caught a shot into David Armstrong's box and sent wingman Gregor Henry for the team's fifth try in the house.
The Still Game star is looking for a new job in the restaurant industry.
Still Game star Ford Kieran wanted to join the management company after he found out he had been invited to be the director of a licensed restaurant.
The 56-year-old played Jack Darvis in the popular BBC show, which he wrote and co-wrote with comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the show's run, meaning that Kiernan is set for life when Craiglang comes to an end.
According to the official list, he was the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The minister declined to comment on the news, although the Scottish Sun's editor compared Kiernan to a man looking to join Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
The river is ours: Bolivia lands in a circle in hopes of a court to reopen the Pacific route
The naval headquarters in La Paz is crowded with sailors.
A public building waving a huge and blue flag.
The waterfalls from Titicaca to the Amazon are full of life: the river is our home.
Restoring it is a task.
Across the entire Bolivian border, the memory of the part of the water that flooded Chile in the terrible 19th century geopolitical conflict still rings brightly - as does the desire to sail the Great Pacific Ocean once more.
The expectations are perhaps the highest now in a decade, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Monetary Fund on October 1 after five years of debate.
"Bolivia is now with encouragement, a spirit of unity and calm, and with a positive outlook", said Roberto Calzadilla, the representative of Bolivia.
Most Bolivians will be watching the ICJ ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will find that the interest of Bolivia's claims and - after decades of good case - Chile is obliged to negotiate a free passage to the sea for Bolivia.
Bolivia's charismatic president Evo Morales - who faces a tough re-election battle next year - also has a lot to say about Monday's decision.
We're about to go back to the Pacific Ocean, he vowed last August.
But some analysts believe the court may not rule in Bolivia's favor - and little will change if it does.
The Commission in the Netherlands has the right to grant the territory of Chile, it explained that it will not decide the outcome of the possible cases.
The ICJ's decision comes just six months after the last hearing and shows that the case is not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean legal expert.
Long in favour of the Bolivian cause, four years ago the force was backed up.
The issue of access to the river is one that the current Bolivian administration has taken seriously, Zárate said.
Morales's comments were a joke that angered the rest of Chile, he compared.
Bolivia and Chile will also start talking soon, but it will be very difficult to have a dialogue after this.
The two cities have not changed their representative since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the Bolivian ambassador to The Hague, refused to comment on the court's ruling in a rushed manner.
Monday will bring to Bolivia "a unique opportunity to open a new era in inter-Chilean relations and the opportunity to end 139 years of conflict with shared interests", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the water issue as a political issue.
Bolivia will not give up its right to access the Great Pacific Ocean, he added.
The resolution is a chance to see if we should overcome the past.
North Koreans have said that a nuclear test will not happen unless they have confidence in the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not take the lead in denuclearizing if it could not gain the trust of Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill its commitments at the Singapore meeting between the leaders and the opposition.
His remarks come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is close to re-launching nuclear talks that have been stalled since three months after Singapore's defeat of North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a dream and continued sanctions and U.S. sanctions and declarations of cessation of the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration while Pyongyang has not taken a clear and firm stand.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump wanted a second meeting.
But there is concern that Pyongyang is willing to reject the country's nuclear weapons as the only means of self-defense.
Pompeo is preparing to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion show featuring the latest line and the big headwear and High Street suit awaits you
If you want to lift your helmet or completely block the sun, look elsewhere.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a horrifying collection of hairstyles for their SS19 collection in the street art enthusiasts' Paris Fashion Week.
Instagram has been flooded with amazing hats this summer, but the designers have been sending their amazing designs in a very creative way.
Valentino's signature hat was a fearsome beige hat with a wide, feather-shaped cap underneath the heads of the models.
Other oversized items include a metal knife, a hat, and a hat - but they don't make your head hot.
Thom Browne also showed the cover and the taste of fear - it came just in time for Halloween.
Most of the beautiful masks had lipstick applied and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One design resembles a full-length diving suit with a snorkel and glasses, while the other resembles a melted ice-cream cone.
But you keep the high profile - you're in luck.
The modelers predicted that the giant cloaks could reach the highways around you.
The wide hats came immediately after La Bomba, a two-step-wide grass hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A contract that certified the cap as unfit for use posted on social media sent another big product to the show floor - a large grass beach that was so large that a model in a swimsuit carried it.
A bright orange raffia bag, lined with thin raffia and fitted with a clean skin, was a highlight of Jacquemus La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see a big hat and beach bag arrive on the highway for next summer - as the designer has already made such a big impact it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized relief items".
John Edward: Language skills are important for the world's indigenous peoples
The Scottish Independent Schools set the record for the highest number of academic achievements, but this was furthered in 2018 with outstanding test results, which was matched by individual and team wins in athletics, arts, music and other community efforts.
With a growing population of 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for future and higher education, their chosen vocation and their status as global citizens.
As the education sector can pick and implement higher education curricula, we see new languages emerging as a key and optional subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head".
If you speak to him in his own language, that goes to his heart.
This is a great reminder that we cannot rely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust between people from other countries.
Starting with the results of this year's exam which is coming up, we can see that the language is ranked in the competition table with the highest level of proficiency in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who took foreign language courses scored A-Larges.
Data, collected from 74 SCIS-affiliated schools, showed that 72 percent of students received an A-level in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German, 69 percent of French and 63 percent of Spanish students received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill for children and young people to acquire in the future.
Language is now, as a subject matter, being seen in the same light as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the independent school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Centre for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that employee barriers contributed to the shortage of job opportunities, with 17 percent of these attributed to language skills shortages.
So in many cases, language skills are also a necessary thing for young people to prepare themselves for their future career.
With many job opportunities that may require language skills, these skills are important in business.
No matter what profession one chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have great benefits in the future because of having such a long life experience.
Being able to communicate directly with people from abroad will put you in a position to speak several languages in front of your immediate peers.
From a YouGov poll of over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak enough foreign languages to communicate, while French was the only language with a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This has led to investment in language education now necessary for children today.
Having multiple languages, especially in developing economies, would support children by providing them with better opportunities and access to meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school would have a different language and curriculum.
Some schools will focus more on new languages, while others will teach languages that are seen as most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preference, there should be a number of languages to choose from in the independent schools, which should have teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to providing an environment of learning that will equip children with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
It cannot be denied that in today's world of global business, that languages continue to be of crucial importance for the future of the community, and therefore this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, a new language should be considered as a foreign communication skill.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, albeit with a few exceptions for Scotland's youth.
It must be done well.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Association
Lebron will make his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The season is coming to an end for fans who are waiting to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers manager Luke Walton has said James will participate in the championship preseason game on Sunday between the Denver Nuggets and San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play is not yet known.
It would be more than one but not as much as 48, which Walton said the Lakers website is correct.
Lakers commentator Mike Trudell wrote that James could play in a minor league game.
Following the suspension earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game championship-ending suspension.
"I don't want to play early in my career in my current position, to be prepared", he said.
Trump's campaign season in West Virginia. Youtube Channel
President Donald Trump has launched a series of political rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five political gatherings Trump organized over the next five weeks, including stops for friends across Tennessee and Mississippi.
By holding the nomination process for his own candidate to the Supreme Court open, Trump hopes to boost support for the upcoming midterm elections, while Republicans risk losing control of the House when the bill is introduced in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia convention tonight, and how can you watch it online.
The Trump campaign's Wheeling West Virginia rally was moved to 7 p.m. ET, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia campaign online, below from a live feed on Youtube.
Trump may be referring to this week's debate over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has been mired in turmoil over sex allegations and a highly anticipated Congressional confirmation vote that has been delayed by nearly a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of this multi-party is to help the Republican party in the November elections and strengthen its position.
So, President Trump's campaign said that the upcoming five-week campaign is about "building a stronger base of donors and supporters", as the Republicans try to maintain and expand their control of the House and Senate, according to Reuters.
"The control of the House is crucial to his strategy, which is that the president will visit as many countries as possible, as we enter the political era", Trump's political spokesman who asked not to be named told Reuters.
Hosted by West Virginia Wheeling, the nightly event was able to attract sponsors from Ohio and Pennsylvania and drew coverage from the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, who is moving in on the investigation.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president will come to promote him in the poll", said Simon Haeder, a political science researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showed a year of fighting to keep hope alive and enter the singles championship on Sunday
After three one-sided matches, Saturday's four-man match may be the Ryder Cup's wish.
The power of the throw is entirely a discovered sporting strategy but it is one that is believed by the players, which can often be mistaken for such a sport.
So where do they say that power is now?
They went with six points and now it's four, so we'll take that as a little bit of encouragement, I guess, Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, in fact, of four points ahead and 12 points to spare.
The Americans, as Spieth said, felt they had a little air on their shoulders and had a lot of motivation, and not least the likes of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each scored three out of four.
Spieth was injured from a puncture to a broken collarbone and was walking like a child.
The monkey's loud cries were heard as his round continued, with the ball needed to keep the fourth game in line after he and Thomas hit two shots back after a double.
The kind of shout that met him at the knockout that gave them the win in the 15th, the kind that tells you he believes the Americans are not out of the woods yet.
You have to look inside and think about your own game, Spieth said.
All the athletes have now.
18 holes to have a mark.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup record is undeniable.
The beautiful but unpredictable union of Europe is four out of four who can do no wrong.
Moliwood is the only channel not to broadcast on Saturday afternoons, but they do broadcast on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and the final nine hours on Friday mornings.
The heat, and the energy that came and went from the noisy crowd proved to be the players that were to be the winners on Sunday, with no other elite player more likely to win the European Championship in the sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood and Molinari.
It is best to do both at the same time in different spaces.
The glory of Europe is not yet attained, however.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played Sergio Garcia in the morning's singles match, after being paired with Alex Noren.
One and two misses in nine attempts put the Spaniard and Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of your pit.
Two-man and four-man football is a fascinating close-up because of the dialogue at the centre of this association, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and how one strategy changes instantly.
Europe has played well as a team so far and has been very aggressive until the last day but these four players showed that the USA has a fighting age that some, especially the Stateside are very skeptical.
Europe 10-6 to qualify for Ryder Cup on final day
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a big advantage as they take 10-6 against the United States in the men's singles and the men's fours on Saturday.
The pair inspired by their own, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led by two wins over Tiger Woods in a try-out, four points ahead of Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, chasing to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeline two years ago, kept the Americans in the double-elimination match in the morning, winning the game 3-1.
The US held strong in the four-man event, winning by two strokes, but were unable to reduce the number of wins.
Jim Furyk needed eight points from Sunday's 12-game winning streak to retain their championship.
Fleetwood was the first new European player to win four consecutive titles while with Molinari, the 'Molliwood' name was added after a special weekend in which the pair won their first four Ryder Cup titles by four points.
Having defeated Woods and Patrick Reed in the singles match, they combined to win against Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by a 5&4 overtime.
Woods, who threw two no-hitters on Saturday, showed his ability in the shot put but has thrown 19 of 29 shots in both singles and doubles as well as four and seven in the double.
Justin Rose rested from the morning's singles match, and returned to join Henrik Stenson in the four-man match which was won 2&1 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world.
Europe did not get as much as they wanted, however, on a windy day in the Paris sunset.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas tied for the American flag on Saturday with two points.
They won a hard-fought 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the singles and came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fours, having already lost in the first two rounds.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit to win the title on a one-man play, though as holders, the Furyk team only needed to score a touchdown, a touchdown to retain their trophy.
After two days of fighting, the Sunday attack seemed too much for them.
North Korea says it will not do a nuclear test without a formal agreement
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of their ban would create a lack of trust in the United States and that there was no way for their country to develop its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told an international audience that the annual General Conference on North Korea had followed the "step up" approach of the previous year, such as a halt to nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear test sites and a pledge not to degrade nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we did not see the following comment from the U.S"., he said.
Without trust in the U.S., there is no trust in the security of our country, and in this situation, there is no way we can rely on our weapons first.
While Ri reversed North Korean complaints about Washington's refusal to undertake a nuclear weapons program under which North Korea would receive benefits as it participates in a phased program, his comments were significant because he did not immediately undertake a nuclear weapons program as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri pointed to the announcement of Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump's talks at the first summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to see to the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear arsenal.
Washington has also rejected calls to ease the tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US maintained its nuclear deterrence policy and increased its sanctions to achieve its goals in a comprehensive manner, and further strengthened the declaration of an end to the war, Ri said.
The idea that a ban will cut us off from our religion is a fantasy of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that progress in restricting is eroding our trust.
Ri did not mention the planned second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. president had announced at the United Nations earlier that week.
The minister also spoke of the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the parties involved in the nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the U.S., the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not come under this kind of discussion".
At least Ri's tone has changed dramatically from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea's missile attacks on the U.S. mainland were impossible, to President Trump's call on Kim to be a "missile man on a killing mission".
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year vowed to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in pursuing the disarmament process, but said there was still so much work to be done that the sanctions would remain in place until North Korea dismantles its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time frame for this, saying "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should give Pyongyang credit for its actions.
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the implementation of the Security Council's sanctions will continue with uninterrupted force until we have achieved complete nuclear disarmament, in the long term".
The Security Council has jointly imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in part to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and told him later that he would come to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
He left Pyongyang in July claiming to have made a peace deal, only to be rejected by North Korea within hours for violating similar rules.
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle its nuclear weapons and facilities if the United States follows the same path.
He said Kim told him, "the only appropriate course of action" he is seeking is Trump's security commitment to him and his commitment to Singapore and to further improve relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a full day of study
The study he found at Harvard University this year made it difficult for all students to fall asleep, making it a tradition to wait to study all night.
A scholar found that students in the world's leading universities often do not learn to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Havard Medical School and a faculty member at Brigham and Women's Hospital organized the study, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He got the idea to start the study after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
After that a young woman came up to me and said: Why are you telling me this now, my dear?
He said that no one had told him about the value of sleep - which surprised me.
The lesson, which was released this year, explained to the students how the importance of getting good sleep is important for academic and sports activities, and also for their overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's chief medical officer, said the university decided to start the study after it was discovered that students were not getting enough sleep during the week.
The lesson lasted an hour with a discussion session.
In one section there is a bedroom display, where students are given coffee cups, towels, sports shoes and books to inform them about the effects of sleep and wakefulness and how sleep deprivation affects sports performance, according to the sleep schedule.
In another section, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation increased the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and testicular disease.
School maps have a discussion board, and it prepares participants to think about their daily activities.
We know that he will not change his mind immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - as they have the right to know the health consequences of smoking choices", added Professor Czeisler.
The tradition of staying up all night is still alive, he said, along with new technology and the increasing pressure on students, which means that insomnia is a serious problem.
Ensuring that they get enough, good sleep should be a student's weapon to fight stress, fatigue and irritable bouts, he said - even if you ignore the warning, sleep deprivation puts the brain in an acute state, making them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying biochemistry and biophysics, helped Prof. Czeisler organize the study, having already taken one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
She said that the study opened her eyes and motivated her to push for this to be taught in all schools.
Next, he hopes to ask students who have completed the basic course to complete a similar course before entering the school.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider wearing a headset for when they want to sleep, and when they want to wake up, but also be aware of the potential for injury from screen-based electronic devices such as the LED light, which can disrupt your body's natural sleep cycle, and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Goolu Menga has scored the goal of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered a blow as Dolly Menga's shot closed Steven Gerrard's scattered half in a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first win since their 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard their second win in 18 games as the manager scored eight points off the lead at Ladbrokes Premiership side, Hearts.
Menga scored a goal before the seventh minute of the half, and the Rangers without a boost of spirit were not as capable of scoring.
With Rangers down to sixth, Linvingston moved up to third and was behind Hibernian by a goal difference.
That there could be a future problem for the Rangers after the treatment of the injured winger Calum Spencem, after the analysis of the results of the visitors' side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that beat Ayr to reach the next round of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on his part, took a Livi 11 away, which had taken the Hearts a mark last week, and would have liked to have had his strong team follow their opponents everywhere.
Rangers may be the best catchers but Livingston is the best with the ball they have gotten and made the most of it.
They should have taken two minutes to score when Menga's short first kick sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGrego's goal, but the midfielder missed his big hole.
Keaghan Jacobs' shot encountered goalkeeper Craig Halkett but his teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass him from behind.
Rangers got the control but it seems there is more hope than there is confidence as their team finishes in third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have scored a penalty in the 15th minute against Steven Lawless but the manager Steven Thomson ignored the Columbia player's complaint.
Rangers only made two attempts to score in the first half but Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was unharmed after a header by Lassana Coulibaly and a foul by Ovie Ejaria.
With the goal scored in the 34th minute being a possible outcome, no one can claim that they lost just because of their efforts.
Also the Rangers could not touch Jacob's deep groin.
Scott Arfield was unable to make a tackle as Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who was unable to make a tackle and selected Menga for the dismissal.
Gerrard re-played in the break as he used Ryan Kent to convert Coulibaly who immediately made an impact, as the flanker felled Morelos but Kelly's good run came from his position to block.
But Livingston continued to impress the visitors with their favourite sport, while Lithgow and Halkett played handball regularly.
Holt's side managed to extend their winning run in the final minute but McGregor stopped and refused Jacobs, before Lithgow headed the ball off the side.
Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had a complaint about a late penalty against Jacobs but Thomson ignored it again.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger
Now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and Read ... the day of the future physicist Johannes Wilhem Hans's birth in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter was the basis for a new breed, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado. The characters are not as scientific as the cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What on earth is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, used to detect the presence of minerals like uranium.
When you turn on this headset, you can hear the atomic fallout from the radioactivity on the receiver below.
Evans: Say it, it is happening right now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days short of his 63rd birthday.
But the research that bears his name is far from over.
New molecular vaccines can teach the immune system to detect damaging cells
New vaccines can teach the immune system to detect and kill damaged cells
Vaccines train the immune system to identify harmful cells as a means of treatment
This method involves extracting the immune cell from the patient, and then transplanting it in the laboratory
They can detect a protein common to many plant diseases, and then reverse it.
The trial vaccine shows a satisfactory result in patients with various nut diseases.
One woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her ovarian cysts go away over 18 months.
The method involves extracting the proteins from the patient, converting them in the laboratory to a protein commonly found in many viral diseases called HER2, and then re-embedding the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda Maryland, said: Our results show that we have a satisfactory vaccine.
HER2 also drives the growth of several reproductive diseases, including reproductive diseases of the breast, ovaries, uterus and fallopian tubes, Professor Berzofsky explained.
The procedure is similar to extracting the immune cells from a patient and teaching them to detect a tumor that has worked to treat a specific type of bone disease.
Kanye West went on a rant with Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after appearing on SNL.
Failed
Kanye West was booed in the concert hall during Saturday Night Live after he made a controversial video of himself praising U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would be running for president in 2020.
After playing his third song that night, titled Ghost Town's "Make America Great", he continued to slander Democrats and expressed his support for Trump.
I have had many conversations with white people, and they say: How can you love Trump, he is a black hater?
"In fact, if I was affected by the black hatred, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL opened the show with a bit of a joke featuring Matt Damon, as the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's confession before the House of Commons Judiciary Committee for allegedly assaulting Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not widely reported, comedian Chris Rock took West's comments to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to frighten West with the message.
Again, West told the audience that he had been shot in the back of the room about his helmet.
They spoke badly to me behind the house.
They said, "Don't wear the hat and get out of there".
They were so rude!
And they said again, I'm in deep space", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued. "Do you want to see the mystery? " He says he's going to wear his superman suit, which means you don't have to tell me what to do. " Do you want the world to go on? "
Try the love.
Her remarks prompted an outcry from viewers of the show at least twice and the SNL staff were appalled, Variety reports, with one person telling the correspondent: "The whole club went silent".
West was introduced as the replacement for late rapper Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West has also put on a lot of makeup and makeup in the style of Kalama Perrier's I Love It.
West was endorsed by TPUSA's president, Candace Turner, who tweeted: For one of the toughest minds: DALAL MAKA TO GET OUT OF THE WORLD.
But film critic Karen Hunter tweeted that West just was who he was, and this is a beautiful thing.
But I chose NOT to give credit (by buying his music or clothes or endorsing his art) to someone whom I believe is embracing and promoting harmful beliefs in the community.
He was free.
So we too", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was "previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first actor to change his name, joining the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P.Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg has since replaced Snoop Lion, and fellow rapper Prince, who changed his name to a brand and actor was previously known as Prince.
Sued for attempted murder for stabbing in Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The injury occurred in Ballyhackamore, the police spokesman said.
The defendant was expected to appear in the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The Public Records Office will examine the record of the lease.
Game of Thrones actor Kit Harrington has been fired for playing a bad guy.
Kit Harrington was portrayed by Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones with a horror theme based on the Old Testament concept.
But the actor, 31, has destroyed the image of the hero, saying that this kind of acting on screen means that the boys will feel that they have to be tough before they get the honour.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed "something had gone wrong" and asked how to combat the male-only problem of #MeToo.
Kit, who is married to fellow Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was very concerned about touching the issue.
 Personally, it affects me deeply, now - where have we gone in terms of the role of the man?, he said.
What do we teach boys when they are growing up, about the problems we see now?
Kit believes that the film industry has inherited a small fraction of the male-dominated role, thanks to male characters in the movies.
He continued: What is the accepted and the taught?
What is it that is taught in the theater, and in the classroom that makes boys feel they should be this part of a man?
I think that's the big question in our time - how do we change it?
Because it is obvious that something is wrong with our boys.
In the interview he admitted that he would not be doing the opening or closing story of Game of Thrones if the show came to an end next summer, saying that he and the war on horses was over.
From November Kit will appear in Sam Shepard's True West adaptation which is a story about a filmmaker and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently stated that he thinks meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him on Game of Thrones.
I met my wife in this movie, so in that way she gave me my future family, and she lived my life.
Rose played Ygritte, Kit's character, and Jon Snow's love interest, in the Emmy award winning drama.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's Park in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens infected with HIV and hepatitis.
More than 820,000 people were affected in the city, health officials say.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second and fourth quarters of 2018 alone.
Many of these new words are more difficult to transmit through sexual contact, indicating a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in parts of China through the blood of infected people.
But the rate of HIV transmission through this route has dropped to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Over the past year, the number of people infected with HIV and hepatitis has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a serious issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
China's gay rights laws were relaxed in 1997, but LGBT rights abuses are still widespread.
Because of the country's safety standards, studies predict that up to 70-90% of gay men will eventually marry.
Many of the infections are caused by not having enough sexual contact to make these friends.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been promising HIV vaccines as part of its efforts to combat the issue.
Maxine Waters has denied that her agent was the one who leaked the data to GOP lawmakers, citing "bad faith" and "prophecy conspiracy"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her staff members posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. lawmakers on a Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the accusations were being spread by ultra-right wing groups and websites.
"Hate, hate, and hate is bad", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information that was extracted contained the home address and phone number for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee as well as Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The message appeared online on Thursday, anonymously posted on Capitol Hill during a Congressional hearing on the alleged sexual assault of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The revelation came after three law enforcement officers questioned Kavanaugh.
Privacy sites such as Gateway Pundit and Redstate have confirmed that the IP address used to identify the source of the leak was associated with Waters' company, and leaked information that was shared by Waters's user, Hill.
"This pointless accusation is completely false and completely hateful", Waters continued.
My employee who has compromised his identity, privacy and security due to these fraudulent and false allegations - has no role in the dissemination of the message.
This baseless accusation is completely false and completely unfounded.
Waters' statement promptly drew condemnation online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is a very angry denial", Fleischer wrote.
This means that there is no spirit of this kind as the Lawgiver.
They should not be angry when they are wronged.
They should not argue.
They should not question the motives of the accuser.
They should be mild and calm.
It came as Fleischer assessed Waters' behavior and the criticism of Democrats made by Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing to be highly aggressive during Thursday's debate.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is seeking to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
Great if true, she wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that his company has contacted the relevant authorities and law enforcement regarding these false allegations.
We will see that those who did it will be brought to justice, and they will be held accountable for all their harmful and horrible acts against all my employees.
Johnny English Strikes Again - brought to life by the secret comedy Rowan Atkinson
It is now customary to require Brexit-related content for every new British-made film, and this as it relates to the comedy adaptation of Johnny English - which starred Johnny English from 2003, and then returned in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
Does it mean that the comedy of our own stupidity is now our new commercial window?
Never mind, the silly, rubber-faced Johnny English has re-invented his ability to promote a second time - his name more than anything indicates that he is a comic invention designed for the non-English-speaking parts of the country.
He is indeed a secret service idiot who despite his complicated imitations, has a little Clouseau, a little Mr Bean and the man's eye in the single volume on the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It was then that he was betrayed by a travel agent and the Atkinson International spy who had been made into a Barclaycard TV advertisement, leaving a trail of confusion behind.
There are one or two beautiful moments in this new era.
I loved Johnny English approaching the plane with his old military uniform and a dishwasher in his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for visual comedy is obvious, but the humor is not strong and excessive, and even the less comic films like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now have a comic element to them.
The comedy as it is aimed more at children than adults, for me the Johnny English comic has no special content and its purpose as a comic is not to talk about Atkinson, the Bean character.
The main focus now is that Great Britain is in crisis.
An internet hacker hacked into Britain's most secret spy network, exposed all the operatives at work, and confused the operative at work - a small feat for Kelvin Eldon.
It was the last for a proud and troubled president, who had lost all political support: Emma Thompson tried to do the same thing as Theresa-May but had no material to work with.
His security advisers advised him that since all of his undercover agents were known, he would bring in a retired agent.
That means Johnny English is a freak of nature himself, who is employed as a teacher in the elite schools, but gives lessons that are not written how he is a secret agent: the most common character here, as English gave the School of Rock style of secret school.
English was recalled to Whitehall for giving instructions to the team and his second-in-command, former Bough, Ben Miller was re-instated.
Bough was already married, linked to the head of the water supply, an event which coloured Vicki Pepperdine into a drunkard.
So with Batman and Robin's ever-destroying Secret Service Her Majesty is back, and we meet Olga Kurylenko as the newly crowned Ophelia Bulletova.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister falls under the spell of a tech billionaire, who claims to have the ability to solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta's Jake Lacy does it.
English and Bough embarked on a journey of their own foolish comedy: posing as a chef, they set fire to a French restaurant; they caused a scandal by throwing themselves into the Volta holiday boat; English stirred up a controversy as he tried to use a Virtual Reality headset to identify the interior of the Volta house.
The final painting is made of all materials, but it is all fun and games, there is a small children's TV in all the materials.
It's not too much.
As with other Johnny English films, I was tempted to wonder: could the British actors not give Rowan Atkinson a performance that would better present her talent?
Labour denies that they are not plotting to make the British work four days a week and receive wages for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a reform plan that would see Britons working four days a week and receiving pay for five.
The group wants company executives to hand over their stored assets to employees in exchange for artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them a deliberate day off.
It would be possible for workers to receive three days of leave per week and receive one month's salary.
The spokesperson said that this idea would be in line with the objectives and the economic plan of the organisation to make it more suitable for the employees.
The Trades Union Congress has proposed to introduce a four-day week as a way for workers to gain benefits in the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party spokesman told the Sunday Times: "The announcement of the forecast review is expected before the end of this year.
It is not going to happen immediately but working four days a week is the objective of this organization in terms of economic adjustment to the workers and the collection of the productivity of the members.
The Labour Party would not be the first to back the idea, with the Green Party pledging to work four days a week in the 2017 election.
The Labour Party does not currently support the cause as a whole, not even.
Labour Party spokesman said: The four-day work week is not a Labour policy and therefore is not considered by the Labour Party.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to lay out his plans for reform and economic reform.
Mr. McDonnell said he decided to take back control from the unknown corporate executives and the major profiteers in the lifestyle industry.
The shadow chancellor's plan also means that shareholders in the water company may not get their full share of the capital, as the Labour government may make deductions on the basis of bad motives.
He also announced plans to put employees on company boards and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would transfer 10 per cent of private companies to employees, who could receive a capital gain of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told 60 minutes but the FBI investigation may change their mind
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising questions about the agency's findings and whether Republican lawmakers might change their minds and withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican lawmakers John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy opened up more than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I think, yes", said Kennedy.
I said that in the debate, I said, I said to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterwards, to the accusation, and said, "Did you do that?
He is firm, decisive, and unwavering.
Graham's vote, of course, as written.
"I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, that he will take the charge firmly", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened but I know this: Brett was very upset", Graham added, waving Christine Blasey Ford's hand.
And no one of those who were called believed him.
He was 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing.
What Is Global Citizen Program, and Has It Done Anything to Reduce the Cost?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival featuring some of the most amazing line-ups of performers, and with an amazing goal; to end the world's malnutrition.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people gather in Central Park, not only to enjoy the films of the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival announced in 2012, is an offshoot of the Global Poverty Project, an international policy initiative that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who fight it.
To get free tickets for the event (and if you prefer to pay for tickets), the film audience will have to do some work, or do something like volunteer, send an email to the mayor, make a phone call or any other practical way to raise awareness of their goal to stop theft.
But how did Global Citizen succeed when they only had 12 years to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of giving people free tickets a legitimate way to encourage people to call for action, or is it just another way of what is called kliktivizm - people who think they have something special they are actually doing by signing online petitions or sending tweets?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has generated 19 million from its supporters, and is crying for the achievement of its goals.
He said that these developments have helped to push the world's leaders to announce pledges and projects worth over $37 billion, which will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group pointed out that of the 390 levels of funding it had committed to starting with its production, at least $10 billion had already been distributed or raised.
The same group predicts that savings have impacted 649 million people around the world.
Among the pledges include Power of Nutrition, a U.K.-based partnership of fundraisers and volunteer entrepreneurs dedicated to helping children reach their potential, pledging $35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
With support from the UK government, donors and other governments, and Global Citizen like you, we will make the unfairness of malnutrition a supplementary news story to the hysteria. Power of Nutrition representative Tracey Ullman spoke to a crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said this after 5,000 products were produced, calling on the U.K to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will use nutrition assistance to reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, he asks, "What is the reason to think that we can stop the excesses?"
Global Citizen responded: It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fail and give up.
But, as the struggle for human rights and anti-discrimination has done before us, we will win, because we are stronger and united.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be co-hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy for "blockade" to block Russian energy transfers- Local Writer
Washington can and should use its Navy to block Russia's access to markets, including the Middle East, US Foreign Secretary Ryan Zinke said, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke charged that Russia's involvement in Syria - famously, where it operates at the behest of legitimate governments - is a clever way to tap into renewable energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is to trade power as they do in Eastern Europe, in Western Europe", he said.
But, depending on the employee, there are ways and means to combat it.
The United States can, with our Navy, keep our waterways open, and if necessary, shut down, to ensure that their power is not wasted. he said.
Zinke tells attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that has established itself as the voice of energy consumers in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's policies towards Russia and Iran, and found that the two were identical.
Iran's economic option with Russia is, based solely, on borrowing and repaying fuel for transportation, he said, while pointing to Russia as a dangerous country with an economy based on oil and natural gas.
The announcements come as the Trump administration is trying to boost its export of crude oil to Europe, replacing Russia, which remains a costly competitor for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to push Germany out of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump has made Berlin a target of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is designed to increase the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic plan.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the plan is purely economic and is a bad economic policy.
"I believe we agree that energy cannot be a commodity, consumers should choose their supplier", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said, following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has been taken more firmly from Germany, which has also expressed its support for the plan.
Germany's governing body for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to withdraw from European energy policy and the city-state agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be looking very closely at running for President in 2020, Massachusetts Legislator says
Massachusetts lawmaker Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "very much" consider running for president, following the midterm elections.
At a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren also announced that he would run for office.
It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which includes women in the leadership.
After November 6th, the president will be given a lot of attention.
Warren joined President Donald Trump during the state's presidential campaign, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried to my core about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren expresses his contempt for Trump as well as his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday Warren said "We really need an FBI investigation before the election".
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed that many of Warren's constituents did not think he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of eligible Massachusetts voters said the legislator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent voted for him to step down.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting him to run against 48 percent against him.
Top Democrats have been mentioned for the 2020 race, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make his decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin has referred to Palin's PTSD Track and Donald Trump's campaign.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining Sept.
She was beaten and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he is going through and going back, I can relate to other families in the aftermath of PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers are going through", he told the crowd at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her husband friends in the room and talked about her son and others who went to war, they came back a little different, they came back with courage, they came back asking if there was any respect for fellow soldiers, airmen, and any member of the military, in what they had given to their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against women, prevention and reporting of domestic violence and possession of a weapon as a form of intoxication, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 cities, D.C. are preparing to challenge the new refugee policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia are preparing to challenge the legality of a new U.S. policy that does not provide protection for refugees fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed the relief petition Friday in Washington in support of the refugee who is struggling to survive, NBC News reported.
The full list of defendants in the case of Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been released.
She said she was abused by her roommate and a gang of her sons, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
He was incarcerated in Texas.
Local lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have the highest number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries struggling with the rise of gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. immigration law overturns a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allows undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in Friday's announcement that the new policy "disregards the laws of the state, federal and international jurisdictions".
The federal law requires that a decision on any refugee complaint be made on the basis of the evidence and circumstances of the complaint, which in the form of the closure is contrary to the provisions of the law, the relevant aid cases said.
Lawyers went on to argue in their lawsuit that the policy of barring immigrants from entering harms the U.S. economy, saying they are often independent contractors and "provide the necessary labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration attorneys to not provide protection for refugees fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Refugee protection is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a social group or political opinion", Sessions said in announcing his proposal on June 11.
The refugee protection has not been developed to address all the problems - even the most serious problems - faced by people all over the world.
Tired efforts to save survivors in Palu as death toll rises
For those who have escaped an accident, the situation is even more difficult.
"It's very emotional", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she read to her son who was lost in the refugee camps in the devastated city of Palu.
An ambulance is delivering a body every second.
Clean water is scarce.
City dwellers were seen returning to their damaged homes, picking up supplies from flooded containers, trying to salvage whatever they could.
Hundreds more injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 quake, overcrowded.
Some of the injured including Dwi Haris, who has broken his back and shoulder, are in front of Palu Army Hospital resting, while the wounded are being treated in the hospital due to the strong earthquake still going on.
Tears welled up as he recounted how the fifth floor of the hotel where he, his wife, and their daughter were staying was shattered by the devastating earthquake.
There is no time to save ourselves.
I thought I was in a shell-blast", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then I felt a lull.
I do not know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are well.
U.S. ambassador blames China for the opposition through the media
A weekly Chinese newspaper ran a four-page article in the U.S. media discussing the U.S.-China trade negotiations, with the U.S. ambassador to China accusing Beijing of using American media to spread hate.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Friday pointed to the increased funding of the China Daily and the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after he accused China of seeking to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, a charge China denied.
Trump's allegations that Beijing is trying to interfere with the U.S. election have sparked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new round of Washington's increasingly hostile stance toward China.
As it is imperative for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are engaged in an increasing trade war that has forced them to add tariffs to their import trade.
China's tariffs imposed at the start of the trade war are set to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that backed Trump's Republican candidacy, Chinese and U.S. officials said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who is a major agricultural exporter to China, said China has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in his Des Moines Register opinion on Sunday, "is pushing for the opposition by putting ads in our newsletter".
This hateful propaganda, the Chinese government taking the American culture's precious space is a democratic and non-violent ad and putting paid ads in the Des Moines Register. Branstad wrote.
But compared to the number of newspapers on the streets of beijing, there are so few dissenting voices that the lack of visibility really indicates the different views Chinese people may have about the Chinese economy in crisis, especially in the media controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that one of the leading newspapers in China had refused to publish his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Republicans are targeting female voters ahead of the midterm elections for Kavanaugh's impeachment, analysts warn
As many Republican leaders have defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual misconduct, analysts have warned that they will see a rise in violence, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The reaction to this was so high, that many Republicans had just expressed their desire to continue voting.
The findings could not be restored, Grant Reeher, associate professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School told The Hill of an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he was questioning the final steps Congressman Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) took for an FBI investigation that would be enough to inflame voter anger.
Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will never forget all tomorrow but November, Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they marched along the long House floor where Republicans with the Judiciary Committee voted to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the declaration of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic announced.
The enthusiasm and inspiration of the Democrats will be unique, Stu Rothenberg, a seasoned political analyst told reporters.
People say he has gone up; this is true.
But it can be especially troubling among the uncontacted women who live in the countryside and the young voters, aged 18 to 29-, who, while the president is not pleased, do not vote often.
Even before Ford's public statement outlining the allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts were speculating that the outcry could continue if Republicans continue to support the nomination.
This has been a disaster for the GOP, said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, in an early morning interview, according to NBC News.
It's not just about the Congressional election or the final election or whether Kavanaugh is in office, it's also about how Republicans handle this and how they respond to it, Guy Cecil, the head of Priorities USA, a Democratic election advocacy group, pointed out to reporters.
Nevertheless, Americans seemed divided on who to believe in the case of the Ford and Kavanaugh statements, with the majority siding with the latter.
A new poll from YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents either fully or partially agreed with Ford's assertion, while 35 percent said they either fully or partially agreed with Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably said or uttered something completely untrue during his speech, while only 30 percent said the same for Ford.
Following Flake's complaint, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted him in a drunken drive-by when he was 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court appointment had shown him power when they held a dinner party during their time at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web designer plans to launch a new Internet to join the likes of Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company that will rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new project by the tech giant, Inrupt, is a spin-off of the open source software Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid gives users the freedom to choose where to store their data as well as what information people can access.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the purpose of Inrupt was to take over the world.
We will do it now he said about the new house.
It's time to be in the news.
The application uses Solid technology to give people the opportunity to create a personal online database or POD.
It may contain a list of contacts, a list of appointments, a calendar, a music album, and personal and professional applications.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all in the same browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of an online personal database is that it is up to the user to decide who will receive each message.
The company calls it personal data.
The goal of Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is for companies to gather the right resources, resources, processes and skills to help bring Solid to everyone.
The company had only Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM's purchased memory, the designers employed to work on the project and a community of code volunteers.
From this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own apps without having to connect to each other via the virtual app on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said his team was not discussing with Facebook and Google whether to start or stop the revolution altogether as business models shift instantly.
We do not take their power.
In a blog post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the goal of Inrupt is to provide business power in the environment to help maintain the trust and quality of the newly built Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a vocal voice in the debate over internet freedom.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as the developer and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the future of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Victoria Cross WW1 was awarded to the clergyman
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier in his home country has turned 100 years old.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 in the battles fought at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot by a sniper four days later and was awarded the highest military rank in Britain.
Two of his sons unveiled a memorial stone in his memory at the memorial service in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "a very special sign" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years from the date his grandfather's feat of strength was achieved.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his squad across the Canal de Saint-Quentin amidst a black cloud and in a huge explosion from a cannon and a rifle.
He then ran through the firing line and led the line before firing a shotgun single-handedly and shooting three men in the back.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 said that his grandfather's actions were something he knew he would never do but it was humbling.
He and his brother Dr James Vann laid a wreath after the funeral, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was very happy and honoured to be part of the event and said that it shows through the support of people that the power of a true hero is being wielded.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 instead of getting Peppa Pig
Imagine, staying up all night to fill up a Bellator 206 with people, only to be denied a free-range.
The San Jose post contained 13 fights, including six on the card head and showed him doing all night on Uk on Channel 5.
At 6am, as soon as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to face each other, the UK audience was confused as the character changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not willing to stay up late for the fight.
One Twitter user described the change to the children's show as "a big joke that doesn't make any sense".
"It's official policy that as of 6 a.m. the show is not suitable for children, so they get into the children's program", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and advertising, when asked about the show's premise.
Peppa the Pig, yes.
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their setup to add UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about his moves, I think we can probably work it out", Coker said.
But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning there and we can't fix it until our Sunday, their Monday.
But we work on it.
I agree, when he switched there were so many texts back and forth that they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But no, it is a matter for the government.
I promise you it will never happen again.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we will try to give the supporters what they want and then we will pass.
It is a sad state.
Desert Island Discs: It involved Tom Daley as a "bad guy" in terms of gender identity
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley said that he had felt that he was not good enough for anyone because of his gender - but that motivated him to do well.
The 24-year-old said he didn't know until he went to high school that there was no one like him.
Speaking on the first episode of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke out about the power of gay people to give others a little hope.
He also said that being a father made him less motivated to win at the Olympics.
The long-time host, Kirsty Young, has been in a coma for several months.
Appearing as a reject on Laverne's first episode, Daley said she felt "less than" as she grew up because of "the social stigma against homosexuality".
She said: "To this day, that feeling of inadequacy, and the feeling of being different, are the things that have given me the strength to do well".
She wanted to prove herself, she said, so that she wouldn't upset everyone when they found out about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist, and made her debut at the Commonwealth Games in Australia with a call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live a life of freedom without any consequences and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - US actor Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "made her feel like a bat".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years her senior, last year but said the age difference had never been discussed.
After a childhood experience - she took part in her first Olympics at the age of 14 and lost her father three years later to a kidney disease - she said it was hard to find a peer with the same level of experience and experience.
The couple had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and June-Daley who said his outlook on life had changed.
If you asked me last year, it was only about winning the gold medal.
And, you know, there are more to it than Olympic gold.
My gold is Robbie.
His son of the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, has just been diagnosed with a brain tumour.
Daley said his father did not believe he would die, and one of his last questions was whether they had booked tickets for London 2012 - as he wanted to be in the spotlight.
I can't tell him that he won't live to be in front of me. he said.
I held her hand when she stopped breathing and it was only when she stopped breathing and died that I accepted that she was not dead, he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I know this is what I have dreamed of my whole life - to be able to swim in front of my home crowd at the Olympic Games, there is no feeling greater than that", he said.
It inspired her first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which was performed during her Olympic warm-up and was also a shock.

Mickelson was left unplaced in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his style to avoid being a disappointment.
Captain Jim Furyk replaced Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for its 12th time, on Saturday for the men's doubles and the men's fours.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as was the custom for the United States, the five-time champion spent his days playing poker and improving his game at the casino in the hope of improving his condition.
He was never a great hitter even at the peak of his career, and the 48-year-old man did not fit the type of profile Le Golf National needed, as the tall man took long shots without suffering.
And even if the star isn't afraid of himself, Mickelson, in game nine on Sunday will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari who is well on his way to winning, who along with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood won all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, with four points behind, start the 12-round match of the one-man, starting from the warm-up, Mickelson's game could be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his partner, not that he had anything else to say.
He chose his assignment well today, slapped me on the back and shook my hand and said, it will be ready tomorrow, Furyk said.
HE had great confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame, and has contributed a lot to the team in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I waited longer, but that's how it turned out and that's how we thought we would go.
He wants to be in the front of the line, like everybody else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It was perhaps the end of his Ryder Cup career which was below his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and one draw, although Furyk said his absence caused some misunderstanding in the team.
He is funny, he is sarcastic, he is funny, he likes to make people laugh, he is a good person to have in this club, he explained.
I think the young players were excited to challenge him this week, it was a thrill to watch.
It offers more than just playing games.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knew that a large lead could soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that to take a big lead in the men's singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup can be a very uncomfortable ride.
The Dane made his first appearance at the 1997 tournament in Valderrama, where part of the Seven Ballesteros were Captain five points ahead of the Americans but were able to cross the finish line only with their nose in front by a small gap, and won 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You have to try to defend yourself with a big score going into Valderrama; we went into Brookline with a big score, where we lost, and in Valderrama we won but it was a little bit", Bjorn said, looking back after the 2018 Class 5-3 win on Friday and then, with a 10-6 win at Le Golf National.
So the histrionics would show me that everyone in the group is not done with this.
You will try harder tomorrow.
Get out there and do whatever you have to do.
This process did not end until the mark was received on the staff.
Our goal, our goal, is to win this trophy, and that is where our eyes are.
I have said before, I am looking at the 12 players on our side, but we know very well what is on the other side - the best players in the world.
Appreciating how his players have done on the tough golf course, Bjorn added:  I will not run away from myself this time.
Tomorrow is a different beast.
Tomorrow is a one-man show that comes to the fore, and that's something different to do.
It's good to have a partner in the front row when things are going well, but when you're alone in the front row, that's when you're tested as a golfer.
That's the message you need to convey to athletes, is to bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your relationship behind and you will be able to offer yourself the best.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk's face-off numbers would require his players to do better on their own than with a partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself had been present at the end of the great day of the revolution, after having won the battle at Brookline before being defeated by Europe in the Miracle at Medinah.
"I remember all his words", he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, had gathered his team on the final day of the tour.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but it would be good to start strong like we saw in Brookline, like we saw in Medinah.
After he had crossed the line, he was making a huge impact in the midfield.
We organize our lines and we put our lines in the order we want, and we know, we're trying to do magic all day.
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the race and will face Rory McIlroy in the title game, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the top of the order.
I took one of these guys because I thought I had everything, Bjorn said of the color choice of one of his guys.
New German weapons were shipped again
The new frigate of the German Navy should be commissioned in 2014 to replace the Cold War era super-weapon, but it won't be there until at least next year due to poor systems and an expensive price tag, the country's media has announced.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but a delay in delivery followed the plan's limitation.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be the replacement for the upgraded Bremen-class frigate.
It was understood that they would have extremely powerful gunpowder, aircraft missiles and naval mines as well as some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared and sonar.
Other important projects included lengthy repair times - the new frigates should be able to be commissioned up to two years out of the port.
After all, all these delays mean that the special weapon - which was supposed to give Germany a chance to show its strength abroad - will be obsolete by the time they start work, Die Zelt points out.
The F125 frigate was full of problems that made headlines last year when the German Navy refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship with its owners after it had been launched.
Little is known about the reason for its return, but German media have pointed out a number of "software and hardware damage" that are of great importance, making the weapon useless if it is transported to the battlefield.
The lack of a crew was critical as 120 sailors would man the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class - only half the number of men manning the older Bremen class frigates.
Moreover, it also meant that the ship was too large to be of any use and prevented the Navy from adding any further boosters in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to have carried twice as many types of ships of the same class as those used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the personnel - is also in question.
It is reported to have spent €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the original €2.2 billion.
The new frigates' difficulty became more critical with the soon-to-be-released warning that the German Navy was losing strength.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German defense legislative assembly, declared that the Navy had effectively run out of ships that could be deployed.
The official said that the issue has become more urgent in recent times, as the older ships were decommissioned but no ships were produced to replace them.
It was a coincidence that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate was ever built for the Navy.
The National Trust pays attention to the secret life of the ant
A new study in a park in the Scottish Highlands aims to show how mice are used to scavenge food.
It is hoped that the discovery will inform the evolution and behavior of these unique mammals and help in future conservation efforts.
The study by the National Trust for Scotland's scientific researchers will include the famous pipistrelles and soprano pipistrelles as well as the brown long-eared at Daubenton and Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key points in the park to monitor the activities of these bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out routine checks using hand-held scanners.
An analysis of the sound of all the recorded chambers will reveal how often the mice call and what each species does.
A map of the area and a logbook will be created to create a detailed environmental map of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show the most important parts of the habitat and how each species uses it.
This information will help to decide on the benefits of habitat management projects such as grassland production and how best to conserve woodland for mosquitoes and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the last decade.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect the sleeping and living quarters.
Wind turbine and lighting can pose hazards, as well as flypaper and some chemical safety devices used in construction, as well as attacks from house cats.
The mole certainly did not lose his head.
After all, because of their nocturnal habits, their hearing is more important than their eyes when a predator is about to strike.
They use echo-detection techniques to catch bugs and obstacles in their way of worship.
NTS, which is responsible for managing over 270 old houses, 38 vacant gardens and 76,000 hectares of suburban land, called the mosquitoes essential.
There are ten trained marines who are constantly searching, scouting and occasionally rescuing.
The agency has set up the first special reserve in Scotland for bats at Threave Park in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten species of bats in Scotland.
The park's manager David Thompson says that the park is the best place for them.
In Threaves here, we have a beautiful part for monkeys, she said.
We have old houses, old trees and all the nice accommodations.
But there is still much that is unknown about mosquitoes, so our work here and in other home gardens will help us understand more about what they want to live well.
He also said the need to check for bats before designing a yard could inadvertently damage a maternal and child bed, could kill up to 400 mothers and their offspring, could wipe out the entire population.
It is a crime to kill, torture, or harass bats or to disturb their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scot official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to get involved.
He said: We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species, whose numbers we don't know.
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the allegations of sexual harassment against him as "myth", saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers have already sued the German newspaper, Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portuguese footballer and Juventus player was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was accused of paying her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live video after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, called the story fake news.
No, no, no, no, no. I was just trying to help.
What they said today, fake news, the five-time Ballo d'Or winner said on camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It is not unusual.
They want to be known by my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a very happy and kind person, the player added, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "an unacceptable report for a private investigator", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will receive a fine for "violation of the rules at a rate equal to the damage caused, is probably one of the biggest violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 inside the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the dance hall, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's apartment, where he assaulted her with force, according to a filing with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo did the groundbreaking after the allegation and told him that he was 99 percent real man one percent faceless.
The book states that Ronaldo believes they had a sexual relationship but everyone believes otherwise.
Mayorga also said that he went to the police and took pictures of his injuries in the hospital, but was later persuaded to decide not to go to court because of the fear of reprisals and the thought of retaliation against him in the state.
The 34-year-old said she wanted to reverse the decision as she was still in pain from the allegations.
Ronaldo was looking to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the recession hit, and this summer, he moved to Italy's top team, Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will be saddened by the loss of its car manufacturers
The UK will be a sorry place to be if it loses its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "ironic" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily halt production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We want an agreement", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the risk of delays in the ground if no Brexit deal is reached could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
My guess is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production halted at our factories Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager in Burnaston said.
Other UK car manufacturers fear about leaving the EU without a deal as cross-border business will be conducted, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for its part, has announced that it will close its Oxford mini factory for a month after Brexit.
The biggest impact on the car makers' claims is the risk of market disruption if no deal is reached.
Production at Toyota is done on a direct-supply basis, while the 37-unit car parts are sourced from suppliers, both UK and EU for its passenger cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a disruption in the supply chain that the manufacturer says could lead to delays and shortages of vehicle parts.
It is not possible for Toyota to leave more than one day's supply at their factory in Derbyshire, the company said, adding that production would be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "designed to pass all the checks to the bottom".
"We want to have a deal. We want to have a better deal that gives us an opportunity as I say, that not only gets us moving now but also lets us take advantage of this opportunity", he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
The evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that the successful delivery process should be continued.
Toyota cannot say how long the production will be stopped, but in the end, they warn that price increases will reduce efficiency and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the factory's crew coordinator, said his team misses him very much: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back".
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a clear and confident plan for our future relations with the EU".
Trump and Rosenstein may meet again, White House says
The crucial meeting of Donald Trump and Deputy Chief Justice Rod Rosenstein could be delayed until next week as the battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is in charge of special operations Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's aides and Russia and the blocking of impeachment hearings by the president.
But Trump was either fired or resigned from the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's freedom, fueling months of Washington hype.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had allegedly used a tape recorder to record Trump's debate and impeach the president by way of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this story.
But last Monday he visited the White House, amid complaints that he wanted to quit.
Instead, a meeting was announced between Trump, who is at the United Nations in New York for Thursday.
Trump said he would not have liked to fire Rosentein but then shortened the meeting to avoid the confusion of the Senate Judiciary Committee with Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of corruption, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the run-off to the Senate election.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosentein hearing, he said: "Don't set a date for that, it could be next week, I think that's back to a week because of everything that's happening now in the highest court in the country".
But we'll see, I always like to keep the media informed of what's happening right away.
Some journalists will pull the trigger: Sanders has not been the White House correspondent since September 10.
Supervisor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders blamed the lack of editing on the "high viewership demand" of TV journalists, though he said: "I don't really agree with them that they are looking for high viewership".
He compared direct communication between Trump and the media to a cover-up.
The president has more interview times than any president before him, he said, adding that he did not cite any evidence: We have looked at these numbers.
The press will do, Sanders said, but if the media have the opportunity to directly question the president of the United States, that's better than talking to me.
We've tried to do that many times, you've seen us do that the last few weeks, and that's going to replace the editor when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly comments when he leaves the White House or participates in interviews or press conferences when foreign dignitaries are present.
Media conferences alone are not unusual.
In New York this week the president probably explained why, that appearances are not good, sometimes bad appearances in front of the press.
The Secretary of Health has written to EU and NHS Scotland staff about the Brexit risks
The Health Secretary has written a letter to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and request that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter within three months to wait for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has offered to cover the costs of the application of the EU citizenship status for its divided public service.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: This summer, the UK-EU negotiations and engagement have progressed, and a decision is expected in the coming months.
But the UK Government is also increasing its support for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is going to be a very difficult time for you guys.
That is why I want to reiterate my great pride and respect for all staff for their help, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, are bringing the necessary experience and expertise to extend and improve the functioning of the health service, and to help patients in our communities and workplaces.
Scotland is your home, we want you to be here.
Christion Abercrombie is about to undergo emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie had emergency surgery after he suffered a hamstring injury in a 31-27 victory over the Vanderbilt Commodores, and was replaced by Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly after halftime.
"HE came over and threw himself over there", Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the area before putting him on a ventilator and taking him back for further tests.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was no further detail on the nature/degree of the injury and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a college runner-up in the red jacket, was in his first year at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five blocked shots on Saturday before leaving the Games, which brought his tournament record to 18 blocks.
Business people will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Foreign businessmen will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and use the money raised to help the homeless under the Tory scheme.
The move will undermine the progress of Corbyn's campaign to attract voters and grow
Stamp duty will be charged on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Bank expects to raise £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Foreign businessmen are being charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - the money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
That would be seen as an attempt to undermine the progress of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract younger voters with the promise of more affordable housing and chasing higher earners.
Stamp duty will be levied on individuals and businesses who fail to pay UK tax, and the above mentioned amount will further the Government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the existing stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-let - could be as high as 3 percent.
The Bank expects it to rise to £120 million a year.
It was determined that 13 per cent of non-UK residents in London purchased newly built properties, raising costs and making it difficult for first-time buyers to progress through the housing market.
Most of the city's financial districts - especially the downtown - have a deserted countryside due to the high number of foreign buyers, who spend most of their time outside the city.
The new legislation comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a strike to help young people get their first homes.
He accused large manufacturers of keeping assets at high prices by leasing land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to leave lots in low-cost housing to address Britain's housing shortage.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a housing reform package and has attracted attention, including the control of rents and the end of evictions not human fault.
He also wanted to give the council more authority to build new buildings.
Mrs May said: Last year I said I would give up my government to restore the British dream - the life that deserves better for every new race.
But that meant repairing our damaged apartment building.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and start a life here.
However, it cannot be safe and easy for people and businesses within the UK, and overseas, to buy a home as British residents and labourers.
For many people, the dream of owning their own home is already a reality, the stigma of homelessness is already a reality.
Jack Ross: "My greatest wish is to rule Scotland".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has said his biggest ambition is to be Scotland captain one season.
The Scotsman, 42, is happy to fight for the return of a North-East League team, who are currently ranked third in League One, three points below the first.
He visited the Stadium of Light this season after replacing Mir Stren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a professional soccer player.
I got a B cap that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland and Hampden a lot, with my father when I was a kid, and it was something that I always remembered.
The opportunity will come, however, if I do well in team management.
Those who came before Ross as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gue Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not afraid to pursue the big names in the big leagues, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The progress for me this season will be measured by can I get this team back to the Premier League?
Due to the platform and structure of this club, there is no doubt that it should be in the Premier League, he said.
It's not an easy task to go back there, but I can only consider myself a success here if I can do the same there.
Ross had only three years in his managerial role, after a short spell as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on the Hearts staff.
He went on to help Alloa get back to the third round, and turned St Mirren from the top of the table to the Championship trophy the following year.
But Ross said he feels more confident now than he did during his time with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It could be a good alliance, he hoped, to take control in Alloa.
I really believe that management is what I learned the most, rather than dance.
It sounded bad because I did well, lived a good life, and had some good visions of the heavens.
But it is not easy to do so.
There are many things you have to go through each week.
I'm still going through that in terms of the challenges and stress of the job but the management is very good.
I have always wanted to do control, and now that I do, it gives me the most sense of peace, of being myself in my adult life.

The best time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, research says.
The summer heat has cost money for Britain's fading bars but put more strain on the restaurant business.
A bar association saw sales up 2.7 per cent in July - but restaurant revenue fell 4.8 per cent, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of CGA business consultants, who raised the figure, said: "The sun is still up with England's participation in the World Cup long overdue means that July followed a pattern to last June, when bars rose 2.8 per cent, except for the restaurant owners who had a big spike.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business in June worsened in July.
The most successful bar is the same as the restaurant that is the lowest.
Bars and food stores suffered from the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seemed that people wanted to go out for a drink.
Across these bars and stores, wine sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM's entertainment and care analyst said: "These results follow the pattern we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of large-scale sporting events or sporting events are also still major factors when it comes to selling to the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant industry continues to decline, although a 4.8 percent decline in sales per year would be a major pain in the ass in the current budget.
The long summer heat could not come at a bad time for the food vendors, but time will tell if the slightly better weather in August will bring some much-needed rest.
The aggregate sales growth across bars and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in new business growth.

One in five children has a secret social networking account that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some under the age of 11 - have a social media account and hide it from their parents and teachers, research shows.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rise in fake Instagrams
The news has fueled fears that sexual content is being distributed
20% of students said they have a checking account to show their parents
One in five children - some under the age of 11 - create a social networking account and send it to an adult.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The report has raised fears that sexual content is being distributed.
Twenty percent of students said they also use a clean account to show their parents, but they have a secret one.
A mother stumbled upon a secret site where her 13-year-old daughter saw a girl and other girls "raiding" her.
The survey, from Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 percent of 11 to 18 year olds have two profiles, while half believe they have a private account.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: It is alarming that many young people are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the Voice of the Champions in the Scottish Parliament seat.
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed to the board of directors of the Scottish League of Conductors as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated player, and manager Ian Beattle described the injury as a great opportunity for the team and the club to gain an advantage over his experience of international football over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a huge respect across the Scottish, UK and global competitive scene, and we are confident that the Scottish competition will gain a lot of traction by introducing her to their platform", Beattie said.
Doyle said: I would love to work as a voice for the competition, I hope I can really help and help lead the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta in the build-up to her fourth Olympic gold medal, is now a BBC analyst, unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: One month ago today I had the paralysis.
Unable to walk.
The doctors said only when I could recover or how much I could.
It was a big job but I came back to work, I learned how to walk and now I'm doing hard work!
Thank you for the message of encouragement!
Breast milk advertisements and discussions of mothers and cows divided opinion online
The dairy industry has been dividing online opinions by using advertisements and reviews of mothers and cows and their milk.
To mark the launch of what is claimed to be the world's first concealed wearable breast pump, consumer technology company Elvie launched a video and audio ad with three buttons to showcase the freedom the new pump offers mothers.
Four real moms danced in a cow barn full of cow feed with words like: Yes, I'm sucking my milk, but you won't find any chicks If you haven't figured out yet these are not milk, these are my breasts.
The main character continues: Save it, save it, I feed the little ones, save it, save it, my daughters, I am breastfeeding.
However, the advert, which was previously posted on the company's Facebook page, has already caused online problems.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reviews from viewers, with most saying it downplays the threat of the dairy industry.
The big bad decision to use cows to spread the message of this product.
"Like us, they conceive and give birth to a child to produce milk, only their young are fed within a few days of their birth", one writer said.

Another wrote:  What a terrible shock for both mother and child.
But yes why not use them to spread the message of breast milk to mothers who have the opportunity to keep their babies?
Another added   Even advertising is not necessary.
Others defended the ad, with one woman believing that the threat was beyond her control.
I think this is a beautiful flower.
I can buy one if I am breastfeeding.
I was a redemptionist.
The ad was a bit of a nuisance but it was there.
This is the product of a great genius,  one writer.
Another wrote: This is a new advert targeted at mothers who are doing the cleaning (sometimes at work or in their bathroom) and find themselves feeling unwell.
This is not an advert for the milk industry.
At the end of the video one of the women shows that they have been dancing since but there is a hidden ransom in their bra.
The perception that supported the ad was based on the perception that the majority of women with weaning said they felt like cows.
The Elvie's Rescue is a completely hidden, fully concealed, strap-on or head-on device that is hidden in a babysitter's bra, allowing women to move about, hold their baby, and go out to breastfeed.
Ana Balarin, a co-founder of ECD and Mother commented: The Elvie Rescue is a great new product that deserves to be released and inspired.
By showing the differences between women in childcare and cows in milk production we want to put the milk pump and all its accessories in focus, and also show it a way of giving a new and more accessible home, the feeling of the great freedom that the new medium will bring.
This was not the first time Elvie's ransom had caused a stir.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared to be cleaning the walkway for the famous Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Children from the Emergency Movement to the Texas Camp
The number of children in immigration custody has increased and although monthly crossings have not changed much, due to the aggressive policies and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children in foster care.
Traditionally, most adoptive parents themselves have no record, and they fear to compromise their own right to stay in the country by coming forward to adopt a child.
The threat escalated in June, when the central government announced that sponsors could come with their elders and other relatives to submit fingerprints, and that their data would be shared among immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency has arrested several people who have applied to be advocates for minors and unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Up to 80 percent of people are supporters or family members of supporters in the country illegally, many of whom are illegal immigrants.
So we are continuing to pursue the people", Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to expedite the process, the authorities have introduced a new policy requiring some children to be presented in court within one month of their arrest, rather than 60 days after, which is the previous standard, by the housing authority.
Most will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to petition their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
The victims would be removed as minors for immediate examination.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to be aggressive or aggressive, which may lead to aggressive displays or attempts to escape, from the home staff and complaints that have appeared in the system in recent months.
The spokesperson said that the ideas are being developed in a large building like Tornillo, where the lighthouse is still too small and neglected, due to its size.
They added that taking children to the camp does not give them enough time to support their spirits or to greet their friends, which can lead to bullying, many of whom are currently being bullied.
Syria told troops in US, French and Turkish bases to leave immediately
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees, despite the country's eight-year civil war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign troops were on Syrian territory illegally, under the cover of a military coup, and would be treated accordingly.
They must leave immediately and without any conditions, he told the congregation.
Moualem stressed that the war on terror is over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people were killed in 2011, while millions were forced from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue this fight until we expel all Syrian refugees for the two groups of cowards and any overseas stay is illegal.
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in the fight against President Bashar al-Assad.
France had more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn city.
Speaking for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good for them to return, and blamed some western countries for "fear and wantonness" that forced the refugees to stay longer.
We have invited the embassy and humanitarian groups to start these repatriations, he said.
They are using what should be only a humanitarian problem to make politics.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction assistance for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the rebels to end the conflict.
UN delegates say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a safe zone in the last stronghold of militants in Idlib has created an opportunity to pursue political issues.
The Russian-Turkish decision ended a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region, which is home to 3 million people.
Moualem Kassimou stressed that the agreement had "clear limits" and expressed hope that the military's defeat would drive out jihadists including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated".
UN Secretary General Staffan de Mistura is hoping to hold the first meetings of the newly formed coalition between the government and the opposition to draft a draft military strategy for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the stage for the Syrian government's participation in the conference, saying that the work of the conference should be restricted and the drafting of the current constitution should be banned, and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Round
From that perspective, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as most reasonable people might expect, impeachment and misconduct end his presidency early.
In what will undoubtedly be the final death of the greatest president!
Now, there is no sign of the test fatigue.
Since 2014, the prime-time broadcast rate has risen by 1.05 million on CNN while it has nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had the highest average viewership of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" remained at the top of the charts with 3.5 million viewers on the night of the big news.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's something we understand", said Neal Baer, the host of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about the cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol bombing.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different take.
He recalled driving a car in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would compare Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"Because it makes me laugh", Ms. Scovell told me.
There is a recreational value in the mess.
Indeed, unlike anything else on TV, the news coming out of Washington will determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, both the families of the refugees who can be reunited and the economic well-being of the world.
Distraction is a luxury that only the wealthy can afford.
But for now, it's more than being a citizen and knowing what happens when you find yourself in a six-hour window of time viewing panels of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of the deep-sea head for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-bombing suit (the suit is full of hubris, The Washington Post said) and the inclusion of Stormy Daniels's description of Mr. Trump's ugly body.
I'll never look at Super Mario the way I used to.
"Part of what makes it feel like a show is that it gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, president of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of "Pawn Stars", for Trump's show that changes artists and daily storylines (following N.F.L. fights, praising Kim Jong-un).
You need to be flexible.
When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was at 80 degrees and the ocean was on the beach of Kauai, but he was in the room watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He is unable to pull himself together, unlike Brett Kavanaugh who wants to meet the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives and the future of the Supreme Court in the air.
I remember when we used to do all those silly shows in the old days, people said, This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization, Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it means they're right.

Apart from the budget cuts, midterm elections are the most difficult for House
It is not uncommon for the 17th Pennsylvania to be funded, thanks to a congressional redistricting that got two incumbents to run for the same seat.
The Pittsburgh city council recently voted against Rep. Conor Lamb of the Democrats - who won his seat in another election in a special election last spring.
Lamb was succeeded by another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is largely confined to the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old courthouse was illegally segregated in favor of Republicans.
The new 17th Congress has started a campaign fundraising drive among the main political parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after his narrow victory in the highly anticipated March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The Republican held the seat for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small step forward.
U.S. Expected to Punish El Salvador for Supporting China, But Stopped
The delegates noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had supported Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a successful meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and was in a hotel room in Panama until the partners fired one of the Trump Organization's executives.
The State Department has decided to recall the heads of the American embassies from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decision to withdraw support for Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties were only applied to El Salvador, which received nearly $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, economic development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which include a cut in financial aid and the proposed visa restrictions, should be a shock to the Central American country and its unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal negotiations continued, North and Central American officials moved to a higher-level meeting focused on security and economic development to follow up on the same summit last year that saw a step forward in efforts to discourage migrants from travelling to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to go ahead, and to immediately stop any discussion of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to meet with the assembly, which is currently meeting in mid-October, in a sign of the need for the administration to meet, the delegation said.
The three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no news of violence or new sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate which was described by the three American officials, including two representatives, who agreed to discuss the internal debate in a confidential environment.
Their report was confirmed by an external auditor, who was close to the administration and spoke in a confidential manner.
School Record
The next step to be taken would be a complaint by special counsel Robert Mueller for the alleged corruption of Mr. Trump, for which there is clear evidence in the public record.
It was also announced that Mr. Mueller is turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's media and Russia were involved in his attack on our elections.
Congress should change hands, and Mr. Trump will find himself questioning that, as he prepares to appear again before the electorate, and possibly later before a jury of his peers.
That's a lot of potential, not that I want to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable - or that of his European allies.
There are decisions we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the struggle will last.
In 1938 the German authorities were ready to overthrow Hitler, if the West blocked him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We fell, and we had no chance to escape the year of great destruction.
The history of the revolution is revolving around the same core, the struggle for democracy is not going to stop or slow down.
Americans are now facing many major changes.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a lot of trouble since the filing of that, last year, he compared the secret recording to the president and accused him of being unfair to the company.
Mr. Rosenthal said that the Times report was inaccurate.
How would we respond if the new F.B.I. investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's appeal is not complete or good - or if it is filed in the Supreme Court despite the allegations of obvious sexual assault and evidence of wrongdoing?
After all, are we going to have a mid-year election for Congress that will retain Mr. Trump?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be ready for a long probationary period.
But I believed that we would not fail, based on what we had learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime.
He survived, fled to the United States, but, 60 years later, I was sent to light the Sabbath candle on the swastika table.
Or that's my culture, how can I have any real hope for our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers has high hopes for the Rapid Vienna tournament
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, followed by a dreadful loss to Spain's Villareal earlier this month, will put them in a difficult position to finish out of the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans out of the first round of the league season until the 2-2 draw between Villareal but he believes Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to more spectacular things.
"IT'S a good mark for us because Villareal is a good side", the 31-year-old said.
We entered the game hoping we could win and come out with a single point.
Maybe we should have a win in the final but, in general, the winner is the winner and the result is good.
They seemed better in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the better side.
Entering Thursday, it was another big night for Europe.
Hopefully, we can get three points but it will be difficult because they got a good result in their last game but, the crowd is with us, I am ready that we can go ahead and get a good result.
Last year was very difficult, with all the things that happened both my injury and the changes in the tournament itself but there is a real spirit about it now.
The same game is good, my team has a vision; good training.
Hopefully, we can also move forward now, put the years of competition behind us and do well.
Women are shy because of the fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of how much they wanted care, few people were talking to family members about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children about it.
People want a family member to care for them, but they don't do anything to share the burden, said Holly Snyder, vice president of life safety business for Nationwide.
Here's where you start.
Communicate with your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not communicate your needs in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to agree on where and how care will be provided, where those choices may be important and how much will be spent.
Talk to your financial adviser: A financial adviser may also help you to come up with a plan to pay for the expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include an existing long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance policy-funded package to help you cover these expenses or a personal insurance policy using your own funds - if you have the funds.
Deal with your legal issues: Decide on legal issues at the time.
Keep a healthcare proxy ready so that you can assign it to someone you trust to take care of your health and make sure that specialists meet your needs and interests if you cannot communicate.
Also, consider the ability of the lawyer to handle your finances.
You would appoint a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that your debts were paid if you were unable to do so.
A simple illustration: Imagine that your older parents had a medical emergency and were on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer for the medication and the avoidance of the drugs?
Put these details in writing so that you are prepared.
It's not just about the money, but who are the doctors? Martin asked.
What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Plan the plan".
A man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, aged 40, was in Oxford Grove Park in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the heart, stomach and hand.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 BST, as "unprovoked".
The victim did not see the person who hugged him.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have asked for witnesses.
earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
As communications were cut, rescue workers were unable to receive any information from the Donggala municipality, the northern district of Palu close to the epicentre of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were displaced by the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palau is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of the strait on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a 300 km (180 mi) long peninsula on the western and northern coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The municipality, an administrative subdivision of the prefecture, had a population estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the Park, but is more prevalent in Morowali, and the Sulawesi frontline.
Tsunamis have hit Palu and Dongalla several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and damaged hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, which is frequented by earthquakes and volcanoes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province off northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 cities, and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of large earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 earthquake hits the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that hits the southern coast, killing up to 700 people.
2009: An earthquake measuring 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 hits the island of Mentawai, off the coast of Sumatra, and causes a tsunami of 10 meters in height, destroying several villages and killing up to 300 people.
2016: A minor earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya province of Aceh, causing damage and disturbance and reminding people of the 2004 tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered at this time, but houses collapsed and over 100 people died.
2018: A large earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The quake damaged thousands of homes and left some travelers with temporary problems.
Sarah Palin's son arrested on charges of assault
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of assault, conspiracy to commit assault and resisting arrest, according to a complaint filed by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
When a girlfriend tried to call the police to report a crime, she took her phone from her hand.
Palin was arrested in the pre-trial Mat-Su, held on a $500 bond and unsecured, by the KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he described himself as innocent, and when his request was denied, the network was stunned.
Palin faces a Class A felony, meaning she could face up to a year in jail or a $250,000 fine.
He has been charged with a Class B crime, punishable by one day in jail or a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first criminal charge against Palin.
In December 2017, she was accused of assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case was before the Alaska Court of Veterans' Appeals.
In January 2016 he was charged with assault, engaging in a crime against a person, and using a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the case.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was reported missing by veterans in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was linked to PTSD that began with his tour of duty in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: more than 100 dead
At least 384 people have died as a quake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck in the small outskirts of central Sulawesi which is the eastern and northern part of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Video footage of the public squat showed when it collapsed.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami struck the shore.
Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for a suspect in the NYC terror war.
New York prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terror attack in New York that killed eight people -- a rare punishment in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was charged with using a Home Depot-branded truck to commit the crime on a bicycle path along West Highway in Lower Manhattan, and with assaulting pedestrians and cyclists on his path on Oct. 1.
To show why the death penalty is justified, the prosecution will show that Saipov  wilfully killed eight people and  wilfully injured many people, and by a willful act to seek the death penalty, was charged by the Southern District of New York.
Both charges could carry the death penalty, by court order.
In the weeks following the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts including eight counts of murder-for-hire, which federal grand juries often use in felony cases, as well as charges of violence and vehicular damage.
The raid required "thorough planning and deliberation", the judges said, and described Saipov's conduct as "disgusting, ugly and abusive".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, torture, and destruction to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement of purpose said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York held a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of two murders and drug trafficking but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in New York's city hall was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a murdered couple convicted of conspiring to commit treason against the Soviet Union during its two-year Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of humanity in the days and months following the attack, which court documents show.
He told investigators that he was sorry for what he had done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, which the allegation showed.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag inside his hospital, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the city's public defenders and Saipov's attorney, said they were "deeply disappointed" with the decision of the court.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a plea of guilty to life in prison with no possibility of parole will only increase the fear of the events for all those affected", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has already begged the judges to stop seeking the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be included in the Brexit package
Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the army of the people today during a Tory rally.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "take the heat" from the Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's MPs compared her to the EU's "head of the line".
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told a crowd in Birmingham that the UK would be left if Mr Farage was the Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May's struggle to re-unite her divided party is a mistake as Tory supporters joined a separate protest to block Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers deal in line amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and EU supporters.
The coalition insisted it would continue to try to reach a deal with Brussels despite the criticism - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and the "conflict".
Mr Bone told a Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull that he wanted to quit Chequers.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made a member and given a job for the organ in the centre of Brussels.
"If he is in the head, we should get out now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP posted: I will stand up for Brexit but we should lose the Chequers.
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: We did not fight the world to be obedient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Boone dismissed suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: The notion that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is simply not true.
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, telling reporters: I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Most of the public does not like Chequers, Opposition will not vote for it, our political parties and activists do not like it, who are marching in the streets to ensure that we are elected.
Please stop Chequers and start listening.
In her address Mrs May said: Prime ministers postpone their work when they have made their promises.
Mr. Farage told the assembly that the candidates should get the heat if they want to overturn the decision in the 2016 election.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political party", he said.
They are trying to avoid Brexit but we are here today to tell them we will not leave you if you do that
In a message to the rallying crowd he said: I want you to make sure our political team, who are on the verge of Brexit, feel the heat.
We rally the mass forces of this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we are also a United Kingdom of freedom, self-government, and dignity.
On the other hand, the Remainers traveled through Birmingham before the convention and spent two hours at the city's flagpole.
A small rally of Tory and Brexit supporters has just started this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis reported to the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered from using party equipment as the council opened.
There are people who tell us that they have an IT system ready with all the technology for Canada plus, for the border and no problem, for the free and no border trade in Ireland, he added.
It was a big hat.
There is no such thing as a real Brexit, he added.
Warren is advocating for a presidential run.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would be considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a rally in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a close ally of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was a key co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
He has been in the midst of a controversy that he has to launch Trump campaign in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was the 36th gathering of the community using the synagogue format since Trump took office.
The man asked if he would run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, but that included a woman in charge.
Don't get caught with the Sims LSU network
Police in Baton Rouge, La., said Saturday that a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They uploaded the video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the same man seen in the shooting.
Sims, 20 was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims had a gunshot wound to the head, he died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde came to his friend's defense when Simpson fired at him.
Simpson was questioned, he admitted to being there, armed, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is already in the world cup as a one-off win over Sebastian Vettel is handed to him
It was clear at the time that Valtteri Bottas had voted ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday of the Mercedes team's passing of a law that would make a big impact on the race.
At the start, Bottas got off to a good start, narrowly missing Hamilton on the sand as he defended his position in the first two laps and called Vettel to hug his teammate.
Vettel entered the pit first and allowed Hamilton to go into the roadblock at the end of the group stage, which should have been the deciding factor.
Mercedes entered the pit one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a foot-and-mouth injury that caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the gap open for fear of overtaking after the push-up to make a step into the third corner.
Max Verstappen started at the back of the grid, finishing seventh in the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He continued to lead for much of the race as he held his tyres to a fast finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen in fourth.
He finally got into the pit on lap 44 but was unable to improve his pace with eight laps remaining as Raikkonen took fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri had done a wonderful job all week and was a very quiet man, as I had been told.
The same has worked extraordinarily to have the first and the second", said Hamilton.
The Language That Is So Wrong
President Donald Trump reported to Congresswoman Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not reveal the letter from Christine Blasey Ford and the family of Brett Kavanaugh who was nominated for the Supreme Court on charges of sexual assault.
Speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that the Senate's record shows that people are cruel and treacherous.
"One thing can happen and a good thing has happened in the past few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people angry, have a heart and are deceitful", he said.
When you saw the opening and closing and they said oh, I didn't do it.
I did not".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you been exposed?
Remember the answer... you opened the book - oh, oh, what?
Oh, not at all.
I am not ashamed".
Okay, wait a second.
We have exposed...No, we have not exposed", he added, the MP's mistake.
A letter explaining Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein last July, and was revealed in early September - but Feinstein denied that the revelations came from his office.
I did not accuse Dr. Ford, did not disclose his story, Feinstein told the congregation, The Hill apologized.
He asked me to arrest him secretly, I secretly arrested him as he requested.
But his denial was not kind to the president, who said at the Saturday night conference: "I'll tell you what, this is a very bad language.
He may not have done it, but that was the most outrageous language I've ever seen.
Continuing the defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual assault by three women, the president compared the Democrats to using the accusations for their own purposes.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the heartlessness, the cruelty, they don't care who they are torturing, who they have to betray to get power and control,  Mediaite kpesara the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants also
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in their Dundee game
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the return leg 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got a two-goal lead in the season from the goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie recovered to put the team back on the field before Dwyer returned the Giants' attention.
Francois Bouchard resigned for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's side who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting in the championship year between the two sides, with the Giants winning the previous three championships.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth quarter at 3:35 with a assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford brought in an assist as Beauvillier extended the lead after four minutes.
In a developmental period full of injuries, Sullivan brought the home crowd back to the field at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt was a backup for Cownie's comeback at 15:16.
Dwyer saw the Giants take the lead into the first half when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The side in the room reassembled and Bouchard again put them in a circle with a large goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the first lead in the competition in the second-half final, and he closed the scoring with his team's fifth goal in the semi-final.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
A Flight Attendant Died to See How Many Hundreds of People on Flights Were Displaced by the Earthquake
An Indonesian flight attendant is being hailed as a hero after he died when a cargo plane landed safely with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people were killed, mostly missing after a massive earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continued to affect the region, with many trapped under the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawang Agung was forced to leave his job on the control tower and power grid at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He was determined to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the way to the airport, could be flown safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought the plane was about to fall.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision had saved many lives, reported ABC News of Australia.
We chartered a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a hospital in another city.
Sadly, he left us this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
We are heartbroken to hear about this, he added.
On the other hand, officials fear that the death toll could reach thousands as the city's disaster management agency says the roads to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are blocked.
The number is believed to be still rising as many people are still under the rubble and have not been able to access the majority, said the agency's spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Palu has been hit by a six-metre storm that caused heavy damage on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in relief supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Every minute ambulances are bringing in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
There are cold shops everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
This has been a disaster, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the local soldiers: I ask all of you to work day and night to complete any project related to the mine.
Are you ready? CNN
Earlier this year an earthquake hit Indonesia and Lombok killing 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini flies a missing man after a plane crash in the sea
The crew of the plane that crashed into the sands of the Pacific in Micronesia now report that one man is missing, after initially saying that all 47 passengers and crew on the plane had been evacuated safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday afternoon, that it had not been able to locate a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as age or country.
A small regional boat assisted in the rescue of passengers and other crew members after the plane crashed in the water as it tried to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said that six passengers were in hospital on Saturday, and all were in good condition.
The cause of the accident as well as the exact sequence of the event are unclear.
The pilots and the U.S. Navy said the plane crashed into the shore just before it reached the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had gone over the runway.
American traveler Bill Jaynes said that planes landed small.
"That's a great thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others tried to cross the water on foot and reached the emergency exit on the plane with the plane.
He said that the flight crew were scared and screaming, and that he had a small wound on his head.
The U.S. Navy said that close to the pilot working to improve the port also helped with rescue operations by using a floating boat to lift people to the surface before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network showed that 111 people died in accidents involving PNG-registered aircraft in the past two decades but could not include Air Niugini.
Researchers have found that nighttime can save a woman's life
The jury dismissed his trial on Saturday on the appeal of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Investigator Paul Rowlett testified for many years as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told a jury how he used mobile phone records to trace the movements of accused Quinton Tellis, 29, and victim Jessica Chambers, 19, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis and Chambers were there on the night of his death, in contradiction to his last words, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that Chambers used his phone during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford sat down on the bench on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the jury asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was afraid, because of the truck I was in in Nashville.
Furthermore, Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of his death.
Telephone records show that the two had known each other for about a week.
Rowlett said shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and messages from his phone.
He erased it from his life, Hale said.
The defendants are scheduled to begin their final arguments on Sunday.
The Chief Justice said he expected the case to be referred to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop?
The hip hop trio wanted to change the negative image of the genre by infusing their music with beautiful messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has abandoned its natural political message and addressed social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make hip hop popular again.
Bands such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A NYC nanny sued a married couple for unfair employment to get a discrimination notice
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her because of her race after receiving a letter from her mother complaining that she was just another black woman.
The couple denied any involvement, claiming the case was a money grab.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her anger when she discovered that the nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black as she arrived at her first day of work in 2016.
MBAAAAAAAAAA THE FIRST DAY, Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a letter.
No, but instead of sending her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice twice.
After discovering her guilt, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that their foster mother, who is African-American, had done a bad job of keeping a Filipino baby, according to the New York Post.
She paid Ms. Maurice for a day's work and sent her home with Uber.
Now, Maurice and the couple are applying for a consolation allowance for the divorce, claiming a consolation allowance of $350 a day for six months, a homeownership arrangement that he was previously employed for, despite no written contract.
I want to show them, look, you don't do that kind of thing", he told the Post on Friday, adding I know it's racist.
The couple have denied the accusations of being racist, saying that terminating Maurice was the right thing to do, and fearing they could not trust him after upsetting him.
My wife sent him a message that she had inadvertently spoken to him about.
He is a very handsome man.
We are not racists", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you put your children in the hands of someone you have spoken badly to, even if it is in sin?
Your newborn?
Please come.
Attributing the case to money laundering, Plasco said that his wife had just given birth two months ago, and that she was in a critical condition.
WOULD you chase such a person away?
That is not necessarily a good thing to do, added the bank official.
The trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has rushed to condemn the couple for public corruption, and to criticize them for their actions and opinions.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not understand the spoken word, a new letter shows
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who finished the book immediately after it was received, said of the letter: It is difficult to put oneself in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
He's got a big laugh now and you know the great story of Paddington.
Saying that his father, who worked as a BBC photographer before getting inspired to write the children's book for the beer toy, would have a good hope that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "a delight" after his death last year.
Paddington, who described as "a very important member of our family", said that his father was proud of his eventual success.
"He is a gentle man, not a proud man", he said.
But because Paddington is so big to him, it's like having a little baby accomplished something: you're going to feel proud of them even if it's not entirely in your own strength.
I think he saw Paddington's progress along the way.
Although it was his own invention and his own will, he always praised Paddington himself.
My daughter is in the sun, and I can only contact her by phone
In the fall her daughter was transferred to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors did their best to save her life.
Nad was calling repeatedly to say that she was very badly injured, and that she was not expected to survive, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then I got a call from Nad saying that he would die in the next two minutes, and I had to tell him that.
I did.
I said, Tashi, I love you, I feel you.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The doctors' treatment of her to keep her alive was slowly and painfully draining her of her body.
He had died before, and all of that was over.
I went to the window and waited, knowing that everything was wrong.
I can't cry or scream or shed a tear because I'm surrounded by family and people.
I need to get myself together.
Eventually Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers - unaware of what she was going through.
"No one knows", he said.
My head was on the floor, and tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt a deep sadness for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.
Women mourn and postcards to stop the water supply
Two women who took their loved ones and work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys with a postcard with messages and inspiration and a phone number from the Welsh Water Authority where people can call for help.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at 18.
I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a cook and a bright, bright future.
He is known for his warm smile.
They always talk about his smile and lift every room.
However, he stopped working before he died, because he was in a very bad place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the first person to witness his brother commit suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I always thought there would be a reaction".
Mrs. Davis made the cards, to let people know that there are people here that they can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't just sit there - you have to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
He didn't say he was humble or depressed or anything.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was on the floor on Christmas Eve - when the children opened their presents and he was not caught or anything.
He said that his death was a great shock for them, but they would work together to get through it: It had created a hole in the family.
It divides us.
But we all have to keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in doubt as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I think, if we can get something like what he's asking for - a ban on early, prohibited testing - we can bring a little bit of unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears the congregation and the state will be in a political lockdown.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and the Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
The lack of interest is due to time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do not do well, then they will not have much power in their bid to get the man they want to nominate for the state's highest court.
George W. Bush is picking up the phone to call Congress, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who is Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI files a complaint?
Elections will be held in the House of Representatives, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the House of Commons, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to call his case and take it to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors decreases under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seun, referring to data from the South Korean Ministry of Communications, said there had been 1,127 breaches last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the increased border control between North Korea and China and the high costs of smuggling were among the reasons.
Pyongyang has not yet made any public statements.
Many of the North Korean defectors are granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing from China, which has the longest land border between North Korea and is still easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the defectors to be more of a criminal than a refugee and has returned them in a fit of rage.
Relations between the North and the South - still at odds - have seen a dramatic improvement in recent months.
Earlier this month, officials from both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the possibility of a nuclear test.
This came after the June summit between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on a broad agenda to work together on Korean territorial waters and nuclear disarmament.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and in such conditions, there is no way we can be a consistent medium to disarm our weapons", Mr Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh 'crazy', said he was not old enough to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nominee "a fool" and said he was too hot to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman did something like that, they would say she's crazy", Pelosi said of her influence in Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has bitterly denied the allegations that he assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the announcement of his development, Kavanaugh's mood was very high, sometimes he wanted to scream but the voice was overwhelming as he talked about his family and his college years.
He also told Democrats at the conference explicitly, that the allegations against him were "a gross violation of the integrity of the process", a move that was widely seen by the opposition as a provocation to Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court, as it showed his dislike for Democrats.
He said, "I think he has exaggerated himself by using those words and in the way he has criticized the Clintons and the Democrats",
Pelosi was relieved when asked if she would be willing to remove Kavanaugh if he was appointed, if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only not fit to serve on the Supreme Court, but you're in the court he's on right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is the chief judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said as a Democrat that she was concerned about whether Kavanaugh's campaign would be for the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it was seen as a radical and anti-change measure.
In an effort to put him in his place, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn some Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a crazy, crazy person to go to court and expect us to say, 'That's not right,'" Pelosi said.
The Bible - A Book for Women.
It is a legitimate criticism, month and year old anger and rage, it cannot be said that it has not been brewed.
"We are crying when we are angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think this is new, is what you think?
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was the president of a place, who said that she herself cried when she was angry, but she learned a way that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I was sad because I was crying.'
I was angry and angry.
Then he would move on.
I thought that was beautiful.
Tears are accepted as a form of relief from anger on the one hand because of its clear understanding.
One of my fondest memories was of my early work, a men's department, where I found myself in a place of great anger, being pulled behind my back by an old woman - a cold manager whom I was afraid of - who took me to the upstairs room.
Don't let them see you in bed, he told me.
They don't know how angry you are.
They think you're sad, they'll be happy because they have you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked for Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested for having an affair on the Monkey Business, he left the race, and Ms. Schroeder, in a fit of rage, found there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
It wasn't a well thought out idea, he told me 30 years later.
There are already seven other candidates in the race, and they don't want another one.
Someone called it  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because he was late with the ad, he was behind in saving money, so he vowed not to enter the race unless he got $2 million.
It is a battle that is bound to be won.
He noticed that some of his sponsors had given $1,000 to men who had given him only $250.
Do you think I can get a discount? she considered.
When she made her statement that she would not launch a full-scale campaign, she was filled with a huge heart - grateful for the people who supported her, angry at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters rather than representatives, and angry at the sexism - she was deeply moved.
You might think I was very scared, Ms. Schroeder recalled how the journalists found out about it.
You might think that Kleenex is a corporation that supports me.
I remember thinking, what will be put on the stone in my tomb?
Is he crying?
How a US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The initial outbreak of a trade war between the US and China has been overshadowed by a long-running dispute, and the division between the two countries could present a future disadvantage for Beijing, experts said.
Donald Trump, US President, first warned earlier this year by imposing tariffs on Chinese exports including solar panel, steel and aluminium.
The most significant stimulus came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, and imposing tariffs on half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has done the same every time, recently imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on US $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to embrace the US as well, and the world's second largest economy cannot be ignored anytime soon.
To appease Washington means to agree to the demands, but to publicly humiliate the US would be a great embarrassment for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts still insist that if Beijing plays its cards right, the US trade war could favour China in a positive way in the future by reducing trade between the two economies.
"The failure of a hasty political decision in Washington or Beijing could create a situation in which the economic crisis within the same two countries is more dangerous than what the experts had previously agreed", said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, advisors.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria said it was in favor of the return of refugees on their own, and called for help in rebuilding the city that had been devastated by more than seven years of fighting.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
He said the situation in the country is better and safer, thanks to the progress made in preventing the spread of the virus.
The government is continuing to rebuild the areas damaged by the earthquake to restore the status quo.
All the conditions are now in place for the return of refugees to their homelands because of the poverty and economic values of the targeted communities and their living and working conditions.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the countryside and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would accept help and rebuild the devastated city.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional or foreign aid to support the uprising.
Europe holds the Ryder Cup title in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16:5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The US has lost three times against Europe, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as one of Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
US legend Phil Mickelson, who had a lot of problems in the tournament, threw his ball in the water and hit a 3-for-16 to lose his tournament to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has done well throughout his career, being a 1-on-4 player to go 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5-4 to the youngest player and European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 to England's Ian Poulter who was able to play in his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of the Ryder Cups, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia is the most successful European in the tournament, having averaged 25.5 points over his career.
I don't usually cry but today I couldn't stop.
It was a difficult year.
I thank Thomas for nominating me and accepting me.
I was thrilled and excited to have the cup again.
It was for the team. I am happy that I could contribute, " Garcia said with great enthusiasm in the European victory.
He handed the ball over to fellow countryman John Ram who had beaten US golfer Tiger Woods 2-1 in a one-on-one match on Sunday.
"My pride, beating Tiger Woods, I watch the man grow up", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Wood lost all four of his matches in France, and now has a 13-21-3 record for the Ryder Cup record.
The fight and the surprise of one of the greatest players of all time, having won 14 major trophies second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all week to find the past except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain US Jim Furyk commented after having a game that was not good for his team, "I have a lot of pride in these guys, they fought hard.
There was a time this morning when we were hot for Europeans.
We failed.
Thanks to Thomas.
He was a good captain.
All 12 musicians played their instruments to a perfect standard.
We will reorganize, and I will work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Association, and we will move forward.
I loved these 12 men, and I was proud to serve as captain.
You will be humbled.
We have been very successful.
Water supply upgrades: Decreased flooding in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest complaint from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in freshwater harvesting for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
From the FWC, the peanut infestation is reported in the small communities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collies - which includes the rolling down.
The Yellow River floodplain stretches some 130 miles of shoreline from the mountainside of Pinellas to the south of the small town of Lee.
Fragments can be seen in about 10 miles of waterfront Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
The water of the river has also been found in Pasco County.
Half of the landslides were detected in or near the waters of Pinellas County last week, the low to high waterfalls of Hillsborough County, the low to high waterfalls of Manatee County, the low to high waterfalls of Sarasota County, the low to high waterfalls of Charlotte County, the low to high waterfalls of Lee County, and the low waterfalls of Collier County.
Abortion abuse is still reported in the towns of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
Respiratory distress was not reported in the Northwest Florida area over the past week.
