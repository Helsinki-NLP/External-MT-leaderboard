Welsh AMs worried about 'how to behave like a fool'
There is a risk of risk among some AMs over the decision to change their status to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The incident was sparked by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Assembly.
Political parties are concerned about the potential for ridicule.
An AM of the Labour Party said the party was concerned "with the Twp and the Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means madness and pwp means bone.
A Plaid AM commented that the group as a whole "didn't feel comfortable" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh commentator said the band had nothing in mind about changing the name, but noted a brief comment from MWP to Muppet.
In this case, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same as the Yorshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the bill to propose the name changes, said: The final decision on any material disclosure of what the members of the Assembly are called will be a matter for the members themselves.
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gives the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that received the most support for calling the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the naming of the AMs, the Commission favoured Welsh Members of Parliament or WMPs, but the MWP's choice received the most support in a public debate.
Apparently the AMs are suggesting other options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could be tough for the Superintendent General, Elin Jones, who is expected to draft a bill on the changes within weeks.
The bill on the changes will include other changes to the way the council works, including provisions on deciding the disqualification of AMs and regulating the structure of the council.
The AMs will have the final vote on the issue of what they will be called when they pass the bill.
Macedonians go to vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to Republic of North Macedonia.
The famous election was held in an attempt to resolve an annual dispute with Greece's neighbor, whose own province is called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a territorial claim and has repeatedly refused to seek membership in the European Union and NATO.
The President of the Republic of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, a vocal opponent of the direct election system on the name change, has said he will withdraw the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is a necessary step toward joining the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Silenced Because of the Harlem Synagogues in the Middle of a War
"Historically, the old men I spoke to said there was a bar and a synagogue on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, none of them exist.
He said that the loss of the drunkard is understandable.
People are having a different kind of fun these days, the machine is.
Alcoholic beverages are no longer just a bunch of rooms where people go one-on-one.
As for the churches, he was concerned that the money from selling the properties would not be as quick as the leaders expected, and would soon or later return if they started.
He added that synagogues and apartment buildings would be replaced with large, crowded halls that would not serve other refugee shelters.
"Most of the people who will buy the larger buildings will be white", he said, "so they will hasten the date when these synagogues will be declared completely closed because there is a possibility that most of these people who moved into these larger buildings will become members of these synagogues".
Both synagogues were built by whites before Harlem became a black community - the Community of the City in 1870, ten years after St. Martin's.
The white Methodist movement originated in the 1930s.
A group of black worshippers who worshiped nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a group of devout blacks under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the merchants to move even shopping to line 125, a major shopping street in Harlem, which was committed to hiring or sponsoring blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as the reconstruction was being planned, the orchestra was opened by the followers of Father Johnson.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Rev. Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the church's musical instruments "the bells of the common people".
The expert who sounded the alarm in July called it something different: A treasured cultural treasure and An irreplaceable historical relic.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also notes that it was the world's first instrument played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved a large orchestra at Riverside Hall 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What appeared at St. Martin's a few months ago turned out to be a confusing story of designers and contractors, some brought in by uneducated church leaders, others by the authority of an Episcopal bishop.
The vestry committee - the administrative body of the synagogue's boundary area, which included uneducated clergy - then wrote to the archbishop in July with their concerns that the synagogue's boundary area would seek to transfer the cost to the vestry committee, even though the vestry committee was not allowed to hire designers hired by the synagogue's boundary area contractors.
Some followers complained about the lack of transparency in the area surrounding the synagogue.
A 13-year-old lobster hunter in California is injured by a giant whale
A giant sea fish attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while hunting for a losbter in California on the opening day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming and he went to the scene with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel says that at first he thought it was a pleasure to catch a loser, but then he realized that he was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
I was bitten!
His shoulder was completely open, said Hammel who saw it when he reached the boy.
I shouted for everyone to come out of the water. Hammel added, "There is a big fish in the sea!
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of giant sea fish that attacked are unknown.
Life-saving captain Larry Giles told reporters that a giant sea fish had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that the giant fish was not from another species.
Giles added that the victim felt severe injuries to the upper part of his back.
Officials closed access to the coast from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for exploration and protection purposes.
Giles noted that there were more than 135 species of giant fish in the area, but most were not considered to be endangered.
Sainsbury's preparing to enter the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's carries Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams along with the same parts of the fashion store that are hired by its staff and professional assistants.
As part of the £2.8 billion British cosmetics market, which continues to grow despite a decline in home decor and furniture sales, the main cosmetics components will be tested in 11 stores across the country and taken to more stores next year if the deal is successful.
Investment in the fashion industry is coming as supermarkets struggle to make way for the once-blank space of televisions, kitchen appliances and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its cosmetics line to nearly 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have the same range of sizes as those available in stores like Boots.
The supermarket will also re-launch its line of trendy products so that most products are vegan-friendly - something that is gaining increasing demand from smaller retailers.
In addition, perfume maker Perfume Shop will test offerings at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening in Croydon, south London, last week and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to smaller daily purchases at local convenience stores means that it is imperative that large retailers make efforts to attract people to visit.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury's, said that side stores will continue to be like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with discount retailers Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos side stores in hundreds of stores as well and has introduced several Habitats since it bought out their entire lineup two years ago, which it says has further improved the food chain and made the acquisition more profitable.
Efforts by a major retailer to revive the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals industry have been unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tried a business partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger came to an end after a dispute over how to divide the revenues from the pharmacy into its own supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
He said Llyods would play a role in the plan, adding an expanded line of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, marketing director of Sainsbury's said: "We have changed the look and feel of the cosmetic parts to improve the experience for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained colleagues who will be close by to offer advice.
Our range of styles is designed to fit every need and the attractive atmosphere and simple facilities mean a destination for an attractive boutique that challenges the old fashioned way of shopping.
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby pulled out of £11 million contract
Dragons star Den Peter Jones goes 'in a rage' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby quits her £11 million contract and her business-style lifestyle to move on to her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby had no time for their household chores and Truly's kind of supportive nature.
Their business was linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of the program This Morning, 37, took to Instagram where she announced she would be leaving.
Holly Willoughby leaves the Dragons" Den star Peter Jones angrily says she's out of their lucrative business model at the end of the season - to face her new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Sources say Jones was "outraged" when the TV star confirmed during a heated debate on Tuesday at his flagship business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth £1.5 million - meant she now had little time to waste on household chores and Truly's brand of sponsorship.
The deal was linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was said to have attracted a doubling of Willoughby's fortune estimated at £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce she was leaving Truly, Jones boarded a plane and passed one of his holiday homes.
One foot says: Truly is at the top of Holly's list of priorities.
It will be a longer cycle than it will in some years to come.
The resulting sentence leaves all in the picture in a state of shock.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, as the dedication was nearing.
There is a large warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters that are ready to be sold.
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most popular stars, will cost the company millions due to excessive investment in products from pillows to candles to clothing and home furnishings, and possible delays in its launch.
And he would give the final interpretation through a long-time friend.
The mother of three, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, took over as chairman in March.
The couple often vacationed together and Jones owned a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an ambassador for a brand for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on his business affairs".
The main point and that's when we started dating
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unsuitable for the president" and for seeing something positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trump said in his voice that he was "a bad newsman".
I have left nothing.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second round of talks after their first one in Singapore in June which Trump hailed as a major step toward reducing North Korea's nuclear arsenal.
But the nuclear arms reduction agreements have failed.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not seen a "response" from the United States to the North's initiated arms reduction efforts.
On repeated occasions, he noted, the United States continued to impose sanctions with the intention of continuing pressure.
Trump took a view he felt was possible in his rally speech.
"Everything is going well for us with North Korea", he said.
We would start a war with North Korea.
Millions would have been killed.
And now we have this great bond.
He said his efforts to improve contacts with Kim had produced positive results - ending the missile tests, helping to free the hostages and getting the rest of the bodies of US soldiers home.
And he defended his way a bit in his speech and interaction with Kim.
"It's easy to be a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded place, we're going to have about 200 people here", Trump said, pointing directly at the crowd in front of him.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy Island, Hundreds of People Killed
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, international NGOs were told that they were no longer needed.
Despite the fact that nearly 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national emergency has been declared, a condition that would attract international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international help, so it is a minor challenge", Ms Sumbung said.
When Save the Children was organizing a mission to Palu, it was not sure if the foreign workers could work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Transportation Agency, said Indonesian officials were monitoring the situation in Palu to see if international delegations would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia has seen on a regular basis, the country has become severely unprepared for life in disaster.
Although tsunami-proof buildings were constructed in Aceh, they were not visible in coastal areas.
The lack of a tsunami warning in Palu, although a warning was in effect, may have contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of times, navigating between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
The divinely appointed assemblies made the distribution of material necessities very difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok was on its way to Palu to treat victims, but it would take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo turned Indonesia's damaged infrastructure into a focus of his election campaign, and he invested heavily in roads and railways.
But a lack of funds plagued Mr. Joko's government when he ran for re-election the following year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from sectarian violence and anti-communist warfare, where the predominantly Muslim monarchy has adopted a form of radical religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using mortars, spears, bows, and other deadly weapons.
The picture: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool has drawn a horse against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge defended Liverpool from a Premier League challenge cup game where they lost to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards out of a 1-0 loss to Chelsea with his teammates following.
He touched the ball to his left before striking another long-range shot.
The attempt to climb over the box by descending to the top right corner of the staircase.
Finally the ball fell on the skipper Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the hole.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com that It was just another attempt to get in that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to create for myself as much time as possible.
I saw Kante coming and he touched once and I didn't think much about it so I just hit him.
Chelsea were 1-0 up at the start of the half after scoring another goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues' attacking midfielder again passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before he ran into the middle of the field and kicked a goal into Liverpool's half.
Immediately Kovacic made a gesture and ran across the middle of the field.
He then made another good hit, pushing Hazard into the box.
Hazard passed the goalkeepers and finished in the position of a fast-medium goalkeeper with a left foot where he passed Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool faced Napoli in the group stage of the Challenge League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will also play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League Challenge Cup at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll increased to 832
The death toll in the Indonesian earthquake has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said earlier Sunday.
The result was a massive landslide that destroyed the remains of buildings and caused a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit on Friday and caused a 20-degree tidal wave, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a press conference.
Palu, a city of over 380,000, is a rubble pile of ruined bridges.
Police arrested a man, aged 32, on suspicion of murder by stabbing
An investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old man was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police were looking for people in the area who had seen or heard something to report.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages but I would call on anyone around John's Line in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything he does not believe to contact us.
I will also call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken pictures on the front camera to contact us so that they may have information that is of interest to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found dead was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in a building.
Later that afternoon, believing friends who knew the woman went to the scene to ask questions about where she had been that morning.
The investigation is ongoing as the police say they are preparing to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his home but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he realized what had happened.
Residents were told that it would be a few hours before they could return.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the whole area was considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared there, tears in her eyes.
She kept repeating A horrible thing.
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon two police cars collided with only one truck outside.
Some officers stood in the middle of the massacre and inspected the area of the houses.
Anyone with information to send via DM @MerPolCC, is requested to call 101 or contact Crime Prevention in private on 0800 555 111 using the 247 directory reference as of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell's Parliamentary Palace became the latest monument to the "historical rewriting crisis"
Green will be held accountable for the same style of British historical, cultural and religious destruction as the Taliban did to their radical followers.
But the Cromwellian community described Mr Crick's proposal as "a foolish attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell in Westminster Palace will be the object of attack.
Attacking the landmarks of the English Civil Wars was not Cromwell's order to do or to do.
Perhaps the most tragic thing to come out of Cromwell's head was the work of his grandfather Thomas a century earlier.
There is a large body of information about Cromwell's William Hamo Thorneycroft being the 19th-century proof of hypothesis and part of the historical record of a figure that most believe should still be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: Many people regarded Cromwell, perhaps more so in the last decades of the 19th century than today, as the defender of Parliament from external pressure, in the inevitable crisis of monarchy.
Whether that explanation would be anything at all accurate is a matter of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the upheaval of the mid-17th century reversed the subsequent prosperity of our country, and Cromwell was a prominent figure who represented one aspect of that upheaval.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and remembered.
A Chinese Farmer Is Stuck With a Pig Stink
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in south-western China, according to reports from local media.
The man was identified only by his nickname "Yuan", who was found in a woman with a severed neck vein, all covered in blood near a stall in a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer arranged to inject pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining and Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly gang-raped his brother from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his brother found the woman, and he saw a door to a neighboring pigsty open.
He said that in the stove was a large male pig with blood on its mouth.
A scientific study of the incident confirmed that 550-pound pigs crushed the farmers to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were soaked in blood and curved, and my cousin referred to his nickname as Wu machine it, as reported by Guiyang Evening News".
Video from the security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 am on Thursday to deliver food to his relatives.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A store manager told Evening News that the pig was covered to prevent him from attacking another person, while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
It was reported that Yuan's family and the market authorities were in talks to pay compensation for his death.
Although rare, examples of pig attacks on humans have been seen in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man in serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig chased a Welsh farmer into his tent until his wife threatened the animal and it ran away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pigs were not quite as aggressive but the taste of blood could be something to do with the song.
They were just playing.
They are contagious, curious... they are not out to hurt.
You just have to respect them properly", he said.
The remnants of Rosa will cause heavy rains for the southwest United States
As predictions indicate, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves through the cold waters of the Mexican coast.
Rosa, however, will cause severe flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 miles per hour, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was seen 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa was expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a tidal wave began to form over the Pacific Ocean where it moved eastward to the West Coast of the United States.As Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a major hurricane it would begin to push the heat wave northward into the southeastern United States.
Rosa will produce up to 10 inches (10 cm) of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the heat wave combines with the opposing waterfall to create a downpour that will reach a wide area in the southwest in the coming days.
Inland, 1 to 14 inches of rain would cause severe flooding, landslides and possible landslides in the desert.
The extreme heat waves can produce rainfall estimates of 2 to 3 inches per hour in the areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
There is a possibility of flooding due to the continuous and severe climate damage caused by the rainfall in the tropics.
It is a bad idea to go out into the wilderness and face the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rains can cause tidal flows to become torrential rivers and floods can produce dust and dust clouds.
The approaching monsoon will bring heavy local rainfall to parts of the Southern California coast.
There is a possibility of a total rainfall of more than one inch, which will cause little debris flow and smooth traffic routes.
This would be the first rain of their winter season in the province.
A tropical downpour will begin to hit Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more concentrated late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
October may see a severe reversal of the climate across the United States as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics will remain warm.
Sometimes this will lead to dramatic changes in the weather over short periods of time.
There was another major example of dramatic weather variation across the central United States on Sunday.
There is a difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the heat of summer will try to build up and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to see a warm start in October with the 80s drifting from the Southern Hemisphere to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could experience a temperature of 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is at least 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of moderate weather for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's speech
More than 20 million people watched the arresting testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman suing him over alleged sexual abuse that took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political turmoil continued, with the media interrupting the regular schedule for a late Friday shift: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had caught her drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a dismissive testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that the incident did not happen.
Not surprisingly, more than 20.4 million people watched the Nielsen report.
The company calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate demographics for other networks that aired the episode, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring the people they watch in their offices.
To put it bluntly, that's like the audience size of a football game where you win the Academy Awards.
Fox News, which was heavily supported by commentators, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing and throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest was high after the hearing.
Flake is the most popular center in the Friday night lineup.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would nominate Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras showed him on Friday shouting at protesters as he attempted to climb a lift to the upper floor of the meeting place of the Committee on the Judiciary.
He stood staring at the ground for several minutes during the screaming, broadcast on CNN television.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he is being honest with the country?
She was told, "You have all the strength when many women were weak".
Flake said that his office had released some information and that, before the intercom closed, he had much to say in the committee's discussion.
Cable networks and broadcasters all broadcast the episode at a later time, when the Legislative Committee voted to push Kavanaugh's name to the full Senate for another vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would be looking into the suspect next week, who is a minority Democrat.
Flake was briefly satisfied with a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with the Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was strong, because it was clear that Republicans would not get votes to approve Kavanaugh without a referendum.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh scandal.
British Prime Minister May criticizes Brexit critics for being politically biased
Prime Minister Theresa May has criticized critics of her plans to leave the European Union and "turning politics" into the future of Britain and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In a follow-up interview to the one on the front page of the paper, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson lashed out at his own Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a resolution that Britain and the European Union should accept mutual funds was "totally untrue".
Wayde Sims shooting Police arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of the murder of an LSU player.
Police arrest a suspect in the fatal shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken into custody on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the argument between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a WAFB report linked to CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he pleaded guilty to Wayde's fatal shooting.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to Advocate's report.
The East Baton Rouge Causes of Death Investigation Office released an initial report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that went through the neck.
The department commended Louisiana State Police officers who worked to apprehend the fugitive, the state's Criminal Investigation Police Department, and Southern University police and local residents for assisting in the investigation that led to the killing.
LSU jumping director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement for their "dedicated work to ensuring justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and a rebounding score of 2.6 in one of the previous seasons.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team had been "shocked and shaken" by Wayde's death.
"This is what a person is worried about all the time", Wade said.
A massive volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Smoke from the massive Popocatepetl volcano has reached neighborhoods in the south of Mexico City.
The National Coalition Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after the eruption peaked and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded for more than 24 hours.
The center monitors tornadoes and earthquakes.
Images on social media showed thick ashes rolling over car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Meteorologists have observed additional activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano "Don Goyo" has been erupting since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the independence march
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined anti-riot protests to celebrate the ballot-day that divided Catalonia over the dismantling.
A group of blindfolded protesters held by police sprayed them with beans and sprayed them with paint powder, creating a dark cloud in the streets that are often crowded with tourists.
Fighting broke out the next day when the police used their controls to stop the fight.
For more than several hours the pro-democracy mobs responded with "No forgetting, no forgiveness" they clashed with the protesters "The pro-integrationists shouted, God forbid Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Violence still rages in the province that has cemented independence a year after the October 1 referendum that Madrid considers illegal but is being cheered on by Catalan separatists.
Voters did well in elections where they chose Independence although not so well where those who did not want to be disqualified did not vote.
According to Catalan authorities, at least 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop voting at polling stations across the province amidst violent protests.
Mobs of pro-independence protesters lined up outside at night in support of the National Police.
The argument continued but she was forced to take a different course.
Narcis Termes, 68, a lawyer who participated in the pro-independence protests with his wife, said he did not expect Catalonia to become independent.
Last year we lived through one of our best times.
I watched my parents cry for the right to vote but now we are stuck in it, he said.
Despite achieving a significant even marginal victory in the regional elections last December, the pro-independence Catalan parties have struggled to keep up this year's campaign with many of their prominent leaders either seeking asylum or being detained awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and their subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who takes protests in support of the police on his phone, said the violence was fueled by politicians on all sides.
"It's getting more and more dirty", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan presidents detained pending trial since the end of last year, announced that he would stand for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reject the regression in democratic values and tyranny we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after carjacking at home
Two men, aged 33, 34 and 29, were arrested after a minivan was broken into a house in Londonderry.
It happened in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 BST.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the doors and even his own home were damaged.
The car may also have been shot at by a bow and arrow.
Menga's win gave Livingston a 1-0 win against the Rangers
The success of Dolly Menga brought Livingston to success
Livingston's elevated form surprised the Rangers by saving Steven Gerrard just one game to his second win in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack was a factor as Gary Holt's side moved the flat with Hibernian in the second leg.
Gerrard's side are without a win in the Premiership this season and will face Leaders Hearts, who are trailing by eight points, next Sunday.
Earlier, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livinsgton, have increased their unbeaten position in the county to six games, with head coach Holt still to taste the beat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost control of their uninvited visitors
The Holt team should have been ahead of the game, with their own setup causing Rangers a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson entered but pulled his attempt through the face to victory, only for Alan Lithgow to face his attempt after landing to meet the drunken defeat of Craig Halkett.
The hosts agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could put the visitors on a hard line.
And that is how the important meal was held.
The Rangers agreed to a no-hitter and Livingston worked a second chance, combined by Declan Gallagher and Robinson to design Menga, who hit and scored from the center of the box.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the ball-holding but found the home defense would not allow a pass and catcher Liam Kelly was also completely unconcerned.
This situation continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced another save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unable to get a chance from Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow opened well from a play designed by Livingston.
Then the punches were thrown around the Livingston box where the argument was continued, in which the punch was taken from the head to the goal - after Halkett challenged him to replace Glenn Middleton, and one for touching the hand - where he was knocked out.
Shocked from Livingston - study
Alasdair Lamont Scotland in the territory of Tony Macaroni
Another amazing game and reward for Livingston.
To one man, they were so impressive, continually exceeding expectations on this celestial object.
Their style of playing with the staff has changed somewhat since their return to the top, but the main credit should go to Holt and the way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He has many mighty ones.
Captain Halkett prepared, having arranged a good defense, at a time when Menga had Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their feet completely.
The Rangers are almost discouraged, almost.
Despite their good looks in the times under Gerrard, they failed to achieve such consistency.
Their final shot was not enough - they only cut the edge of the building once open - and it was another refreshing call for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a kind of reception in Cologne
Varied smiles and blue skies were seen on Saturday (September 29) when the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
On its final day President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which was designed to repair ties between NATO allies.
They have found disagreements on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's membership in the European Union.
Erdogan then went on to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a public forum of about 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters appeared nearby to see their leader.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - mostly Kurds - have expressed their disapproval of Erdogan's resolutions and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The bells of the place depict the separation of the arrival of a visitor who is hailed by the German Turks as a hero and the puppet as a deceiver by the others.
Deptford road accident: Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a minivan in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy thoroughfare in Deptford, in the southeast part of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
This was months after a cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Road, about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man who informed his relatives.
Roads were closed and buses diverted, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six officers were injured in the violence at a high-security men's prison, the Prison Office said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
The "Tornado" was brought in to deal with the riot, which involved eight prisoners and was reduced to one section.
The officer was treated for facial injuries at the scene.
According to a spokesperson for the Prison Department: Specialised trained staff have been deployed to deal with an incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six crew members were treated for injuries.
We do not expect any violence in our prisons, and they have stated that those involved will be sent and there is a possibility of a long time behind bars.
The HMP Long Lartin held over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison warden had been hospitalized after being assaulted by a fellow prisoner.
And in October last year the riot police put down a horrific violence in which workers were attacked with footballs.
Hurricane Rosa Threats to Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and Rising Floods (Wetlands may be affected)
It is rare for a heat wave to hit Arizona, but that is what is likely to happen early next week as the remaining strength of Hurricane Rosan trails across the Southeastern Desert, where it is creating a threat of rising floods.
The National Weather Service has already released observational data on rising flooding for Monday and Tuesday for Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a route over Phoenix on Tuesday, pushing through late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a Twitter post that only ten major wind events have produced a tropical storm or low point within 200 miles of Phoenix since the 1950s!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The most recent National Hurricane Center models predicted 2 to 4 inches of rain, with about 6 inches of rain not included in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are not surprising to find 1 to 2 inches with a non-contact total of as much as 4 inches as possible.
For those not in danger of a coming flood, Rosa's rains may have been a mercy since the area was plagued by drought.
Although flooding is a major concern, some of this rainfall will be beneficial since the South-East is now experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Control Board, only over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest type, weather.com reports.
First, Rosa's path was to pass through the Baja California peninsula of Mexico and fall to the ground.
Rosa, still a powerful hurricane Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving at 12 miles per hour.
The stomach meets the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean and then descends.
Therefore, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico at the height of the summer solstice and midday or evening on Monday.
Not surprisingly, rainfall in parts of Mexico has become excessive, creating a risk of widespread flooding.
A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to southwest Sonora, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then follow north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as the heat wave subsides, where it will then follow up through Arizona and into southern Itah late Tuesday night.
"The most likely threat from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest", said the National Hurricane Center.
This water is expected to produce flooding and precipitation in the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three other children and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found with injuries in the Excelsior Park area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he was in a critical condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon by Somerset Police.
Officials asked anyone who might have a mobile phone recording of the incident to come.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered, been hurt, and angered by the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the uncomfortable and overly aggressive policies of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered the unrelenting, angry reaction of the Democratic Party by pushing his name.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, loudly and angrily denying a rumor from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually abused her many years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her invention.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's skill and greatness and courage that day".
"A single vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh West is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished jurists alive in our time, a jurist with an outstanding written record of public service", West Virginia supporters said on social media.
The president made a brief comment about Kavanaugh's name pushing while talking about the benefits of the Republican primary in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important decisions of our lifetimes.
I will not stop, but I will actually stop", he said.
That's why I'm everywhere fighting for the top candidates.
Trump in the Democratic debate is on a policy of anti-burka.
The first major step toward a Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake in Indonesia, and more dead
At least 384 people were killed, including civilians, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in Palu city on Friday as waves of high waves (height 18) hit the beach at night, washing away many dead and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat hit, people were busy on the coast and did not immediately flee to the affected areas", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, said in a brief press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami came by itself, dragging small cars, buildings, houses, and hitting everything on the ground", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open ocean at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before landing on the coast.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the accident agency showed buildings and shops in ruins, a bridge bent and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The previous storms that had struck the coastal city on Saturday continued.
Earthquakes have been felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Atomic Energy Commission (BPPT) in a statement said the magnitude of the earthquake released on Friday was nearly 200 times the magnitude of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The atmosphere of the city, which sits at the end of a small, long gorge, may have contributed to the magnitude of the tsunami, the engine.
Nugroho described the damage as "extreme" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were all destroyed.
The bodies of the victims were found lying in a ditch under the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage would increase sharply along the coastline 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu, a region known as Donggala.
Communications were completely stalled and there was no news from Donggala, jinji Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers have reached the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse", she said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not announcing a tsunami would hit Palu, although officials said the waves came within the time the warning was issued.
A video shared on social media by a non-professional can be heard of a man from the roof of a building shouting a tsunami warning to people in the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water collapsed on the shore, sweeping away buildings and small cars.
Reuters news agency could not immediately verify the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages and communications disruptions in the Palu area where it caused difficulties for the authorities in coordinating the rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo and relief ships from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but those evacuated are still in desperate need of food and other essential supplies.
The city's only airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Death toll from Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800
The Trouble Was Extreme.
Although World Vision staff returned to Palu City safely from Donggala, where staff were staying in the tanpole shelters set up in their office yard, they showed a certain disruptive attitude along the way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They said we saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It was a terrible thing.
Despite the fact that aid groups have launched a massive campaign to start disaster relief work, some have complained that highly skilled foreign aid workers are being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the financing, procurement and supply of foreign personnel will only begin if the testing site is declared a national disaster camp.
That has not yet happened.
"It is still a flat disaster area", said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, Okay, this will be a national disaster, we will open for international aid but no position yet.
As the second night fell on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the victims were hoping that their loved ones would become miracles that would bring to life the sad stories of the earthquake.
On a Sabbath, a young boy was pulled out of a garbage dump.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under a bomb for two days with her mother's body nearby.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Ski Team, trained the two missing Asian Games athletes, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
The rest of those who were stabbed at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a veteran in the sport of downhill, I also share the shortcomings I feel", he said.
Mr. Gendon explained how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse was broadcast among the ski jumping community, he sent WhatsApp messages on the streets to Palu competitors, who were participating in the beach party.
His messages, however, only produced one gray colored sign, instead of a pair of blue colored signs.
"I feel like he means not texting", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 from a refill at an ATM in Newport on the Prairie
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM in Newport on the Davao, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
A minivan driver is removing an ATM in a recreation building and planning to bring in extra cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the announcement.
While he was at work, a man came running after the Brink's employee and stole the bag of money to be delivered.
Eyewitnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene of the crime according to the announcement, but police did not specify how many were inside.
Anyone with information about their testimony should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper changes his name - to Ye.
Announcing the name change via Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: I used to be known as Kanye West.
Nicknamed Ye for West, the 41-year-old has for some time also used the moniker for the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He is replacing singer Ariana Grande on the show which was cancelled for "gross cause", said the show's creator.
As it became an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious meaning to him.
I believe ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means kai, West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, we are you.
It goes from Kanye, meaning one, to the one Yes - just another symbol of our beauty, our illusion, everything.
The album is like a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that his preference was for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's other collaborator, JAY-Z, also frequently does with or without a short middle-word line and capital letters.
MEXICO'S government vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody student massacre.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to never use the military to crush Mexicans.
The military opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the center on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 at a time when socialist student activists began to find refuge in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He also said that the lack of employment and lack of educational opportunities are what attract young people to gangs.
The US should double the money A.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its spending on analytics in the field, says artificial intelligence tester Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the US government have made comments on artificial intelligence, despite the US missing a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to become the leader in AI beads by 2030.
"Reflecting AI budgets would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far behind the US and we are looking for something new in AI", Lee said.
Spending inefficiencies could double the chances of achieving the next big AI in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures China, which invests in one of the most well-known AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American player Othello, and later became a senior executive at Microsoft Research and head of Google's China division.
Lee cited previous U.S. government competitions on technology such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge where he asked when the front-end would be made, as it helped identify future telescopes.
Analysts in the United States often work hard because of government funding, Lee said.
"It is not China that employs knowledge leaders; it is corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired top academics from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said the shift in geographic focus could also help the US with its AI efforts.
"I feel my green cards should be independently issued to graduates in non-native AI intelligence", he said.
The Chinese National Congress released the Unbiased Development Plan for its Future Generation in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China has provided funding to people in academia in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund US researchers, but the quality of academic work is low in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the US Department of Defense established an Institute for Artificial Intelligence, designed to attract partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing over $100 million annually in AI research.
At the moment, the US bill seeking to create a National Security Council on Artificial Intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, in a move to resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece that has blocked its bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its border and is on the cusp of joining NATO and the European Union.
Both governments won a referendum in June on a new name they had proposed, but opposition activists argued the change would reduce the ethnic identity of the majority Macedonian Slav population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a campaign of boycotts raised doubts whether turnout would reach the 50 percent threshold needed to improve the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot reads:  NATO membership and EU membership and acceptance of the agreement with Greece.
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a sacrifice to pursue membership in institutions such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia because they can live freely under the banner of the European Union because it means a safe life for us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it lacks legal force, a number of lawmakers have vowed to follow the results of the vote to make it more equitable.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in the legislature.
The country's electoral commission said there were no reports of problems as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout stood at only 15 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the 2016 parliamentary election when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, have called for a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name to pave the way for NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia on September 3, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, staged a small demonstration and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by protesters.
"We are members of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with dignity, not through the door of work", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we are perfect.
If they don't want to consider us as Macedonia, we can turn to the rest like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian alliance.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investment to Macedonia, which has an estimated unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe a lot of people would like it because more than 80 percent of our citizens want the European Union and NATO", Zaev said after his vote.
He said that one of the consequences of eh would be the determination of our future.
A public opinion poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Resolution Studies on Monday said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than the required turnout.
A public opinion poll, by the Macedonian television station Telma, found 57 percent of respondents were preparing to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would like to throw away the eggs.
To split the debate she won the requirement of a 50% turnout and one more vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hurdle to the Western government's resolve since it took power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero goes through Brighton's defence entirely to win
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling pushed the defence of Brighton in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed a slightly humiliating performance in his own 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a kick in the middle of the field at the start of the series.
He ran through Brighton's guards, before cutting into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one guard before evading the rest on the side of the Brighton suitcase.
He then pushed another shot to his right, where he found Sterling.
The England forward used his first shot in the box to pass the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a small twist into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his form", according to City manager Pep Guardiola.
We talked about it playing for 55 minutes, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We managed to win another victory this time.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first chance in the Premier League crisis.
The meal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in Brighton's end zone very well in that game.
He sent a beautiful inside ball over the left field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few short breaks before leading Sterling to the finish line.
The Sky Blues forward only touched the ball into the goal before it went out of bounds.
City play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 pm on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena located in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a rookie with the Rockies
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force a restart.
But regular league fan Scherzer is hoping to take the Sunday series against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still only the effects of a rematch for the Rockies, who hold another game lead over the top-seeded Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies at least earned a wild card berth with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to seal their division-first position.
Even though we are playing a small game, at least we can play rubber knowing that the weather in Denver is with the public and one team will play at probably the highest level of any team I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have yet to announce a start for Sunday but are reportedly willing to let Scherzer take the heat.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, threw a big time on Thursday and will be hitting his equivalent on Sunday.
The Washington catcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump marched in West Virginia.
The president briefly mentioned the situation surrounding his nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh when he was talking about the benefits of a Republican run in the midterm elections.
Everything we did was in November.
Five weeks from now from one of the most meaningful decisions of our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big - I will not stand but I will actually stand for it because I am all over the place fighting for the local candidates, he said.
Trump continued, "You see this tragedy, this tragedy of the Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to seize power by any means they can, you see the sadness, the cruelty.
They don't want anyone they offend, who they will destroy to get power and control, so what they want is power and control, we will not give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, were on a policy of anti-prohibition.
"And you see that over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, sad, violent and unfair".
He named senior Senate Judiciary Committee member Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who was shouted out by the audience.
Do you remember the answer?
Did you tear the paper?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I was waiting for one - that's a terrible sign of dishonesty - the worst sign of dishonesty I've ever seen.
Now Labour is not a big synagogue.
Another is the impatience of those who express their feelings
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to stop me, it was no surprise.
Since I was the newest in a line of Labour MPs to be told we were not welcome - all because of the bitter feelings we had.
My friend Joan Ryan, a member of Congress, was subjected to humiliation because she was a staunch anti-Semite.
In my case, the issue of the ban was cancelled because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the benefits of a good economic policy, on national security, on Europe, unfortunately the same issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A statement for the Nottingham East Labour Conference on Friday said, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and meaningful".
For most of those eight years as a Labour member of parliament, the same was true on the night of GC meetings.
Unfortunately today, it is not a feature of many conferences and the political promise of ihsani, consciousness has already been forgotten if, indeed, it has ever been initiated.
It is becoming increasingly clear that diversity of opinion is not tolerated within the Labour Party and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became president, for colleagues who felt that we had the same political views began to suspect that I would make a revolution and take a position that I would never agree with - whether on national security or on the single market of the European Union.
I've always spoken in public - and it's not true what I've said - only then the social media scandals call for re-election, the centre-left politics are ignored, we are told that I should not be a Labour party member.
And that was not all I saw.
In fact, I knew I was better off than most of my colleagues because the orders I was given were often political.
I am a fan of the idea of the experience and commitment of these colleagues who face some kind of gender or racial discrimination every day but never run away.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this political era is the prevalence of flat-out defamation.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour party should create a culture of tolerance.
What is actually happening is that we are now giving that big synagogue any issue of "no-acceptance" or changing the electoral laws to say that the party is getting smaller.
I have received a lot of rubbish over the last couple of years called I'm quiet, don't make noise so I'll be fine.
But I did not become involved in politics.
Having joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, having been encouraged by the Thatcher government to leave the full range of schooling in decline, I thought I could become a champion of social reform for those most in need - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, even during the last election.
No one in East Nottingham would be said to have been confused about my position on resolutions and areas of dissent with the current leadership.
To those who have advertised Friday's issue, all I can say is that at a time when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and government services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and courage on its loyalty to the Labour leader.
But actually the one message I have is not to the Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve the public and I pledge that no threat of re-election or political intrigue will prevent me from working in what I believe is the best interests of the public at large.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr is in the air
Two late tests skipped the final result of some sort, but Ayr were undoubtedly well deserved to win in this spectacular Tennent Premiership game of the day.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated part of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their excellent speech, that took the edge off the house and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be pleased.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Thanks to Ayr, they took care of their own better than we did.
A 14-minute test of Anderson's run, replaced by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but, a card dance for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to make up numbers against Jason Baggot.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with another penalty, before, during the half-time break, he scored and converted a solitary try to make it 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half correctly and Patrick Anderson, replaced by Baggot, tried to cut the pass to five steps.
There was a late delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was taken on late, and the restart, Ayr pushed the top man forward through a trial by Stafford McDowall, who was replaced by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and Melrose made the man pay for another unrequited Bruce Colvine test, eventually a terrible stress attack.
The half came back, however, and when a yellow card was given to Struan Hutchinson for approaching Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson hit the ground from behind the approaching Ayr's penalty.
Climo switched, as he had done again at least from the start, after Kyle Rowe had collected David Armstrong's box-to-box hit and sent Gregor Henry away for the fifth home-side test.
Game star is still ready for a new career in the food industry
Game star Ford Kieran has also revealed plans to enter the healthcare industry after it was revealed that he was offered the position of director of a licensed food retailer.
The 56-year-old is starring as Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and co-stars with fellow comedian Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming series of nine episodes would be the last in the show's run, and revealed that Kiernan was planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the written version of the company's articles, he was a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to say anything about the story, although a Scottish Sun newspaper rumored that Kiernan was looking to enter Glasgow's thriving food market.
Our coast: landlocked Bolivia hopes court will open the way to the Pacific
Boatsmen patrol the dock of the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Government buildings are flying the blue sea flag.
Navy flags from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon with the motto: The sea is ours by right.
It is our right to return it.
In the general landlocked Bolivia, the memory of losing a coastal territory to Chile a devastating resource crisis of the 19th century is still evident - because it was the need to navigate the waters of the Pacific Ocean again.
These racial tensions are perhaps the highest in years, as Bolivia awaits a lower court ruling on October 1 after five years of heated debate.
"Bolivia has a dynamic, united and stable spirit, and it is certainly expecting a positive outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Bolivians will watch the International Criminal Court ruling on major television channels across the country, hoping that the Hague court will find a settlement to Bolivia's demand - after years of unsuccessful negotiations - that Chile agree to negotiations where it gives Bolivia access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's popular indigenous president - who faces a controversial bid for re-election next year - has a lot of prospects from Monday's ruling.
"We were about to return to the Pacific Ocean", at a rendezvous in late August.
But some pirates believe that it will be difficult for her to make her own decisions - and that nothing will change if she does.
The Netherlands-based UN Commission has no authority to assign a border to Chile, and it has made it clear that it will not decide what will be the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling comes only six months after the final hearing of the parties shows the case is not confusing, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And it is nowhere near the relief of Bolivia's legal system, which four years ago may have set it back.
"The Bolivian government is now holding back on the issue of access to the sea", Zárate said.
Morales's uncomfortable tone ended any sympathy for Chile, in her opinion.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have a conversation after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, denied that the court's decision-making process was abnormally fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia an unprecedented opportunity to open a new chapter of relations with Chile and an opportunity to bring an end to 139 years of conflict with mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most successful leaders - had used the maritime issue as a political vehicle.
He added: "Bolivia will never relinquish the right to access the Pacific Ocean.
Judgment is an opportunity to see that what happened in the past is forgotten.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come until it can trust the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his country will never give up its nuclear weapons from the start unless it trusts Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow through on the implementation of the commitments made at the summit in Singapore between the future leaders.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was about to resume talks on a successful nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore's summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was just another "dream" that continued the US's denial of a statement that ending the Korean War would bring Arewar to its knees.
Washington is hesitant to accept the statement without Pyongyang first making a significant effort to reduce its arms.
Kim and US President Donald Trump generally want a second summit.
But there is widespread disagreement that Pyongyang is not very committed to abandoning a weapon that the country sees as almost its only guarantee of security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit with Kim and Trump.
Paris jewelry show launches the latest line in your collection on its way to a Grand Titi near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat or block it completely for a day, then do not go further.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne exhibited large and elegant headwear for their SS19 line of accessories on the runway that captivated the fashion establishment at the Paris Fashion Week.
Unimaginable emotions dominated Instagram this time and these designers focused their creative eyes on the bottom of the fashion show.
Valentino's outfit was a top hat with a hairstyle that dominated the heads of the models.
Other great supports include a fancy hat, a hat and even a banana - but they are not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also came up with a surprising choice of masks - and just for the Halloween season.
Many of the colorful socks have a sewn lip and look more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One leg resembles a scuba diving kit with a snorkel and a brick, and the other resembles a tube of melting milk.
And if you keep up with the big news about fashion - you're winning.
Fashion watchers predict that large bonnets may start to appear on the main streets of your neighborhood.
The big hats go well on the long 'La Bomba' boots, a striped hat with two short sleeves seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The trend of the hat being popular on social media has been spreading to send a huge creative to a fashion show - to a beach bag almost as big as a bathing suit model.
The orange bag, decorated with the raffia-colored upper edge of a white leather marquee, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Renowned fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: I think seeing big hats and beach bags come on the main street for the next winter - because the designer has made such a big impact it will be hard to forget the need for big sponsored products.
John Edward: The importance of linguistics to the citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools maintain a documented record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a segment of the results of the most outstanding examinations, which are only encouraged by individual and collective achievement in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With an additional 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, run by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, are working to provide a flatter working environment for young children and their parents.
Boarding schools have the mission to prepare their children for further higher education, the way of life they have chosen for themselves as citizens of the world.
As a branch of knowledge that can design and implement spoken school curriculum, we see modern languages becoming increasingly familiar and a preferred subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, it goes into their head.
When you speak to him in his language it reaches his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English when we want to build relationships and friendships with people from other countries.
From the results of the recent examination of this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest scores in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received an A-level.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS school members, showed that 72 percent of the students scored an A-level in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who read German, 69 percent of those who read French and 63 percent of those who read Spanish also scored an A-level.
This suggests that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject of choice, held in the same rank as STEM (science, engineering and mathematics) courses in the curricula of private schools and others elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacant positions, 17 per cent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, the ability to speak many languages is again vital to prepare young men for the challenges of life.
Along with the increased employment opportunities available to those who need languages, these skills are vital in a world of uncertainty.
Regardless of what career a person chooses for life, if they learn a second language, they will realize a wise long-term future benefit like this:
The opportunity to communicate directly with people from foreign countries would instantly put a multilingual person on top of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to communicate and French was the only spoken language and only a two-digit fraction of the population, 15 per cent.
That is why investing in language education now is beneficial for children of the future.
Having more languages, especially in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
Most schools will focus on more modern languages, but the rest will teach languages considered most useful for England in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your children's interests may be, there will always be a selection of languages from private schools, with local teachers who are experts.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the intellectual strength needed to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It cannot be denied that at this moment, in a global business environment, languages continue to play a useful role for the future of the country, so it is necessary to include this in knowledge.
Of course, modern languages should be taken literally as international communication technologies.
Private schools will continue to provide this option, co-habitable and outstanding for young people in Scotland.
It must be done well.

LeBron will make the Lakers appear Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's opening game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he just doesn't know how long he'll be able to play.
"It would be more than one and close to 48" Walton said on the Lakers' website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably only be making minute statements.
After the trial earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need my early games at this stage of my career to be ready", he said.
The Trump Summit of West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump began a series of meetings this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five Trump meetings over the next week that included stand-ups in friendly neighborhoods bordering Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the suspension of the confirmation vote he had chosen to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections since Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress by the time of the November vote.
When is the Trump evening conference in West Virginia and how can I watch it online?
The Trump event is scheduled for Wheeling, West Virginia at 7pm today Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump West Virginia rally online below when it is on YouTube.
Trump has no surprise speaking out on the issue this week for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, which has been stalled over the sexual assault scandal with the expectation of a Senate vote-barring for another week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of the rally was to help the Republicans who face the November elections to get some energy.
So, the Trump campaign has said the purpose of these five meetings over the coming week is to "celebrate volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will be visiting many states as we enter the off-season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters but declined to be named.
The show, which is set for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight will bring fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the media to Pittsburgh", according to Metro News of West Virginia.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump will visit West Virginia, a state that won more than 40 percent of the votes cast in 2016.
Trump is trying to help out Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is behind in the election.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey until the president comes to try to add another margin to the election", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showcases its battle for the coveted Sunday singles title
After one-sided periods, Saturday's four-game series will probably be just what this Ryder Cup needs.
The change in the behavior of a young boxer is a matter of play in general but one in which the athletes really believe, and it has never been so except in competitions like these.
So where would they say the hook is now?
"They used to have a lead of six points and now it's four, so we consider that a bit of a bump in my mind", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, literally, four points ahead with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel a little helpful in the matter although they have a lot to encourage them, at least not the Spieth and Justin Thomas type who played together all day and each got up three out of four points.
Spieth was a poison from tee to green and led by example.
These festive cries echoed as the circle continued, sinking a four-square-foot object of significance as he and Thomas were killed two after the other.
His attempt to beat them on the 15th was met with such a roar, which suggests he believed the American team was not just out of the woods.
"You have to literally get in deep and worry about your game", says Spieth.
All of these players are gone now.
18 holes to score another point.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in over two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a less-than-successful Ryder Club record.
A couple of a certain European breed but popular are four out of four and would never do anything wrong.
The two became the only two who did not shoot a gun on Saturday afternoon but also avoided the shots on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and after 9am on Friday morning.
That was over, and their energy was completely gone from the attendance and the public forums that asserted that they were the players to beat on Sunday, and that there would be no more player to cover any possible European victory as the sun rose over Le Golf National instead of Fleetwood or Molinari.
If the object is completely at the same time in different holes.
The glory of Europe is still to be seen.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly played Sergio Garcia, the morning quadruple champion, when they were paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey with two curves on the front nine Spanish and Swedish diggers in a tunnel that they never came close to getting out.
On Sunday, though, no one will help you out of your hole.
The four balls and the four connections are interesting at least from close up because of the interaction between the two connections, the decisions they make, the decisions they don't make and the way one strategy can change the other.
Europe have played well as a team so far and have become leaders on the final day but this quarter-final season also shows that Team USA is in for a fight of that, especially Stateside, they have been through the motions.
Europe leads 10 and 6 in the Ryder Cup finals
Europe will have another advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after rising from Saturday's four-ball and four-game series with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The two-time defending champions Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the change by winning two victories over Tiger Woods who was struggling to lift the number so far at Le Golf National to four.
European side Thomas Bjorn, the cup-holder, had lost at Hazeltine two years earlier, dominating a disappointing US side in the morning four balls, taking a 3-1 lead.
The United States added a push in the quarterfinals, winning two games, but they were unable to score in the repechage.
Jim Furyk's department needed points from 12 Sunday singles matches to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to score four goals while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a weekend of talk and the only two combined to score four points from their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball and then up beating Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by another spectacular 5 and 4.
Woods, who retired from playing in two games on Saturday, showed a professional appearance but has now lost 19 of his four games and four of seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning's four goals, returned to teammate Henrik Stenson in a four-game sweep to a 2-1 score by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the world's number one and number three.
Europe has not found it so easy, the windy south-west Paris day.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new record for the Americans with two titles on Saturday.
They scored another disappointing 2 and 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm Ian Poulter in four overs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in four games after losing the opening two holes.
It was only once in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team had come back from a four-point loss in singles, although as the holders of the Furyk division needed only a standing horse to hold the trophy.
After two days of second best, however, another attack on Sunday seemed to be too much for them.
North Korea says it can't disarm alone without peace
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions further push its disdain for the United States and that there is no way the country will leave its nuclear weapons alone under any circumstances.
Ri Yong told the UN's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant steps" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying a nuclear test site, and pledging not to expand nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any response from the US", he said.
Without any confidence of the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we alone can reduce our weapons first.
While Rike has repeated South Korean complaints about Washington's refusal to pursue a "slow" nuclear arms reduction strategy under which North Korea would be awarded a "free" nuclear weapon while taking other steps, his speech is significant because it does not reject nuclear weapons reduction alone and not just as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint speech by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit between the sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmament in the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea is looking for a way to end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must abandon its nuclear weapons from the start.
Washington has also rejected my calls for relaxing international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States has been committed to nuclear weapons from the beginning and has increased the level of sanctions pressure to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, as well as rejecting the end-of-war declaration", Ri said.
The idea that a curfew can bring us to our knees is a fantasy of people who have a grudge against us.
But the problem is that continued restrictions are increasing our dissatisfaction.
Ri did not comment on the preparations for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US president had commented on at the UN earlier in the week.
Instead the minister referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: If the country involved in this nuclear exit issue would be South Korea and not the United States leaving the Korean nuclear arsenal would not have had such a problem.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was slightly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the US territory and the Korean missiles were something he had to sing about after the "Mr. President Disaster Management" Trup called Kim a "suicide rocket man".
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened a complete annihilation of North Korea, praised Kim for his determination to take steps to reduce arms, but said there was still work to be done and sanctions remained in place until North Korea abandoned nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no set time for this, saying Whether it will take two years, three years or five years - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: The Security Council's sanctions must be enforced continuously without fail until we see a complete nuclear disarmament finally determined.
The Security Council has generally imposed more stringent sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly where he said he would then visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times so far this year, but his visits have been less than pleasant.
He left Pyongyang in July claiming that progress had been made, only to be overruled by North Korea's refusal to pursue "guerrilla-like demands".
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to demolish a missile test site and a nuclear facility if the US takes "some steps" in the direction.
He said Kim told him "some of the side measures" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University this year offered all its students extra sleep in an attempt to break the tradition of studying all night by drinking coffee.
One teacher found that students at one of the world's leading universities were generally ignorant of basic principles regarding how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of anesthesiology at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the designer of the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
 Finally one girl came to me and said: Why did we not learn this until now, in my final year?
She said that no one had ever told her about the benefits of sleep - something that surprised her, she told The Telegraph.
The first session of the course this year, where students were told the benefits of good sleep habits in academic and athletic performance, as well as in their overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health services at the university, said the university made the decision to introduce the course after discovering that students were severely deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour-long session included a series of discussions.
In one section was a chapter of a dormitory, where students pressed coffee cups, sheets, trainers and books to be told the effects of coffee and light and how the practice of jogging affects sleep deprivation, and the use of ritual bedtime routines.
In one unit, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and stroke.
A school map, with interactivity symbols, then encourages the attendees to reflect on their daily activities.
We know it won't change student behavior overnight.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke", Professor Czeisler added.
The tradition of staying up all night is still alive, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students means sleep deprivation is becoming a major problem.
The guarantee of getting enough sleep, a good one, should be for the student a secret weapon to suppress depression, fatigue and tension, he says - or to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of malnutrition, keeping them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physiology student, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of the previous year's failures during his first year at Harvard.
He says that the course opened his eyes and attracted him to push the course throughout the school.
Hoping for the next step, he will ask all students in the postgraduate department to complete a similar curriculum before entering a competitive school.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students should be careful about setting a time alarm for when to go to bed, and even when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted from the screens of electronic devices and LED lights, which can throw your waking system into a state of unconsciousness, leading to insomnia.
Livingston 1 and Rangers 0: The defeat of Menga humiliated Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered a setback when Dolly Menga's attack cut Steven Gerrard's side which had split to a 1 and 0 draw at Livingston.
Ibrox side were looking to produce their first win on the road since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side drew just Gerrard's second win in 18 games as manager leaving his side with eight points in the knockout stages at Ladbrokes Road to the Hearts Premiership title.
Menga's attack came seven minutes before half time and another short-line hit by the Rangers on a draw never looked like a flat finish.
While the Rangers now dropped down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third and just behind Hibernian on the score difference.
And there could be more violence in store for the Rangers until linebacker Calum Spence was treated for a serious injury after apparently throwing something from the end of the pitch.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side which threw Ayr into the play-offs before the final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, had gone with the Livi 11 that had pulled the plug on Hearts a week earlier and would have been delighted by how his coaches had harassed their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers would have been dominating to catch the ball but Livingston did a lot with the ball they got.
They should have scored only in the first two minutes of the first Menga substitution which sent Scott Pittman through in a win over Allan McGregor but the central defender extended his chances considerably.
A goalless penalty from Keaghan Jacobs was scored by Craig Halkett but his teammate Alan Lithgow was only able to extend the position.
The Rangers have just taken control but there is a sign of more optimism than agreement about their games in the last three.
Alfredo Morelos undoubtedly felt he should have been asked to score a goal in the third half as he and Steven Lawless clashed but referee Steven Thomson forgot the Colombian challenge.
Rangers attempted only a couple of first-half hits on the attack but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly showed no signs of slowing down from Lassana Coulibaly's head-kick and another quick attack by Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's 34-minute goal may be on the line, no one can deny that they deserve it for their recent victory.
The Rangers again failed to solve another Jacobs-injured injury.
Scott Arfield did not respond where Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who was cold to consider Menga for the shortest finish.
Gerrard worked on the break where he replaced Coulibaly and Ryan Kent and the switch almost produced an immediate impact as the corner-attacker of the message to Morelos but the interesting Kelly ran off his line to block.
But Livingston kept on driving the visitors to the real game they were enjoying, with Lithgow and Halkett getting the long ball up in the air behind the long ball.
The Holt side would have extended their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood firmly to stop Jacobs before Lithgow knocked you off the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton got another penalty shoot-out in which he tried to tie Jacobs but Thomson was sidelined.
The Almanac: The Origin of the Geiger Counter
And now another page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, also called THE DAY OF THE DAY ... the day the future geologist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring the motion of steam, a process that led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
A scientific reference since then, the Geiger Counter has become a reference in the popular culture of its time, with the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the unseen scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's the Geiger Counter, used to detect minerals, such as chemical uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can actually hear the chemical reactions of the atomic vapor produced in the resource.
Evans: "You said it was coming out now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days short of his 63rd birthday.
But his invention that bears his name still lives.
New cancer vaccine can train the immune system to detect problem cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to detect and kill problem cells
Vaccines train the immune system to identify problem cells as part of the treatment
The procedures involve extracting immune cells from a patient, and then testing them in a laboratory
They can then find a nutrient that most cancers know and re-enter
One experimental injection has shown positive results in patients in a different stage of the disease.
One woman who received injection, which trains the immune system to detect faulty cells, saw her cervical cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting immune cells from a patient, where they are modified in the laboratory to detect a protein known to many cancers called HER2, and then re-inserting them into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that there is a vaccine that will work".
Professor Berzofsky says that HERS "can affect the size of many types of cancer", including breast, uterine, lung, and colon.
A technique similar to this has been used to take cells from the body of a patient and "train" them to attack cancer cells and has worked in treating the onset of cancer.
Kanye West Begins to Scold Trump's Haters, Dressed in a MAGA Shirt, After His SNL Appearance.
A Mismatch
There was a shout out to Kanye West in the broadcast booth during Saturday Night Live after a loud one-liner in which he praised the President of the United States. Donald Trump also said he would seek a stand-off in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town where he wears a Make America Great hat, he passed by making a loud noise at Democrats and stressing his support for Trump.
"I've spoken to a white man several times and they've said: "How can you like Trump, he's a bigot?"
Well, if I had been concerned about gender differences I would have left the United States long ago", he said.
SNL premiered the program with a comedy episode starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star gives a humorous account of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the short audio clip of West was uploaded by Chris Rock on social media.
It is not known whether Rock attempted to demonize West with his output.
Similarly, West complained to the audience that he suffered behind the scenes over what was on his own.
"I was abused in the background.
'You can't go out there wearing the hat,' they said.
They were cruel!
And they say I'm a green guy", he said as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
West continues: Would you like to see the green space? he says "I'm going to wear a big man's hat, because it means you can't tell us what to do.
Try the love".
His comments drew at least two rounds of public outcry and members of the SNL cast expressed embarrassment, according to Variety, with one person there telling the publication: "The studio is completely silent".
West was brought in as the eventual replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a song entitled Ilove it, in which he dressed as a Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TRUSA, Candace Turner who on Twitter said: To one of the brave: THANK YOU FOR RISING UP YOUR WITHERS.
But the host of the show Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West "just shows what he is and that's really cool".
"But I choose not to give a gift to anyone (by buying their music or merchandise or showing support for their "wisdom") who I believe is spreading and promoting a belief that is harmful to my community.
He was free.
She added: "We are".
Prior to the episode, the rapper announced via Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now "somebody I used to know as Kanye West".
He was not the first singer to change his name and follow the band Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His brother rapper Snoop Dogg was formerly known as Snoop Lion and then the famous singer Prince, changing his name to a trademark and the singer was formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder by stabbing in a Belfast grocery store
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a grocery store in east Belfast on Friday.
It happened at Ballyhackamore, a police station.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The State Prosecution Office will update the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has criticized the idea of puberty
Kit Harington is known for portraying the sword-turning role of Jon Snow in the HBO series the medieval thriller Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old director criticized the male heroism, saying that such portrayals meant that young children often felt that they had to be different before they could be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to address the problem of male stereotypes in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, confirmed that he feels 'very strongly' about dealing with the issue.
I feel in my body, very strong, at this moment - where did we go wrong with the idea of a giant man?' he said.
What are we teaching the men as they grow up, given the problems we see today?'
Kit believes television may be entitled to the promotion of this male superhero concept because of the male superheroes being cast.
He continues: What is the body and what is the teaching?
The kind of TV, street, and street culture that makes little children feel that they must be next to someone?
I feel that this is one of the great questions of our time - how do we change this?
Because something is clearly wrong with the boys.'
In an interview he also confirmed that he would no longer be filming Game of Thrones when the series ended in the next winter, saying he had 'finished battlefields and horses'.
From November Kit will appear in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West which is a fictionalized account of a film producer and his brother, who is an armed robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers the reunion of his wife Rose to be the best thing that ever came out of Game of Thrones.
I met my wife on this show, so in this way he gave me my future family, and life would start from here,' he said.
Rose appeared in Ygritte, Kit's romantic interest in Jon Snow, in this Emmy award-winning film.
The couple got married in June 2018 in the courtyard of their Leslie family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 percent increase in new cases
China reported a 14 percent increase in its population living with asthma and immunodeficiency.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials say.
Nearly 40,000 new infections were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new infections are sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China due to contaminated blood transfusions.
But the number of HIV infections by this method has dropped to almost zero, health officials said in a county in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and immunodeficiency virus disease in China increases by over 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a major issue in China's gay and lesbian community.
The ban on homosexuality in China was lifted in 1997, but discrimination against homosexuals is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's tradition of patriarchy, studies have estimated that 70 to 90 percent of men who have had homosexual relations will eventually marry.
Most infections come from inadequate sexual protection during these interactions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to make HIV treatment available internationally as part of an effort to contain the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking information that her employer leaked the GOP senators' files, angrily calling them 'bad complaints' and 'hypocritical matters'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied rumors that a member of her staff had leaked the impeachment information of three Republican U.S. senators on the senators' pages in Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that the rumors were spread by "fiancé theorists" and by spy networks.
"Some of the most damaging complaints, some of the most damaging, some of the most damaging", Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
The leaked information is said to include home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all of Utah.
The information was leaked online on Thursday, by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Yoyon came some time after three senators asked a question in Kavanaugh.
Web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the output foot was associated with the "Water's office" that released the information of a member of the Waters staff, Hill reported.
This baseless myth is a complete lie and another complete lie, Waters continues.
The leaks were not caused by my employees - whose testimony, appointment, and protection were dissolved as a result of these scams and false rumors.
This baseless myth is a lie and a complete fabrication".
Waters' speech drew criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This rejection was irritating, in Fleischer's writing.
This indicates that she was not qualified to be a Member of Parliament.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they do not necessarily get upset.
They would not have to be determined.
They would not have to question the motives of the accused.
They need to calm down and concentrate".
Fleischer was appearing for the comparison to Waters's response to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized for appearing too dismissive during Thursday's debate.
Omar Navarro, a candidate seeking to seize Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Abah if it is true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted her "to the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these allegations of bribery.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified, she continues, "and will be held accountable for all their acts that are degrading and harmful to anyone and all members of my staff".
Johnny English Reviews - Rowan Atkinson the most powerful spy
It is now a tradition to see the benefits of Brexit in any film with a British actor and that doesn't mean it will go down to this revival of the Johnny English comedy - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back live in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is it self-deprecating to say that we are the new country with import rights?
In any case, the eye came out for the plastic face of Johnny English who couldn't afford to get his license to design new material for a second time - this name of his suggested more than anything that he was an invention of a wide-ranging game designed for movie-goers in non-English speaking areas.
He was actually a stupid spy despite the fact that his style depicted a certain kind of comfort dress worn by Clouseau's son, a Mr. Bean employee and a fellow employee of the same man who contributed as single-note to the soundtrack of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
And he was also the original top traveler and the international figure Atkinson once played in a now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, leaving a ripple effect on his wake.
There are one or two good features in this latest JE edition.
I liked the way Johnny English approached a helicopter as he dressed in his old-fashioned armor and had a rotor blade attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is often shown in public, but the comedy seems to be much weaker and more subdued, especially when considering that popular "no-game" films such as the 007 series and Mission Impossible themselves are now more daring to produce comedy as their own subgenre.
The joke seemed to be more about children than adults, and to me the horror that Johnny English saw was not so much fantasy and they were experiencing the Atkinson plot in the character of Bean.
The main point of the discussion was that Great Britain was in a state of great turmoil.
A hacker hacked into the British intelligence agency's online network, exposing the testimony of all British agents in the department, to the disgrace of the acting agent - a minor problem that is often felt as a criticism of Kevin Eldon's small role.
It was the ultimate dilemma for a self-righteous and ambitious prime minister, already suffering from the melting pot of political disenchantment: Emma Thompson did her best with this un-Teresa May attitude but not much in the way of a career.
Her secret counselors told her that almost every spy was corrupted, she had to bring in someone from retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, now working as a schoolteacher in a good institution, but leaving the lessons in how to become a spy: some good gags here, as English provides a spy reading of some sort.
English was pulled back to Whitehall for an urgent explanation and reconnected with his former assistant on the side Bough, made over Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, involved with a ship's captain, a kind of unpleasant role where Vicki Pepperdine becomes a bit of a time-waster.
So Batman and Robin make a terrible mistake on the Queen's Secret Service and return to work, meeting the troubled beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylenko.
Right now, the prime minister is failing dangerously under the influence of a coveted tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer disaster: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began to examine their plan: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant light; they created a commotion where they sucked themselves through the comfort of the Volta; and English chanted an outrage at his attempts to use a Virtual Reality headset to make sense of himself and the Volta home.
Of course all the stands were pulled for the final series, but despite its beauty and size, there was a children's television about the whole thing.
The average is good.
And with all the other Johnny English films I couldn't stop thinking: why wouldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role to play that would actually do justice to his genius?
Labour refuses to accept a proposal for a four-day working week for British workers and five days pay
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will be considering a major scheme that would see Britons working four days a week - but getting paid for five days.
According to reports the party wants the CEOs to hand over the money saved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the employees by giving them an extra day off.
He would see workers enjoying a three-day weekend - but still receiving the same pay.
The sources said the strategy would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country into what workers want.
The move to a four-day week has gained the approval of the National Union of Labour as a way for workers to reap the benefits of economic change.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "A review of the resolution is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight but another four-day work week is a tempting and appropriate part of the party's approach to economic restructuring for the worker and even the overall party strategy towards the factory.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to adopt such a view, with the Green Party promising a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
The Labour Party is currently not showing any general support for the attraction, however.
A Labour spokesman said: 'A four-day work week is not a party resolution and has been considered by the party.'
The junior chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to express his vision for a revolution of socialist ideology in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was ready to seize power from 'hidden directors' and 'profit-makers' in public utility companies.
The mini-canal schemes also mean that current investors in water companies will likely not get a full return on their investment because a Labour government could 'slow down' on what is seen as unfair grounds.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on the company board and create Private Equity Funds to give 10 percent of the equity of the business sector companies to employees, who can earn annual profits of up to 500 euros.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's false investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on the nominee for Supreme Court by at least a week, and raised questions as to whether the agency's findings would draw every Republican senator in their favor.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy described him as more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
I mean, of course, the Kennedy machine.
"I said I would go into the hearing room", I said, "and talk to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that the spell appeared, and I said, 'Did you do that?'
It is firmly set, ready, and not shaken".
Graham's choice, however, seemed to be a planned one.
"My heart is ready for Brett Kavanaugh and he will take on a big charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it so strongly", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she named could not be identified.
It was 36 years.
I don't see anything new".
What Is Nationalism, and Has It Ended Poverty?
This Saturday New York will mark the seventh World Patriot Festival, an annual music festival with a big impact that will attract stars who will do another exciting mission; to end poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy athletes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the festival's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Day, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Action Against Poverty, an international group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the service (unless you are willing to pay for a ticket for the main event), concertgoers must complete a series of voluntary "acts", send an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call or do anything to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how did the Civil War succeed 12 years before it reached its goal?
Is the philosophy of rewarding people through a free choir forum a good way to entice people to request a call to action, or just another form of "clicktivism" - people feeling like they're really making a difference by signing up for an online petition or posting a Twitter message?
Since 2011, Citizens of the World says it has collected more than 19 million "projects" from its supporters, sending them various goals.
It says that these initiatives have helped to persuade world leaders to announce pledges and commitments worth some $37 billion that are projected to affect the livelihoods of more than 2.25 billion people on earth by 2030.
In early 2018, the group brought forward 390 pledges and announcements that came from its operations, with at least $10 billion already invested or raised.
The group estimates that the money raised directly affected some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most notable donations include the Healthy Food Initiative, a UK-based coalition of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow into their full potential", and a pledge to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from Citizens of the World.
With support from UK government donors, philanthropists, national governments, and Global Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a historic event, Nutrition Challenge Ambassador Tracey Ullman said at a public event during the Live Poetry Festival in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking over 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for another initiative, the Healthy Food Initiative, which will provide 5 million women and children with nutrition subsidies.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on her website she asks "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The world's citizens respond: It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil liberties and the struggle against the apartheid regimes that preceded us, we will win, because we are strong enough together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers who will perform at this year's festival in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US will use navy to "block" to prevent the export of lost goods - Home Secretary
Washington could "if necessary" use its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East, according to US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke pretended that Russia's intervention in Syria - which he said was at the invitation of a government known to have done so - was a ruse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to get energy just like they did in Eastern Europe, southern central Europe", the report said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and strategies to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure open ocean lanes, and, if necessary, to fund it, to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at a conference organized by the Energy Consumers Association, a non-profit group that serves as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared the approaches taken by Washington in relations with Russia and Iran, since they were similar.
"The economic downside to Iran and Russia is, to a greater or lesser extent, the benefits of oil substitution", he said, while referring to Russia as a "coin-a-thon" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The comments came as the Trump administration has since begun working on a policy to boost the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the cheapest choice for consumers in Europe.
As a result, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to pull the "wrong" Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which according to Trump, makes Berlin and Moscow "prisoners".
Moscow further emphasized that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the current pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a genuine economic project.
The Kremlin claimed that Washington's strong opposition to the project was triggered by economic reasons and became an example of a misguided game.
"I think we have the view that energy will not be a one-size-fits-all pressure equipment if consumers choose the suppliers", Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US move drew a reaction from Germany, which confirmed the launch of the project.
The German industrial giant, the German Industrial Union (BDI) has called on the US to suspend the EU's energy policy and the cooperation agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious problem with the third state interfering in our electricity supply", said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Association (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will make "a good study" of her Presidential candidacy in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would make a "very thorough study" of her presidential candidacy after holding the midterm elections.
During a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would run.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government and that includes women upstairs", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will consider carefully running for president.
Warren filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump in the city council, saying he was running the country in an unfair manner.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has long been critical of Trump and his Supreme Court Associate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We definitely need an FBI investigation before the election".
A poll result released on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren County residents do not think she will run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the congresswoman would not run, according to the Suffolk County Political Research Institute/Boston General Election poll.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The election results showed the most support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidate, with 38 percent voting in favour of the potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Some top Democrats discussed the possibility of running in 2020 including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Congressman Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Launched the PTSD Track Palin at the event of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he is recovering from, I can relate to other families who are feeling traumatized about PTSD and some of the wounds that the military is recovering", she told the crowd at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the confinement of her son and other soldiers "a prison sentence" and said that they were returning in a different condition, they were returning with a sense of regret, they were returning in memory if there was this respect that their fellow soldiers, national and air, and any other security forces had given to his country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering in a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennet, the Wasilla Police Department's Deputy Sheriff.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of a new asylum system
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to the new U.S. system that prohibits asylum for gang violence and domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a counter-claim on Friday, in Washington in support of the asylum seeker's challenge to the system, NBC reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Unresolved case brought in August by the American Civil War Association against the structure of the federal government.
She said her partner and her controversial gang-banged children had abused her but US officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys in favor of Grace compared El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce many asylum seekers in the United States, as states facing multiple problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum system reverses a 2014 decision by the Immigration and Naturalization Service that allowed undocumented domestic violence refugees to apply for asylum.
Attorney General for the District of Columbia Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "does not take into account decades of previously existing civil, federal, and international law".
"Federal law requires that any claim for asylum to be decided on the merits of the case and, therefore, such a rope violates this principle", the co-counsel said.
Officials continue to emphasize the obvious that immigration policies are hurting the U.S. economy, saying they can become entrepreneurs and "create decent jobs".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration authorities not to grant asylum to victims of severe domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who have fled their country because of persecution or fear because of their ethnicity, religion, origin, or representation in any other group or political opinion", Sessions said in the June 11 policy announcement.
Refugees will not solve all the problems - or even all the serious ones - that people face every day around the world.
Urgent rescue efforts at Palu as deaths intensify in the race for survivors
For the living, the situation worsened.
"It was violent", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her baby in a shelter in Palu.
Every minute, the ambulance is bringing in the bodies.
Here is the clean water.
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, picking up the items from the water, trying to assess whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which overwhelmed the city.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered injuries to his back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palus Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the intensity of the incident.
Tears filled his eyes as he recalled how the quake shook the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
We have no time to escape capture.
I was squeezed into the collapsed wall, thinking, "Harris told the Big News, he added that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then I was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I think they're fine.
US ambassador accuses China of 'abusing' with 'advertising propaganda'
A week after a Chinese newspaper used four pages a day to advertise criticism of US-China trade relations, however, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press and spreading propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said China was paying a daily subscription to the Des Moines daily - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after China was accused of seeking to interfere in the November 6 presidential election, a charge China denies.
Trump's allegation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election indicates that US officials told Reuters it was a new Washington-US pressure plan against China.
It is common for foreign governments to introduce advertising to promote trade, while Beijing and Washington are locked in a war-trade war that has led them to levels of revenue graphs per capita.
China's initial response to the tariff in the trade war was the launch of industries that would break states such as Iowa that Trump's Republican Party supporters, the Chinese and the US said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece Sunday in Ragista Des Moines, "is now taking a crackdown on this abuse by using propaganda ads in free newspapers".
"In propaganda, the Chinese government is contributing to the creation of an American culture of free speech and freedom of the press by paying for advertising in the Des Moines neighborhood", Branstad said.
He added, "In the Beijing library, you will find no noise that can prevent you from understanding the different perspectives that the Chinese society is facing in terms of economic stress, because the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party", he said.
He added that "one of China's most influential newspapers turned down an offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans are dividing on women voters ahead of the Kavanaugh debacle, observers warn
Many senior Republicans have stood firm and defended Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as he faces allegations of sexual assault, and observers have warned that they will see obstacles, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The mood around this was great, and most Republicans were in the process of indicating that they wanted to continue the election.
These things are irreversible", Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill of an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake of (R-Arizona) in the final stages of the FBI investigation could spark voter anger.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokeswoman for the PressGaba women's group, said on Friday, according to The Washington DC Post.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate chamber as the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee voted to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic was the one who brought the allegation.
"Democratic fervor and motivation will be in the message", Stu Rothenberg, a political reporter, told the news site.
"People say that he has already been in heaven, and that is true.
But it may be higher, especially among women's suffrage groups, in rural areas and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who do not want a president, will not vote".
Even before Ford's testimony appeared publicly about her allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, commentators have pointed to the potential support that could follow if the Republican Party continues to assert.
"This has been a major setback for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican Federal Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's election or the last election or whether Kavanaugh was put on the bench, and about how Republicans handled that and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, director of American Priorities, a support group for Democratic candidates, was quoted as saying by the media.
However, Americans are divided over who to believe after the appearance of the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, with few remaining strong opinions.
A recent YouGov poll showed 41 percent of respondents doubted or certainly believed Ford's candidacy, while 35 percent were sure or certainly believed Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same for Ford.
After Flake's departure, the FBI is investigating the case brought by Ford and one other suspect, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh was intoxicated when he molested her when she was 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee had sexually assaulted her while attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the world wide web is planning to launch a new website on the interfaces of google and facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is planning to launch a project that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is a company that builds the open source platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Mining allows users to choose where to store information and what access to information is granted to individuals.
In an exclusive interview with Fast, Berners-Lee joked that the reason for creating Inrupt was "global domination".
"We don't have to do it now", he said of the beginning.
"This is a historic time".
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online data warehouses" or PODs.
It contains a contact list, to-do list, calendar, music library and various solo instruments and instrumentalists.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on the same browser all at the same time.
The amazing thing about the self-storage option in an online store is that the user has complete control over the type of information.
The company calls it "powered by data collected".
Inrupt's vision, according to CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring the resources, process and convenience to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security system acquired by IBM, several staff developers worked on the project, and his team of coders.
Starting this week, tech manufacturers around the world will be able to create their own distributed drives using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee explained that he and his colleagues did not discuss with "Facebook and Google whether or not they would introduce a change where their entire business model would pass overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission".
In a press release published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's purpose is to provide energy for business and the case for helping to protect the integrity and efficiency of the new Solid Web site".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet once again when he founded the World Wide Web Forum at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Within a few months, Berners-Lee was a leading voice in the inequality debate.
Even at the time of Inrupt's launch, Berners-Lee would be the co-founder and co-director of the Open Web Foundation and the Open Data Center.
I have good hope for this modern revolution of the web, berners -lee added.
Bernard Vann: The WW1 Victoria Cross is awarded
The largest Anglican congregation ever to win the prestigious Victoria Cross during World War One and the most dedicated to the cause celebrated in their hometown for over 100 years.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and he did not know that he had won the British army's highest award.
A memorial stone to him unveiled by his two grandchildren at a hedge in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, described it as "a unique symbol" that would be described as 100 years old as the gift his grandfather had received.
According to the London Chronicle, on 29 September 1918, Lt Col Vann led his troops across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very disturbing and foggy passage too dark for fire from the battlefield and machine guns".
He then climbed up to the firing line with "the greatest warrior" who led the front of the line before he fired his gun alone and brought three armies to their knees.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German bombers on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, says that his grandfather's work "is something I know I could never be but something humble".
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, also put up a banner after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "I was very impressed with the young man for his part in the parade" and added that he was a great hero who was shown support and help from the people".
MMA fans were sitting around watching Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this, you sit down to watch Bellator 206 only to be prevented from watching the actual event.
The broadcast from San Jose featured 13 fights, including six on the main card and was broadcast live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were left in shock when the scene changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not concerned after sitting until early in the morning especially for the fight.
One fan explained on Twitter that the switch to children's cartoons is like a "kind of sick toy".
"It's a government policy that at 6 a.m. to change the channel because the program is not appropriate so they have to switch to children's programming", Dave Schwartz, vice president of communications and marketing, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Aleden, you know what I mean?"
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said they would be working on plans to engage with British viewers in the future.
"I think if I thought about reprinting, I think it might be worth it", Coker said.
"But it is six o'clock on Sunday morning there, and we cannot do so until our Sunday time, Monday's time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was replaced there were messages floating around and all of them were unpleasant.
We tried to fix it, assuming it was a technical problem.
But it is not, it is a matter of government.
I assure you that this will never happen again.
Believe me, when it was replaced there were messages floating around and all of them were unpleasant.
It is a frustrating attitude.
Discs Island Desert: Tom Daley feels 'up' because of gender
Olympic athlete Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling superior because of his race - but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old admits that he did not realize until he entered high school that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first broadcast of Radio 4 Desert Island hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give others "protection".
And he said that being a father made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The presenter of the daily program, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
While appearing as a different character on the first episode of Laverne, Daley said he felt "below" anyone's adulthood because "it's not acceptable to give the public the love of boys and girls".
He says: "To this day, my feelings of inferiority, and my feelings of something different, have been the main sources of strength and strength for me to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so he did not disappoint anyone when they discovered his species.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a major LGBT activist and used it at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to seek more countries to allow gay rights.
He said that he spoke because he enjoyed being out in the open without interruption and wanted to give others "a measure of security".
The three-time world champion said falling in love with American male boxer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was a surprise".
Daley married Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year but said the age gap is not a concern.
"When you've been through a lot at a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he says it's hard to find a man who has ever achieved such a feat.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all the excitement of living with him" had changed.
"If you ask me last year, the whole point is 'I need to win the gold medal,'" he said.
 You know, there are things that are more important than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not believe he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had their tickets to London 2012 - since he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't say that you wouldn't get a chance to sit in the front row without Dad", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and until he stopped breathing and died before I could accept that he was a human being", he said.
The year before Daley had competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just know that this is what I have dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of the local crowd at the Olympics, there is no better situation", he said.
And it inspired his first song selection - Pride from Heather Small - which he performed in preparation for the Olympics and performed with a bow and arrow.

Poor Mickelson was kept out of the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American athlete Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays in the 47th Ryder Cup, but he has to change his format to avoid disappointment in the standings.
Mickelson, playing in the 12th inning, was saved by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-on-four.
Instead of being in the middle of the game, as is common for the United States, the five-time defending champion splits his day between being a motivational speaker and working on his online game with the hope of fixing what he has.
Not stable in drives or during his playing career, the 48-year-old was unfit for the tough level of the Le Golf of the Federation circuit, where he was prone to punishments and violent violence.
And if the game itself didn't work out, Mickelson, in game nine on Sunday, faced British heavyweight champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games that week.
If the Americans, four points down on their opening 12-game lead, jump up to the plate, Mickelson's play would be a crucial one.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, although he could say nothing more.
"He realized the importance of his day, he leaned back and put his arm around me, saying he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He was very confident.
He was one of the most famous heroes and was the most promoted in the movement before, and this week.
I never thought it would be possible for him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's the system and that's the way we thought we were going to go.
He wanted to be out there, like everyone else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
He could end a Ryder Cup match that would never be matched by the highest level in history alone.
Mickelson won 18, lost 20 and drew seven games, although Furyk said his presence brought some important things to the team.
"He was funny, silly, funny, liked to make fun of people, and became a great player in the theater", he said.
"I think the young athletes like to make fun of him, even this week, which is interesting.
It brings more than just the present.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knew that the great gap would soon pass
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knew from his experience that getting a few breaks in the last few days in the individual Ryder Cup slide was also difficult driving.
Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, with Seve Ballesteros leading by five points over the Americans but only managing to finish the line with their noses in front at the most read distance, winning 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"Keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama, we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only", said Bjorn, who explained, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to finish 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Toh Tarihi will show me and everyone in this organization that it is not finished yet.
You have a full day tomorrow.
go there and do everything right.
This is not done until you find the keys on the screen.
We have a goal, and that is to try to bring that cup, and that is where we will be zealous.
I said at the beginning, I'm focused on the 12 players on our team, but we all know what's going on on the other side - they have world champions.
Knowing how these players performed on the difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get to heaven alone in this.
Tomorrow is a big one.
Tomorrow is to make the next equation, and it's also something different to do.
It's great to be with a partner when things are good, but when you go out on your own, then you're being tested to your full potential as a golfer.
That's the message you need to get to the athletes, is to bring out your potential tomorrow.
Now, leave your friends behind because he must bring out his own talent, and so on".
Unlike Bjorn, number opponent Jim Furyk would ask his teammates to perform more skillfully than they did in the partnership, which included Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on the verge of these big teams lately, having been one of the few players to win the tournament at Brookline before they went on to lose as Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medina".
"I remember every bad word", he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, put his teammates together for the final day.
"We have 12 games tomorrow, but then you start to come up as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When stress enters one direction, it puts an extreme strain on these midfield players.
We set our steps according to the best and put their people in the style we want, you know, we try to surprise tomorrow".
Thomas was given the opportunity to try to lead Rory McIlroy in the top game along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the top half in the same order.
"I went with this group of people in this arrangement because it seemed to cover the whole road", Bjorn recalls of his poetry.
New German battleship delayed again
The new German Navy ship is due to be launched in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era battleships. but it will not be available until at least next year due to design flaws and snow cost, media reports reported.
The launch of Rheinland-Pfalz, which leads the newly created state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to a report by Die Zeit.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but delivery problems halted the completion of the project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will come as replacements for the older Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will include a powerful fire station, aerial and naval weapons and other advanced technologies, such as radar, infrared and sound interception.
Other important features include the long development time - new frigates should be used for up to two years from local water ports.
However, the delay indicates the effectiveness of the battleship - which would allow Germany to display superior naval power - they would be out of commission by the time they entered service, reports Die Zeit.
The Aibun F125 Frigate made headlines last year, when German naval officials refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss depot in Hamburg.
The intention was to re-sign the Navy to return the ship to its builder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media reported "programming errors" that made the warship appear useless if deployed on combat duty.
The Manhaj class was of vital importance as they were operated by a crew of 120 Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates.
He also explained that the ship had a heavy weight which reduced its performance and limited the ability of the navy to improve later.
It is estimated that the 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" "was as heavy as the ships of the same type used by Germany in World War II.
Besides poor equipment, the cost of the entire project - including training the workers - becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - up from the original €2.2 billion.
The problems plaguing the new frigates became significant in the wake of recent warnings that the German navy's power was dwindling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the commander of the German National Security Council, admitted that the real submarine "first emerged during the launch of the right-wing aircraft".
The official said the problem was the snowfall at the right time, as the old ships were stopped but replacements were not provided.
He was saddened that none of the people of Baden-Württemberg had boarded the ship.
The secret life of the giant
A new study in a Scottish Highlands area aims to explain how the great apes exploit space in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results of the study will provide new insights into the behaviour of flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The excavations by scientists at the Scottish Peace Museum will follow the discovery of the pipistrelles and soprano pipistrelles with brown and long-eared claws and the Daubenton orchestra in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special sensors will be placed at different points in the product cycle to monitor the size of the glands in all the parents.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile phone screenings using handheld scans.
The sound results from all the sound recordings can help to determine how often the bats call and what each species does.
A map and custom report will be produced to create a more in-depth picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a climate consultant for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas are most important to communities and how they use each.
This information will help to determine the usefulness of local management tasks such as resource production and how best to manage the forest of the dragonfly and other species.
The number of leopards in Scotland and other parts of Britain has declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that involve tears and loss of habitat.
Wind and electric light can be dangerous, as can newspapers and some chemical building materials, and can be the result of attacks by domestic animals.
The fact is that the goats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal nature, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a range-finding system to detect insects and other objects that are moving in their path.
NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of more than 270 museums, 38 public gardens and 76,000 acres of land in the country, considers the monuments and pilots to be of great importance.
He had ten pilgrims, frequent explorers, collected museums and occasionally rescued.
The industry has also opened Scotland's first-ever single-celled primate reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfires and Galloway, which houses 8 of Scotland's 10 primate species.
Property manager David Thompson said the property was the most suitable for them.
"We have a good place here in Troas for the pilgrims.
We have old houses, old wooden ones, and a nice living quarters.
But there is much more to the unknown, so our work on this treasure will help us to identify some of the factors that are needed for it to flourish.
He stressed the importance of digging the nest before the property is managed as it is possible that the destruction of the nesting site could lead to the deaths of up to 400 of the women and their children, which could potentially wipe out the bird population of the area.
The mobs are thus protected from being destroyed, disturbed or disturbed or their homes destroyed.
Elisabeth Ferrel, of the University of Scotland's Department of Emergency Management, called for people to join forces to help.
She said: We have much to learn about the butterflies and their many species but we do not know how many they are.
Ronaldo denied the rape allegations during the preparations for the appeal of a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of rape on "fake news", saying people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers were preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly later paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the matter, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking through his Instagram video with 142 million followers hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the report as "fake news".
But I said to them, 'No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, the story is false, the five Ballon d'Or winners are in the camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That is a good point.
They wanted to make a name for themselves by mentioning my name, but it was a work in progress.
"I am a person who is calm and everything is okay", the actor added, smiling.
Ronaldo's defense lawyers are planning to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "unproven reports of allegations by the private sector", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the actor would seek a fine for "depravity", in an amount commensurate with the severity of the crime, which may be the worst human rights violation in decades.
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a lobby of the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's bedroom, where he allegedly raped her in the night, according to documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga admitted that Ronaldo fell on his knees afterwards and said she was a 99 percent "good guy" who gets a reaction from the one percent.
Their document acknowledged that Ronaldo believed that the two had had sexual relations, but only in a consensual way.
Mayorga also admitted that she went to the police and photographed her injuries in hospital, but later settled out of court because she was afraid of retaliation and worried about being bullied in public.
The 34-year-old is now trying to reverse the settlement as she continues to face the pain of her past.
Ronaldo was on his way to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and the same day he joined Italian giants Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will forever have to face the loss of automakers
The UK would have known forever if it had lost its position as the leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Labour Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily sell off operations at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delay at the national border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which includes Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year of which 90 percent were exported to the rest of Europe.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a call for tenders in our factory", said Mavin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Some UK carmakers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on what cross-border trade would look like, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is linked to what the automakers have said about the risk of supplying infrastructure if Brexit is not negotiated.
Toyota's automation system is implemented on a gab-and-time system, whereby parts arrive or a 37-minute drive from suppliers both from the UK and EU for vehicles called sari.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be problems at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It is not possible for Toyota to handle more than a day's worth of equipment at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so it will buy jobs.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's anti-EU investigative system was originally designed to avoid such investigations at the border.
"We need to find a deal. We want to find the best deal that gives us the right as I said not only the success we are enjoying at the moment but to be able to use that right", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The argument not only of Toyota but also of other furnaces is that we are the original need to keep the success of the production process.
Toyota failed to predict how long the work will be sold, but in the long run, they warned that prices would reduce the industry's competitiveness and lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the spokesperson for the industry's trade union, said its members remain concerned: "In my experience once these projects go they never come back".
A government spokesman said: We have submitted a fair and transparent framework for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be pushed forward a week as the fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueler, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, links between Trump's staff and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump would fire the assistant attorney general, thus putting Mueller's freedom at risk, has been a buzzword in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked by phone with his recording agent about Trump and the possibility of impeaching the President on 25.
Rosenstein denied the reports.
But last Monday he went to the White House, reportedly to give a reception.
Instead, his meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and a woman accusing him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Congressional elections.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sara Saunders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "There is no date for this, it could be this week, I think it could be a week later based on all the things going on in the high court.
But we will see and we will continue to give you the news".
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: Sanders has not given a speech at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the absence was not due to a problem with the TV audience, "although she added: "I will not deny the fact that they are valuable".
She then suggested seeing Trump directly would increase press coverage.
"The president has done more Q&A peacefully than any president before him", she said, without pointing out any evidence: "We looked at these numbers".
The speech will still be delayed, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States the questions, it's better to do it directly than to talk to me.
We've tried to do this very hard and you've seen us do it very hard over the last few weeks and that will be the case of a brief speech when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump usually answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending an open house or press conference with visiting guests.
Covering up press coverage is difficult.
In New York City this week, the president revealed why, he was making his rights known and coming out at odd times before he assembled the press.
Health secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working for the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude for the country and wish to stay post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months to travel until Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already made efforts to meet the costs of providing services to EU citizens working in the public sector.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, leading to this grand decision.
But the British Government has continued to prepare for possible imbalances.
I know this must be a time of uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize once again how worthy of respect is each worker's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Partners from across the EU, and beyond, provide valuable experience to strengthen and improve the healthcare profession, and benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland has become our home and we would love for you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie Surgically Treated for a Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, the Tennessee Organic team reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred before halftime.
It went straight to the sideline and here it fell, Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on the bed and returning him for further evaluation.
An official from Western Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrobie had just come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that "there is no detailed information on the type/size of the injuries sustained" and that the State of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injuries occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore tight end, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five shots on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his score to 18.
Overseas buyers will be charged higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK
Buyers of cross-border property will be charged a higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK with the extra cash used to help the homeless under the new Tory scheme
This move would undermine Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The stamp will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The savings bank expects to raise up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Overseas buyers are expected to be charged higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK - with additional money being spent on helping the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move would be seen as an attempt to derail Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises to provide affordable housing and to push for stricter policies.
The stamp act would raise money for individuals and corporate tax avoidance in the UK, with additional funds to support the government's efforts to tackle insomnia.
The increase - which is in addition to the current sealing process, including measures introduced in the last two years on two homes and the purchase of rental units - could be as much as three percent.
The Reserve expects it to rise to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that around 13 per cent of new London furniture is being purchased from foreigners living in Britain, and the rising costs are making it difficult for first-time buyers to find accommodation.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who mostly do not live in the country.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp challenge to help young people who own their own home.
He accused the major construction companies of storing up expensive inventory by taking up land without using it, and urged Mrs May to leave the revenue on the housing to solve "the housing crisis in Britain".
Mr Corbyn announced a package of planned housing reforms, including a rental scheme and an end to the 'non-proliferation' of goods.
He also wanted to give the legislature the authority to build buildings.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate myself to restoring the British dream - that life is better for every new generation.
And that means repairing the ruined shops.
Britain will remain open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not unreasonable that it is easier for non-UK residents, and for foreign companies, to buy homes as hard as British residents.
For many the dream of owning a home has become too remote, and the anguish of a bad night's sleep becomes more real".
Jack Ross: 'My main goal is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "goal" was to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The Scot, 42, is delighted to challenge the return of the North-East championship club, who are currently third in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League.
"I wanted to play for her country.
I got a B hat and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Voice of Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and he had something that was so funny.
This opportunity will come, however, if I succeed in running the organization".
Those who had preceded Ross as Sunderland managers included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic president said he was not afraid of what these names had set up at such a big club, after the bidding war between Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The question for me at the time was 'Can I get the team back to the Premier League?'
Given the structure and resources in this group, it is not surprising that we of the Fremian Plain, "he said.
"It was not easy to get him there, but I can see myself as a success here if I can get the team there".
Ross's only three years in management, followed by a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months at Hearts' apprenticeship sports management.
He also helped Alloa to promotion back to the third tier, and turned St Mirren from their Championship role the following season.
And Ross said he felt better than he ever did during his playing days at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It became impossible and confusing", he recalls, taking over Alloa.
"I really believe that management is better for me, than playing.
It was amazing because I had worked hard, had a good life, and enjoyed some prestige.
But playing can be challenging.
You will have many new experiences each week.
I am still working on this issue in terms of the difficulties and pressures of the project but the management felt right.
I always wanted to run, and now I am, and I am happy to be in the shuttle all my life".

The full pint time was 5.30pm on Saturday, the survey showed
The heat has boosted participation in the competing British resort but added pressure on restaurants.
Resorts and bars saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July but restaurants fell 4.8 percent, figures show.
Peter Martin, CGA's marketing director, who included the figures, said: "It continued to shine with England more than expected to qualify for the World Cup in July, which followed a similar trend to the previous June, when it was 2.8 per cent, except most restaurants were more crowded.
The 1.8 percent drop in retail food sales in June alone was worse in July.
The bars and pubs were more robust and more diverse than the restaurants that were on the ground.
Food stores also suffered during the day, but not to the extent of restaurant workers.
It seems that the people wanted to go out and get a drink.
In all the establishments where alcohol and soft drinks are sold, the figure is 6.6 per cent for the month, and food is less than 3 per cent".
Paul Newman, a tourism analyst and RSM professor, says: "These results have been consistent since the end of April.
The climate and the impact of major social events or sporting events are also major factors when it comes to selling in the domestic market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, to keep the drop to 4.8 percent per year because it would be a serious pain on the price pressure facing.
A prolonged heat wave could not have come at the worst possible time for food processors like this and time would have to tell the most average weather we experienced in August would have produced the necessary delay".
Total sales revenue across bars and restaurants, including openings, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the company's output.
The Coffer Peach Tracker tracks UK businesses, the bar and restaurant sector collecting and analysing economic data from 47 active organisations, an increase of more than $9 billion, and is the industry's primary source of signage.
One in five children has a personal website that hides their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has a personal Web site that hides their parents and teachers, research shows
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows an increase in fake Instagram
The article further honors the fear that sexual information is being published
Twenty percent of students said they had a real website that pointed to parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - set up a website that hides adults.
A study of 20,000 schoolchildren revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta pages - references and sharing of photos on the social networking site Instagram.
The article further honored the fear that sexual material was being published.
Twenty percent of the children said they used the "real" clean site to show parents, while they had private ones.
A mother who consulted her 13-year-old daughter's personal website found a teenager begging others to "rape me".
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of private schools, found 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two accounts, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that many young people are interested in opening websites where their parents and teachers will not be able to detect them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the players" at the Scottish Sports Authority
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of the Scottish Sports Authority as a sub-director at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete and manager Ian Beattie has described this as a very promising position for those leading the sport to have the opportunity to use at the international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected among the Scottish community, the UK and the international athletic community, and we are sure the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing her to the committee", Beattie said.
"I am interested in doing voice work for athletes and I hope to contribute and help manage sport in Scotland", Doyle said.
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Games in Atlanta in his four Olympic medals combined and is now a regular BBC pundit, has been unable to walk after battling a limited form of anemia.
He wrote on Twitter: Today is a month since I had a near-death experience.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was a grueling job but he made a full recovery, learned to walk again and today he is doing some exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
An advertisement for a breast tattoo depicting mothers as cows has spread opinion on the internet
A breast tattoo company has circulated online a photo and advertisement depicting nursing mothers and cows being tattooed.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first implantable breast tattoo machine", the technology company Elvie has released a colorful music video to highlight the freedom the new pump has given mothers.
The real mothers danced in a dance-floor to the song that contained the following statements: "Yes, I am a headless, but you have not seen my tail" and "If you have not noticed that these are not my breasts, these are my breasts".
Ihun continued: "Put it, put it, I feed the children, put it, put it, I rub my mother's breast".
However, the ad, which was published on the company's website, caused a stir on the internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reviews from viewers, with many comments expressing "disgust" for the dairy industry.
It is a bad idea to use cows to advertise this product.
It seems like we should be pregnant and giving birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from their home after they are born, someone wrote.

Another said: "There is a lot of anxiety between mother and baby.
But why not use the promotional pump for parents who want to save their babies?
Another added: The number is meaningless.
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "delightful".
"I think that was a wise suggestion.
I bought one and I still drink it.
The cattle knew the machine like a cow.
The advertising of the truth is a bit crazy but I take it for what it is.
"I think that's very professional advice", someone wrote.
Another says: tallar is a purposeful entertainment for women who are sneaking around (especially in the workplace or toilet) and feel like they are sweating.
This is not a complimentary advertisement or a milk company complaint.
At the end of the video the women's group shows that they are dancing wearing a pump-style dress on their breasts.
The main focus of the campaign is on research that women who breastfeed feel like pigs.
Elvie's soap, however, has no head, no wires or tubes and fits into a breast-feeding jacket, allowing women freedom to move around, hold babies, and even go outside while they are soaking.
Ana Balarin, partner with ECD and parent commented: Elvie's phone is a revolutionary product that is well suited to bold and unpredictable presentation.
By drawing a line between the description of women and cows we put the breast tattoo and all the challenges in the light, while showing in an interesting context and how it can be shown that the freedom that the new pump will bring.
this is not the first time Elvie's pump has been in the news.

Hundreds of refugee children slowly make their way to a proud camp on the Texas border
The number of refugee children being detained has increased although the monthly border coordinates have remained unchanged, in part because disapproval of policies proposed by the Trump administration has made it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were illegal immigrants, and they were afraid to gain their own right to stay in the country by continuing to seek children.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that sponsors and other minority residents at home would provide their handwriting, and information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the House that the agency had arrested several people who sought to support underage children.
The commission later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who have support or local support are in the country illegally, and a large part of those are criminals.
So we keep following these people", said Mr. Albence.
Seeking to expedite the execution of the children, officials have introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, instead of after 60 days, which is the standard period, according to the regulators.
Many would come out via video conference call, rather than in person, to be transported to a courtroom, as a judge.
Those who are judged unworthy of help are not reinstated.
Most of their children are in a secure home, most likely to experience trauma or shock, which could lead to violence or attempted escape, according to law enforcement officials and recent reports from the system.
Advocates say that the most affected are the older homes like Tornillo's, where the signs are that the struggling child is more likely to be abandoned, due to his size.
They add that sending children back to the tent city without enough time to prepare their minds or to calm their fears can add to the frustration that many suffer.
Sham tells the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw without delay
In a speech to the UN, Foreign Minister al-Moualem called on the refugees to return home, despite the country's war now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said the country's military is in Sham illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and will be dealt with appropriately.
"They must withdraw without delay and without any conditions", he told the crowd.
Moualem insisted that the war on terrorism is almost over in Sham, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, with millions of people homeless.
He said Damascus would continue its war against the king until all Shamans were cleared of all terrorist groups and "any officials present without authorization".
The US has some 2,000 troops in Sham, mostly to train and advise Kurdish and Arab Sham forces that are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France had more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the situation has made them return, and blamed some Western countries for "inciting unwarranted fear" that refugees refuse to return.
"We call on international and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return", he said.
They are political and purely a matter of personal preference.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided for the reconstruction of Sham until an agreement is reached between Assad and the war-torn rebels.
UN liaison officials say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to separate the last major rebel-held region of Idlib from the rest of the region provides a window for further political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement ended a major offensive by pro-Russian Shams in the region, home to three million people.
Moualem however stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would focus on "terrorists" along with fighters from the Nusra Front affiliated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be dealt with".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is expected to soon convene the first meeting of a committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a constitution after the war in Sham and opens the way for elections.
Moualem issued a statement that would allow the Sham government to join the committee, calling for the suspension of the parties' work "to review the current constitution", and warning of interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
Under this strategy, Mr. Trump would win re-election for a second term in 2020 unless, as many Liberal Party members expected, the scandal and scandal ended his presidency before his term.
In no doubt it will be the most amazing end of leadership ever!
For now, there is no sign of the viewer's tiredness.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have jumped more than two homes to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly three shows to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" influenced the ratings with viewership figures as high as 3.5 million on prime-time news nights.
"This is a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, host of the ABC show "Designated Survivor", about the congressional secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, former comedy writer and author of "Just Parts of Laughing: And Some Funny Facts About Making a Pledge to the Hollywood Male Circle", has a different idea.
She recalled a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said she would vote for Mr. Trump.
The son of what? she asked.
"What", "Because it makes me laugh", Mr. Scovell said.
There is value in entertainment in the midst of chaos.
Well, unlike anything on TV, the news coming out of Washington could determine the outcome of Roe v. Wade, whether refugees can be reunited and the global economy healthy.
The exodus was a sacred act that only select travelers could perform.
And in that, it's more than being a national celebrity when you find yourself in the six hours of watching their panel of experts discuss the use of Bob Woodward's "Deep Data" searching for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather gym jacket (a thick, expensive piece, the Washington Post says) and the importance of the information, um, the body of Mr. Trump and Stormy Daniel.
I, especially, will not watch Super Mario as much as I used to.
"One of the things he does that makes it look like a game of thrones is feed you something every night", said Brent Mongomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars, on Trump's game of player-turned-system (the NFL's choice to fight, and Kim Jong-un's praise).
You do not want to lose any limbs or be left behind.
When I found Mr. Fleiss this weekend, it was sunny to 80 degrees outside his home on the northern tip of Kauai, but he was hiding inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get his head out of the situation, not with Brett Kavanaugh face to face with the House Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we used to play jokes back then and people said, 'this is the beginning of science,'" Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was just a joke, but it turned out to be true.

Foreign currency has filled the closest midterm elections for members of parliament
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is making a lot of money, thanks to the realignment it has brought to two governors in the same seat race.
This new outpost system in Pittsburgh included Democratic Congressman Conor Lamb - who won the seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running alongside fellow Congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, representing Pennsylvania's former 12th District, which is closely tied to the new 17th.
The map was redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the boundaries of the old counties had been unlawfully merged to favor the Republicans.
The draft in the new 17th Congress opened the way for a financial competition between the two major party funding agencies, the Democratic Congressional Electoral Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Electoral Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a landslide victory in a highly-watched special election in March for the 18th Pennsylvania State Legislature.
This seat has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts gave the Democratic Party a slight lead.
The United States Reviews the Sanctions against El Salvador in Support of China, and then Disappears
Liaison officials noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already been contacted by Beijing, with a small number of contacts from Washington.
Mr. Trump held an inaugural meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until business associates fired the Trump administration.
Department officials have decided to reinstate senior U.S. diplomats in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the recent ruling to cease testimony on Taiwan, Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But only nine were studied for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development support and economic development.
The study's conclusions, which include cutbacks in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have hurt Central America, which is suffering from high unemployment and homicide.
While the in-house meeting was underway, North and Central American officials suspended a wide-ranging conference on security and economic prosperity for the remainder of last year's meeting, which was seen as a step in an effort to stop migrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, officials expressed their desire that the conference continue, in a way that would end the sentence against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to make a statement at the summit, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of bringing government affairs to the summit, the ambassador said.
And three U.S. diplomats have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the detailed discussion described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the secret inside.
their statements were confirmed by an analyst who is close to the government and spoke in a secret environment.
Read the History
The next shoe to drop may be that of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possible impeachment of Mr. Trump, which now has a lot of evidence in the public record.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller has turned his attention to finding out whether Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If the Congress does not act, Mr. Trump will find himself accused of taking responsibility for this coalition, as he is preparing to return to the electorate, and she is probably among his supporters.
There are many question marks, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's fall is impossible - just that of his generation in Europe.
We all had to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic that would affect how long a long-distance struggle we might have to go through.
In 1938, German officials planned a coup against Hitler, if the West rejected him and sided with the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid years of bloodshed.
Their historical record warns of such a problem, and democracy is being carried out without hurry or delay.
Americans have experienced much of this current fatigue.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who was leading Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since the same paper reported that, last year, he secretly advised the president and considered his ineptitude for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was inaccurate.
"What would we do if the new FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh was incomplete or untrue - or if it was upheld in the Supreme Court despite numerous allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And all in all, are we going to vote in the middle for a legislature that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, democracy will be in the long winter.
But the battle was not lost, because of the training I had received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to the United States, and some 60 years later she sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a swastika table there.
With this as my legacy, how can I not be too conservative about the future?

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is in a fight before the Rapid Vienna match
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, where they knew that a win over the Austrians, after scoring in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first start of the season to a 2-2 draw against Villarreal but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a youth to bigger things.
"This is a good point for us because Villarreal is good", said the 31-year-old.
"We started the game believing we could get something and we survived by one point
We might have overcome them eventually, but, in general, the horse's ears can be a good result.
They were better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the best side.
Thursday night was another night in Europe.
We hope, we can get three points but that will be a difficult problem because they had a good result in the final but, with the crowd of our fans, I am sure we can push for a good result.
Last year was difficult, between the incident and my injury and the changes in the team but now there are signs of improvement in the current place.
The team was well organized and the children were so happy; exercise was good.
Hopefully, we can push now, put the season behind us and win".
Women lose sleep because of fear of losing their retirement savings
Although the participants had a different opinion about how they wanted to be treated, few of them talked about it with their relatives.
Nearly half of those surveyed nationwide said that they discussed long-term financial arrangements with their wives.
Only 10 percent have spoken to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by their relatives, but they don't take the initiative to communicate", says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Insurance Board.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You will not prepare your family for care if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
You work with your counselors and family to discuss who you can take care of, so that these options set the priorities for budgeting.
Consult a financial advisor: A financial advisor can help you to identify ways to pay for such expenses.
Your choice of long-term care insurance coverage may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a youth finance-critical insurance policy to help cover those costs or self-insurance with your own Canadian-funded expenses.
Bring your legal documents: Put an end to the legal battles of the past.
Contact a local health care representative to arrange for a trusted health care provider and to make sure that the professional takes care of your needs even if you cannot speak.
Also consider the power of attorney for your finances.
You would appoint a trusted adviser to make the final decisions about your finances and to make sure that the bills are paid even if you cannot afford them.
remember the details: Imagine that your aging parent is in an urgent need of medical attention.
Can you answer questions about medication and illness?
Write these details on a notepad so that you can prepare.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit Palu on Friday, officials said, with more deaths expected.
Due to the lack of communication, security officials did not receive any information from Donggala regency, a region in northern Palu that was closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster began.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located on the western coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was commemorating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a system that runs along more than 300 miles (180 km) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The constituency, a lower-level local government area in the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
agriculture are the main economic drivers of Sulawesi province, especially the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the southern tip of Sulawesi.
Paman and Donggala have been hit by more tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami struck the western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is prone to earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake off the western coast of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit western Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that swept across the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that devastated several small towns and killed about 300 people.
2016: A massive earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people are reminded of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit in 2004.
No tsunami occurred during that time, but more than 100 people died in the collapse.
2018: A massive earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily in a state of shock.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of sexual assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as interfering with reports of domestic violence and, according to a report released by Alaska State Troopers, on Saturday.
According to police reports, when a woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away from her.
Palin was held in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 bail agreement, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "in fact innocent" when questioned, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class I felonies, meaning he could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It was not the first time Palin had been charged with a serious crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with the murder of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Supreme Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic crimes, aggravated domestic violence reporting, and possession of a weapon while at high risk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of beating her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in the case by veterans' groups in 2016 after linking her family's attitudes to PTSD from her service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down with more deaths expected in the coming days.
The quake struck just off central Sulawesi in the northeastern Indonesian city of Jakarta.
The video is on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Palu City to celebrate the tsunami.
Federal prosecutors seeking death penalty for NYC terrorist
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City bombing that killed eight people - the state's highest death sentence for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, used local motor vehicles to carry out attacks on the motorway and along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, launching at pedestrians and bicycles on his route in October.
To secure the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight people and "accidentally" caused serious bodily injury, according to the announcement of the death penalty petition, filed in the Southern District of New York.
All those considered were sentenced to death, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts including eight counts of murder for aiding and abetting, most of which were prosecuted in felony conspiracy, and one count of aggravated assault and vehicular destruction.
The attack required "serious preparation and preparation", the prosecutors said, explaining how Saipov viewed him as "vicious, cruel and unkind".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, illness, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement of intent states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina
Ten years have passed since the Southern District of New York reinstated the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two nuclear-powered bombers but was sentenced to death in September 2009.
The last was when a federal death sentence was handed down in New York in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple after they had been convicted of conspiring for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he was pleased with what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was convinced to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the allegation.
He also demanded that the Isis flag be displayed in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 of the charges.
David Patton, one of the federal civil rights activists in Saipov state, said they were "concerned" with the decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction to life in prison without the possibility of parole will overcome the problems that are happening to everyone", Patton said.
Saipov's defense attorneys asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be given attention to Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to rebel today during a protest at the Tory convention.
The former Ukip leader said politicians were 'hot on the spot' from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's deputies suggested she should consider negotiations with the EU.
A recent backer, Peter Bone, told reporters in Birmingham that the UK would now leave if Mr Farage became Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May's difficulties in negotiating and the fractious multi-party negotiations suggest that the Pro-Remain Tories are engaging in a major Brexit protest in the city.
Freemia is struggling with management issues and its analysts have been preparing for a roadblock in the wake of attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Friends insisted that she pushed ahead with her efforts to strike a deal with Brussels despite the consequences - and forced Europeans and Labour to choose between her and 'the revolution'.
Mr Bone told AFP news agency that he wanted to 'see' the 'Investigators'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be a candidate and give responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been watching, we would have left now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand by Brexit but we need to look at the investigators.'
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight the world wars to be inferior.
We want to make our own laws in our country.'
Mr Bone dismissed the fact that public opinion and opinion had changed since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to be right is wrong.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was on the march, telling reporters: I'm just saying: The Frem minister listened to the people.
'The investigators are not rigid with the public, the Opposition would not have voted, without our party and our activists, who have ruined the streets and made us vote from the beginning.
Please download the Explorers and start listening.'
In the message shown to Mrs May, she added: 'Their Prime Ministers continue their work if they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage told politicians that politicians must first 'feel the pain' if they want to defeat the fraudulent 2016 referendum.
'This is now about the issue of how to deal with us - the people - and with the politicians,' he said.
'They are trying to cheat Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not let you go and do that'.
In a message to the cheering crowd he added: 'I want you to make our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel pain.
'We are mobilizing the armed forces of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, sovereign, and Proud British.'
Meanwhile, the Remainers toured Birmingham before a two-hour tour of the city centre
The radical activist raised the Tories' candidacy on Brexit after the party was launched over the holidays.
Labour Lord Adonis complained to the Conservatives about the security problems they suffered with the party's application during the opening session.
"These are the same people who told us that they can have the IT system in one place and all the technology of the Canadian-speaking world, for cross-border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
'It was a complete joke.
There is nothing as good as Brexit, he added.
Warren will make "a good study" of his Presidential Candidacy
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth said she would "do a good job studying the Presidential candidacy" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against GOP congressman Geoff Diehl, who was the 2016 Massachusetts Trump campaign chairman.
She was at the center of the debate that she might run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon rally in Holyoke was the 36th meeting of its residents and using the city hall system since Trump took office.
One of the delegates asked her if she was considering running for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our government and that includes the women upstairs".
Arrested in the shooting death of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at the ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man seen in the photos.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", police chief Murphy J. Paul said Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend who was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being there, with a gun and a gun on him, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident, and he was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge police station.
A 6-foot-6 kid who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes the World Cup when fans give him a chance to beat Sebastian Vettel
It has been clear since Valtteri Bottas qualified against Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' drivers will play a key role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas started well and almost hung Hamilton to dry while defending his position in the top two and invited Vettel to attack the opponent.
Vettel entered the first pitch and left Hamilton to enter the traffic at the tail end of the pack, an event that should have been decisive.
Mercedes crossed the line later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a crash with a Ferrari driver who left him unceremoniously in a good position to hold on after two attempts to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place after the end of the first period on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race while holding the tire to reach the finish line quickly and gained a lead over Kimi Raikkonen in fourth.
He then entered the field on lap 44 but was unable to improve his form in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen came in fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri had worked well all weekend and was so modest that he told me.
The team did a good job of winning one and two, Hamilton said.
This is a bad sign
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a news conference on Saturday over her allegation that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Addressing a patrol in West Virginia, the president gave Ford's address to a Senate judicial committee, instead of saying that the proceedings in the Senate had been characterized as "a disgraceful lie".
"Something can happen and something good happens in the last few days in the Senate, when they you see angry people, when you see angry and cruel people and unfaithful liars", he said.
If you look at the release of the confidential information and they say "you, not me".
I did not.
Do you recall?
Dianne Feinstein, are you out?
Remember her answer ... did you pull out that paper - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't take it out.
Well, wait a minute.
Did we export it... No, we did not export it", he added, as the senator pointed out.
A letter containing the charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein from Ford in July, and the document came out in early September - but Feinstein denied the allegation that the document came from inside the office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Charges, I didn't release her story", Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"She told me to keep it a secret and I did as she told me".
But her disapproval did not seem to have gained him the support of the president, who commented during a Saturday night patrol meeting: I'll tell you something, This is a terrible sign of physical abuse.
Maybe not, but that was the worst body image I've ever seen".
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who is accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president recommended that the Democrats use the charges to pursue their claims.
They are determined to take power at any cost.
You see the evil, the injustice, they don't care about the sick, who will be sick to get power and power, Mediaite reported the president saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have made up for their Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning the match 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were the first to score two touchdowns by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the level before Dwyer resumed his leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored the winning goal against Dundee before Lucas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals became their victory.
This was only the third time the Elite League football champions have lost to Adam Keefe's team, who later beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning their last three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist and Beauvillier doubling the lead to two four minutes ahead.
The game was a disappointment from the start, Sullivan returning home the game in 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the assistant to beat Cownie's ears at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants led the game in the first period by scoring the second goal of the night at the end of that period.
The goalkeeper team changed their style and Buchard re-scored them with a stronger ball at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen to give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the two games and ensured that her victory in the team's fifth-place finish at the end of the game was final.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
A flight controller died to ensure the lives of the passengers survived the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and dozens more are missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, as it triggered a tsunami.
Small earthquakes of magnitude - or magnitude - continue to devastate the area, and many people are in disarray in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his job at the construction tower at Maniara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu Airport.
He went on to confirm that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was attempting to take off at the time, had taken off safely.
He jumped from the tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could save hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reports.
We boarded a ferry from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a large hospital in another town.
Sadly, we lost him that morning before the anchor ship reached Palu.
"Our hearts were overwhelmed at hearing this", he said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that deaths could reach thousands and the country's disaster mitigation agency said access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities was limited.
"It is believed that there is a possibility of an increase in the death toll as many bodies are under the wreckage while the number of them has not been recovered", said the spokesperson of the association Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A flood of about six meters damaged Palu where the bodies will be buried in the same place on Sunday.
Military and charter aircraft are delivering relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings in the bodies.
Clean water is hard to come by.
Small businesses are being hijacked everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is on the move to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It's sad, but it can be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I order you all to work day and night to complete all the projects related to export.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia Air Niugini crash claim one person missing after plane crash
The airline that operates the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now claims one person is missing, after saying that all 47 passengers and crew aboard the plane were rescued.
Air Niugini said in a release that as of Saturday evening, they have not been able to identify a single male.
The airline said it was working with authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about the passenger's age or nationality
traditional boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew after the plane sank while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said that on Friday seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, and all were in good condition.
The cause and exact sequence of events remained a mystery.
The Airline and the US Navy both said the plane landed in its riverbed due to a lack of runway.
Some witnesses thought that the boat had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed well.
"That is a good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to walk into the deep water to open the emergency door to the sinking ship.
The crew members were confused by the screams, and he suffered head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors were working nearby to improve the harbor and helped with rescue by using wind-powered boats to transport people to shore before the ship sank to 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Institute shows that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents over the past two decades but none have been involved with Air Niugini.
Investigators evacuated the camp during the night the woman was burned alive
The judge suspended his trial on Saturday when a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014 was sentenced.
U.S. Department of Justice investigator Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert eyewitness to the investigation.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone voice recording to track down the 29-year-old criminal Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, contradicting previous claims, according to Clarion Ledger.
When records showed that his phone was with Chambers' when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police contacted Sanford.
Sanford picked up the bags on Saturday and testified that he had not been to the town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "sleeping, because the car was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
phone records show that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He had erased her from his life", Hale said.
His defense hearings will begin on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the case to be referred to the jury later that day.

They wanted to go back to their roots and do hip hop that would restore their reputation.
Artists such as Fugees and Common have seen a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and LowKey.
A black man?!
NY childcare worker sues couple for eviction after "racist" post
A New York babysitter sues a couple for illegally evicting her after a letter addressed to her by a mother complaining that she is "a black woman too"
The couple denied that they were racist, that the case was related to the abduction
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed concern when it was discovered that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black from her arrival on her first day of work in 2016.
"A LOT of hope", Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, "disgruntled" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, who explained that her former employee, who was African-American, had acted in a bad way and expected to be brought in as a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Currently, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation on her salary, and she is seeking a child's payment of $350 a day for six months, as is the rental of a job she was hired for, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, there's no such thing", she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's because of prejudice".
The couple replied that we did not show any signs of racism, saying that it was the right thing to do to expel Maurice, because they were afraid she would not trust them after the crime.
My wife even pushed through something that was not meant to be a fight.
It does not discriminate.
we are not racists, Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But will you give your children to someone who has been wrong, even if it is wrong?
The newborn?
Not at all.
He described the case as "a bit of a shock", Plasco said his wife was less than two months pregnant with her baby and was therefore in a "difficult situation".
"Would you support something like that?
This is not good", said an investment banker.
While the trial was going on, the court of public opinion quickly found the couple on the news media, criticizing them for their behavior and the system.
Paddington publishers fear readers will not want to be associated with the talking doll, a new letter reports
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It is good to know now what we know about Paddington's great victory".
Saying that her father, who worked as a photographer for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book through Little Dolls, would have known where the book had gone, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "difficult and sweet" after his death last year.
From Paddington, who described herself as "the most important member of our family", she said that her father was proud of his great success.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not proud", she said.
"But because Paddington was so honest with him, he said that your son had achieved something great: you would be proud of them even if it wasn't so.
I think he saw the success of Paddington, in this way.
Though he was his own creation and his own mind, he always paid homage to Paddington himself".
Her daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"I kept calling him and saying that it was too bad, that I would not fly", recalls Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said: "Rise, my beloved, my beloved one.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medication doctors had given to keep his heart working, slowly stopped it from working and stopped it from working.
She died a few times before and that covers it all.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that everything was going to be solved.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by family and people.
I tried my best to stay calm.
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, still grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - regardless of the tragedy she was in.
Nobody knows, she is.
I lay on the floor, and I cried all the time.
It was very difficult to explain, but it was on the train that I began to feel a deep compassion for Nad.
How he needed my love and understanding.
About how much he loves her.
Silent women send cards to stop the killers on the bridge
Two women who lost their lovers to suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys would then send cards on the Welsh Bridge with messages of inspiration and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I do all the time", she says.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a pain-filled donor.
Everyone recognized him by his smile.
They often say that his smile lights up every room.
Yet, he left the project before his death, while he was "in darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the first to discover the body after his brother took his own life.
"I'm still worried that there's a possibility of a hit on the result", Ms. Davis said.
Ms. Davis designed the cards, "to let people know there are people you can reach out to and talk to, even if they are friends.
Don't stay silent - you should speak.
Ms Humphreys, who had been a friend of Ms Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, after the death of his mother shortly after.
"He didn't say he was unhappy or depressed or anything", she said.
"Two days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at the base of the cliff on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents he refused to look at them.
She says that his death was a big problem for them, but they had to work through it: "It leaves a hole in the family.
It confused us.
But we must continue to live and struggle.

Brett Kavanaugh's whereabouts hang in the balance, as the FBI begins an investigation
"I think, if we can get something like what he's asking for - just a short-term, limited-term study - how can we bring a little bit of cooperation", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears the committee "is divided" over the amount of political opinion.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The lack of love for them is a result of time.
The midterm elections are five weeks from now, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans don't make an effort, then they will be hit hard in their bid to tie the man they want nominated to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was on the phone calling Senators, pleading with them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces a report?
Elections will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to overturn the offer and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Retirement numbers in North Korea declined under Kim
The number of North Koreans who have resigned to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power in the last seven years, a South Korean policy analyst said.
Park Byeong-seug, who quoted data from the Southern Cooperation Ministry, said there was a decrease of 1,127 layoffs last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said increased border security between North Korea and China and rising prices from insect thieves were the main reasons.
Pyongyang did not comment on the matter earlier.
Most North Korean retirees are awarded South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people have fled China, which has a long border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers retirees to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and therefore takes them back.
Relations between the North and the South - still at war - improved within a few months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks related to the nuclear disarmament talks.
This comes after the historic June summit between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they approved an agreement that would lead to the country's nuclear disarmament.
After the June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, they agreed to sign an agreement to use the Northeastern Republic of Congo.
"Without the trust of the United States, we cannot guarantee our security, and in such circumstances, there is no way to destroy our weapons ourselves", Mr Ri said in his speech to the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "ridiculous", saying he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court".
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune concert in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman ever did something like that, they would say 'funny,'" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before a Senate committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh in a sympathetic tone denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both children.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh expressed his deepest sympathy, sometimes almost screaming and wailing as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also openly criticized the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him "a terrorist, moral-crime plot", orchestrated by the rebels, angry that Hillary Clinton had fallen in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she agreed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it discriminated against Democrats.
"I think that he showed his incompetence with these statements and the way he treated the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then not only is the Supreme Court unfit for him, but the current court is unfit for him", Pelos said.
Kavanaugh now serves as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the possibility of Kavanaugh's decision on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was being judged to be a conservative judge.
In a confident hearing, Kavanaugh asked some questions about whether he would overturn some Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for a joke, which doesn't want to go to court and hopes we say, 'It's not weird,'" Pelos said.
And Women Need to Use It.
With just respect, months and years of anger passed, and she could not let go, without crying.
"We would cry when we were angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's really cool, you know?"
She continued, "I got help from a lady who was the leader of a household, who said she cried when she was angry, but she kept using the technique which means when she was angry and started crying, she said to the man she was talking to, "You can imagine I'm sad because I'm crying.
I was furious".
Then she continued on her way.
And I thought that was a good thing".
The ball is coming out due to a fault in the section due to a misunderstanding.
One of the greatest memories from my first job, in a man-dominated office, where I once cried with unending rage, was when an elderly lady seemed to be in a neck-and-neck position - then a modest boss whom I always doubted - rushed up the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry", she told me.
They do not realize that you are angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to see you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in an adulterous affair in a Monkey Business boat and dropped out of the race, Ms Schroeder was deeply frustrated, stating that there was no reason to prevent the idea of expanding until she ran for president herself.
"It was not a good idea", she admits with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were seven other contestants in the race, and all they needed was someone else.
One called it "Snow White with Seven Splints".
Because she was late in the campaign, she was behind in earnings, so she promised not to run unless she won $2 million.
This was a losing battle.
She found out that some of her fans had given $1,000 to men who would give her only $250.
 Do you think I'm better? She is surprised.
When she made her speech that she would not launch a campaign, she said with sympathy - thanks to the people who supported her, frustration at the system that came with difficult financing and the execution of voters instead of representatives, and anger at gender - that she was satisfied with it.
"You would think I was a psychopath", recalls Ms. Schroeder of the pressures she was under.
"You think Kleenex is a weight-loss system.
I remember thinking, who will they put on my grave?
Did you cry?
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The intentions to start a trade war between the US and China are strong, and the problem is not permanent at the moment, between the two countries and could be good for Beijing for the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, had warned earlier this year by imposing tariffs on China's key export products, including solar panels, steel and dalmatian.
The biggest increase this week was with tariffs covering $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, so as to cover a quarter of the goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has compensated all in one way, recently raising tariffs from five percent to 10 percent on $60 billion of US goods.
China has vowed to use the US's shoot-me-first-shoot-you system, and which of the two major economies in the world is not prepared to compromise anytime soon.
Making Washington withdraw also means a return to the quest, but publicly withdrawing the US would be more embarrassing to Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, the United States can support China in the long run by reducing economic dependence.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in Washington or Beijing could lead to a situation that could depress the economy of any country is more dangerous than observers have previously admitted", says Abigail Grace, a researcher overseeing Asia at the American Institute for New Security, a think tank.
Syria is ready to take back refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is secretly accepting returning refugees who have begged for help in rebuilding the country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and it is appreciated the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to repair the areas damaged by the terrorists in order to restore peace.
All the conditions are now in place for returning refugees to the country they left due to terrorism and economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their environment.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people living in their country are in need of relief.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the country that was destroyed.
However, he stressed that he would not accept any support, or assistance, from countries that had supported the violence.
Europe to the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup and defeated the United States in the 2018 final. The match ended with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight to Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown with Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scoring the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
Outstanding American champion Phil Mickelson, who had scored the game-winning goal, threw a par-3 into the water on the 16th hole, beating Francesco Molinari for his shot.
Italian golfer Molinari shone through all the goals, becoming the first player to go 1-for-4 in a 5-0-0 streak since the tournament's inception in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated on 5&4 by the lowest placed player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's leading scorer, fell 2 to 1 to Ian Poulter of England who played in the final Ryder Cup.
Former eight-time Ryder champion Serbia Garcia became the European Cup all-time leading scorer with 25.5 points.
I used to cry, but now I can't help it.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas took me and made me feel at home.
I was happy, so happy that I had returned the cup again.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to be able to help", said Garcia in a sad mood after the European victory.
He handed the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who launched the American football game Tiger Woods 2 & 1 in Sunday's individual match.
"The pride I felt, to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy", says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A stunning statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, he won 14 titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled over the weekend to find the best routes without Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf in both events.
Captain Jim Furyk of the United States spoke after the disappointment of the game to his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a time that morning when we set the heat on Europe.
We are exhausted.
My regards to Thomas.
He was a captain.
All 12 players played well.
We'll reconnect, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I loved those 12 men and was proud to serve as captain.
You have to put your hat on.
We were severely beaten
