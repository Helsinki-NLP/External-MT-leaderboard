The lion is the most social of cats, living in large groups called herds.
The flock consisted of one to three adult males who had relatives together with about thirty sons and daughters.
"Women are often closely related in a family of sisters and daughters".
The lion herd acts like a wolf herd or a dog, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and are also dangerous to prey.
Like an all-around athlete, a shrew can climb (though not very well), swim, jump, and pull with five times the pull of a healthy person.
The only cats that can bark are the lions, the leopards, and the spotted leopards.
The roar of the broom is not like the roar of a lion, but like a string of roars in the throat.
Ocelot cats eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if possible.
Scientists think that South American wild cats trace and find prey by sniffing, breathing every place where prey stood.
They can see very clearly in the dark with their ability to see at night and move skillfully, no one knows. Wildcats prey on prey by venturing into the surrounding space, then sweating to catch prey.
When a small group of living organisms (small numbers) detach themselves from the main population (such as when they move across a mountain or river, or to an island far from where they originated so that they are unlikely to return), this group of organisms often perceives that they are in a different environment than before.

The original population remained unchanged, and they needed the same adaptation.
As the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they begin to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.

The cost of the war of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial government to pay for most of the expenses and floating bond interest rates in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super-profits earned from the long exploitation of the Filipino people became the main source of income for American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar organization, one must understand the context that led to its birth.
The period in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the Middle Ages, a period in European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (years 1000-1300 AD)
Middle Ages occurs after the Middle Ages and before the Late Ages, according to convention ending around 1500.
Technical decision-making is a concept that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological advancement or technological coercion to the narrow sense that human destiny is controlled by an underlying logical system linked to scientific laws and expressions in engineering.
Most interpretations of technological decision-making have two general ideas: technological development itself takes a separate path, is not influenced by culture and politics, and technology has the opposite "influence" on existing societies, not conditional societies.

However, the national road network is not economically viable for some cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The over-ownership of cars has also led to an increase in traffic accidents, leading to new medical inventions to repair injuries to the body.
Romanticism has a major influence on cultural decision-making, drawing on authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the geography shaped individuals and over time the customs and cultures associated with that area developed and these combined with social status were still better than the dictatorial laws imposed.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.

Substantive agriculture is a form of agriculture that is carried out solely to meet the food needs of farmers and their families.
Self-supply agriculture is a simple system, usually only organic fertilisation, using stored seeds of endemic plant varieties combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been self-sufficient farmers, which is still the case in many developing countries.

Cultural diversity may vary by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The factors that define the culture of different regions can be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography or a combination of these factors.
Members of a cultural group often express relationships through the use of characteristic and symbolic styles such as fashion, eating habits, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite some unfortunate cases of child neglect, unhappiness, or intentional abuse, lack of social contact from the foster child as an adult.
Some wild children have been held captive (usually by their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child is due to the parents' refusal to accept the child who is mentally or physically impaired.

When raised entirely by non-human animals, wild children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of animals that have cared for them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more exciting, the Scaffolding education method goes beyond that.

The Internet combines elements of both community and personal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet have led to many new aspects of how to use and approach content.
For example, learning and socialisation are proposed as important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Self-engagement and continuous relevance are also seen as new driving forces according to Eighmey and McCord (1998) as they conduct a survey of your read responses to electronic websites.
The use of video cameras has led to important discoveries in interpreting transient expressions, which are movements that occur only in a few milliseconds of the face.

Oliver Sacks in his article "The President's Speech" showed how people who cannot understand a speech because of brain damage can accurately assess honesty.
He even suggested that these abilities in interpreting human behavior might also be present in other animals such as domesticated dogs.
20th century studies have shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: immersion and immersion.
The mutation adds new genetic variants and selectivity removes it from the expression variant group.

The fastest plant sources would probably be the protein in the leaves and plants they plant, but they're hard for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
Conversely, animal food (feathers, termites, eggs) is not only easily digested, but also provides an abundant supply of protein containing all the essential amino acids.

By 17 September 1939, the Polish line of defence was broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridge.

Using ships to transport cargo is the most efficient way at present to transport large quantities of people and goods by sea.
Traditional task of the navy is to ensure the maintenance of the nation's ability to transport people and goods, while also intervening in the movement of people and goods of the enemy.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The United States attempted to transport supplies and troops along the Atlantic to help Britain.
While the German Navy also used U-boats to try to block this flow of transport.
If the Allies failed, it was possible that Germany had conquered Britain after having defeated the rest of Europe.
Goat breed was first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping these animals for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
House goats were often raised as herds of swords wandering on hills or other pasture areas, mostly led by children or adolescents, similar to sheep.
The railway was built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the carriageways consist only of parallel wooden planks, they allow horses to pull at a faster speed and load larger quantities than on rough roads.

"The wooden wheels were eventually replaced by the iron wheel. In 1767 the first full-iron railway was launched".
The first known form of transportation was walking, humans began walking two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (i.e. straight man).
Their ancestor, the Australopithecus, was not straight.
The features of the two-legged species were found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs from seven million years ago.

After being passed by Congress on July 4, the manuscript signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
Of the 150 to 200 prints that were made overnight, today it is known as Dunlap Print.
The first reading of this document was by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, he read to his army in New York on July 9, a copy was sent to London on August 10.
Dunlap 25 is thought to be the oldest surviving photograph of this document.

bọ (bọ) is the term used by entomologists to designate this group of insects.
The term derives from ancient familiarity with bed bugs, an insect species that is highly adaptable to parasites on humans.
Both bloodsuckers and bed bugs are late-departure species, adapting to live in the nest or on the host.
Across the United States, there are currently about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making multiple sclerosis the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and visual nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.

Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts and especially the Latin Bible.
Acceptance is Aristotle's view of all matters related to science, including psychology.
As the understanding of Greece declined, the West found itself cut off from the origins of Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the rhythms observed in psychology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of the innate cycle and the reproduction of these rhythms through biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythm, not just responses to external cyclic signals, has been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clock is self-perpetuating oscillator and will continue to cycle freely even without external impact.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the convincing evidence that DNA is a kind of genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used plant organisms, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to mark DNA strands inside plant organisms with a radioactive phosphorus compound or plant proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Genetic mutation can cause many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genome segment, and whether the affected cell belongs to the type of germ cell.
Only mutations in bacterial stem cells can be passed on to the offspring, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.

Why do traffic systems make complaints, why do they make mistakes so often?Are traffic engineers not qualified?Or is there any more basic reason going on?
Traffic Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and the means between two points as well as how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it's very difficult to study traffic because you can't predict a hundred percent of the driver's behavior.
Fortunately drivers tend to behave within the appropriate range; therefore traffic flows tend to be logically consistent and can be mathematically expressed.
To better simulate traffic flow, a relationship between three main characteristics has been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design and operate road infrastructure.
