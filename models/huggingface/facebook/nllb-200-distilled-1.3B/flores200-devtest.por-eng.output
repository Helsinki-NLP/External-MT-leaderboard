This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is now well accepted, but it also offers details not so often found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper plumage of this animal was brown and the lower part was light or carotenoid.
The discovery also provides clues about the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers, known as racks, do not have a well-developed stem but do have other features, such as barbs and barbels.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for display or temperature regulation. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen has the plumage of an adult, not a calf.
The researchers suggested that although the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the sample revealed an adult plumage, not a plumage.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in the galaxy's environment in a kind of halo and is composed of several tiny particles.
Television reports report the white smoke coming out of the plant.

Infrared images show that the variations in temperature from night to day indicate that they are probably caves.
They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and hotter at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caverns on planet Earth, which usually maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and deposit a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures in a rather strict way.
Since 1988, the polling stations must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of the duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the process. During the night, votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court ever since, charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be compromised because her image has been widely released.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the justice system in Scotland acts differently, and courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists seem to be going in a dangerous direction when they publish photos, videos, etc., of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of the proceedings, has told reporters that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will address the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other issues covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control test were under close supervision by forest engineers while the test was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited in accordance with the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Park Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunt operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Yesterday, Martelly promised a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the CEP's early resignation as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the general anti-regime protests which began in October.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with overheating problems were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had reported 34 more overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 local time, which is Friday at 9:19 GMT.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said there were no reported damage in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers then took the place of an old lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Although he was working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would speed up the fetal lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes", flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen, my first businesswoman, Luna passed away on a night with two moons, something exceptional, just like her.
Dustin Goldust Runnels said, "Luna was as crazy as I was... or maybe even more... I loved her and I'll miss her... if she's in a better place".
Among the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal election, the percentage of those opposed to Australia's move to become a republic has grown 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 national election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, wishing Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the survey's extremes, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100 and 200 metre freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain, since these are prohibited at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of the date of January 25.
Several people tested the discovery using different types of hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were a source of water distribution to the earth along with organic matter that could develop proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his administration earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "politics and nonsense"
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would let aircraft fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no extra transport and no surface trains will stop at Wembley, parking and public transport links will not be available.
The problem of lack of transport increased the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors, without the presence of the fan.
On Thursday, the journal Science published a study reporting the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, due to the breeding between a Darwin's endemic finch, Geospiza forte, and the migratory finch cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape, even rolled into small shapes.
It can be stretched to form a fine thread, twisted and braided, hammered or rolled into sheets.
Because it was so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
You can make a marker using purple cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders and, with clean hands, shape them into a ball.
The moisture in your hands reacts with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a drain toilet in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remaining parts of sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also used, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet (30 m) high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing the wheel has done for us is it's given us a much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the car, and various other forms of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized cats, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat smaller, much larger animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche, a special function that each cat performs that prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called packs.
The flocks consist of one to three adult males from the same family, along with up to 30 females and young.
Women are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lions, leopards and otters. These four felines are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a phrase of shouted and roared words.
They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the jaguar hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that jaguatiri follow and find their prey by smell, sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and can also move stealthily. Jaguars hunt their prey by blending in with the environment around them and then attack their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or go to an island from which it is not possible to return easily), they often find themselves in an environment different from that in which they lived before.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics from what it already has and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, they breathe out)
Plants use the sun as their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes with plants and we make our clothes with plants. Most of the food we eat is plant. Without plants, animals couldn't survive.
Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of his era, so the only thing he feared were other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, showing that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had a forked tongue, his diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that got into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex would not be a match for it.
Although most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans still had their quota of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of rodent called the arganas
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to hold banquets together where they lay on their side while they made their meals.
The diet in ancient Rome did not include foods originating in the Americas and Asia for Europe, as it did in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which they considered the home of their respective god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to satisfy the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramids in the shape of towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the home was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were just open counters facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland had its sparse colonization, and in the Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and on his way west, he found Greenland and named it that way.
But regardless of their discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie The Legend of Lost Treasure, you might find that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Thus, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The landings and subsequent battles on D-Day liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
Within just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large, significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also, in some way, defines the size of society.
The culture of civilization depends on the transmission of knowledge through different generations, a lasting cultural reach and a just dissemination.
Smaller cultures often die without leaving adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government  with Congress its only component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, and because of the absence of a national executive or judicial branch, it relied on the generally uncooperative state authorities to enforce all its laws.
Moreover, there was no authority to repeal tax and tariff laws between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent among all states before they could be amended, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
The Italy national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has some 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical position, as an "archipel"
Taiwan's founding dates back to the 15th century, when Europeans sailing through the region named the place Formosa Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opened a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in Aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the boundaries of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was recovered, and this recovery continues to this day.
For example, the most common form of still image photography on the planet is 35 mm, which was the most common film size in circulation at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its proportion has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually confusingly 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The screen ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the smallest ratio between integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this ratio.
The often abused and often demoralized law of thirds is a fairly simple guideline that provides a dynamic while maintaining relative order in a figure.
According to him, the intersection of the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European states despite differences in language and customs.
Everyone was affected by his influence, from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central leadership of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital supplies of military and civilian personnel, although this blockade has violated generally accepted international regulations and been laid down in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, bringing danger even to neutral-flag vessels.
Germany, since there was a limited response to this tactic, expected an attack similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations desired to prevent such a situation from occurring again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States without a penny, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the head of his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different eras; each stage of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, post-Revolution, vacancies were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the military, since instead of ranks being based on social class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hira'" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's religious leanings.
Resting atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists.
You can't see anything but the clear blue sky above and the mountains around.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor dead Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead has several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The 'upward-pointing arc' mark has its similar appearance to a V, and the 'downward-pointing arc' mark has its similar appearance to a clamp or a square without the bottom.
Top means you should start at the tip and push the bow; bottom means you should start at the heel (which is where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
Generally, an upward arc produces a softer sound, while a downward arc produces a stronger, more assertive sound.
You can write your own notes, but don't forget that printed bow notes exist for a musical reason, so these must be respected.
On 6 October 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, eleven, and Louis Charles, four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris, leaving Versailles, by a crowd of women from the markets.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a protester waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino population itself.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on floating rate bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time when such events occurred is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period in European history between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Low Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of ideas in practice, from the technological supply or technological imperative to a strict notion that human fate is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share 2 general ideas: first, it is that technological development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; second, it is the idea that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the automobile necessarily results in the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare system to heal injured bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Geography, in the context of Romanticism, caused citizens to be shaped and that, over time, the customs and culture linked to that geography emerged, which, being in harmony with the place of society, became better than the laws eventually binding.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that Crusade participants returned with gifts such as silks and spices, which were worth more than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic language reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and also in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the eastern region.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances for the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to turn to the few regrettable cases of children who were, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
Some of these children have been confined by people (usually by their parents themselves); in some cases, the abandonment of this child has resulted in the rejection of the child by the parents because of his severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are rebellious may have suffered serious trauma or abuse in childhood before being abandoned or run away from home.
Others are supposed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived on their own in the jungle.
When completely raised by animals, the feral child displays behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular pet, such as its fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help for students who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual or face-to-face, in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, just like that little talking clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software to question, alert and explain procedures that can be challenging for the learner to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a myriad of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that doesn't nurture, care for and educate, but it does.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our adoption platform has a duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education and guaranteed medical care.
Adoption is supposed to meet all the needs that were missing in the home they were taken from.
The Internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and gratifications.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuous relationships were also identified as new motivational characteristics by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person can detect if another person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities of interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: secret and manifest.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the cluster of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two bases with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans, consuming the available plant resources, to meet its amino acid requirements.
Furthermore, failure to act on it leads to serious consequences - severe depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant-based resources would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but they're hard for us primates to digest unless they're cooked.
However, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
Given all this, it would not be surprising if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" much as modern savannah chimpanzees do.
Sleep interruption is a process of deliberately waking during the normal period of sleep and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a half-quiet alarm clock to bring him to consciousness without waking him up.
If you find yourself resetting your watch while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off
Other biorhythm-based possibilities include drinking plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleeping, as it forces the person to get up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace correlates in an opposite way to his level of physical and spiritual tension.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were expanded upon by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, kundalini energy (enlightening energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes and cultures led to the disintegration of the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years and, in fact, there would be leadership of replacement troops on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed and the only way out was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Union Red Army soldiers created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient means of moving people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that its country maintains the ability to move people and goods while at the same time interfering with its enemies' ability to move their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the Battle of the North Atlantic in World War II, when the Americans were trying to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy organization, using mostly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have the ability to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to facilitate access to milk, fur, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pasture areas, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the better-known shepherd.
Wagonways were built in England from the 16th century onwards.
Although the carriages consisted only of parallel wooden planks, this allowed horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads on slightly more bumpy roads.
Sleeping rails were implemented early on to keep the rails in place, but gradually it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal cover on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means "upright man").
Its predecessor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal adaptations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating to between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, however, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't want to have a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problem and stop it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of the human race, and problems have become greater because of man's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle.
After adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the Speaker of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to a printer by John Dunlap.
During the night, around 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap attacks".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap attacks that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scaled legs and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs, like a T-rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and those numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The strongest indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to that particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are structured to stick to humans.
Both beetles and bedbugs are nest-dwelling, adapted to live in their hosts' nests or shelters.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in youth and adults
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or that of their child.
Such couples are allowed to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that guides scientific research.
It's not, in fact, just experimentation; an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's scientific thoughts were accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself distancing itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Various rhythms observed in physiology and behavior usually depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are absolutely no responses to periodic external stimuli, have been found for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a continuous cycle period even without environmental interference.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main indicators that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments that tagged either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, taking pictures, watching birds, visiting parks and studying the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of small towns in the countryside to work in other towns, and they run into other people who work in the very small towns they came from.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected and supporting a transport system based on private cars.
Science now points out that this carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere from the stable state that had allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the analysis of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two different points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships assist in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings back are dragonflies and the ephemeral.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed otherwise - that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds sensible, because planet Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest river and the second longest on Earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching almost six miles [10 km] in width.
A total of 20 percent of the water that goes from the rivers of the planet to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
Ancient New Kingdom Egyptians marveled at the buildings of their predecessors, which were by then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the common language used by most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper because they can all be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is simply a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so staggeringly small that it would be possible for trillions of them to fit in the last period of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it was first released.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods appeared, the pencil was relegated to a less important paper and use.
Today, people text on computer screens and do not need to get close to a pointer.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to build a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like riding a heavy cart up a hill, and the splitting of the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate with little or no incentive.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side.
The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There could be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what is in certain people that makes them want what they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former coworkers. One side of the spectrum tries to maintain itself as "part of the guys' (or girls') group".
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, making performance reviews, delegating and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels like he should change everything the team has done and do his own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior often results in conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have to maintain the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, however, there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members usually act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may be in varying time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member must report.
Why would an organization want to go through the difficult process of establishing organizational learning? One of the practical goals of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity come through.
As a result, the process of an organization working as a team to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's need.
Even before an organization can be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels in their performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, so it narrows the scope of research and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain and behavioral pathology underpins scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, addressing behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer questions and diagnoses, as well as writing, voice and speech recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it is integrated into various home computer and video game software applications.
Study visits are very important for any school classroom. Often, teachers would love to take their students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field lessons, where students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a field trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at Bennet School in North Carolina develop a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is redesigned, but the older versions are kept online to serve as a souvenir book.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing, since students often start their contact with blogs using poor grammar and spelling, so the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to work on improving his writing and avoiding criticism.
In addition, having a blog "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them".
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; by actively interacting with Internet content, students can place themselves in the context of the writings of others as well as set their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and boasts a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is further south; the north has the unspoilt natural beauty of Muskoka and more.
Because of all this and more, Ontario stands out as what outsiders consider the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are also quite sparsely populated and some are virtually uninhabited in nature.
For a population comparison question that surprises many people, there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, a short distance off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent unto itself, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach hotels.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, which gained much popularity in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all travelers state that they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to acts that they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men. Do not be afraid to be firm (whether because of cultural differences or not, that does not mean that everything is fine!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Meridines as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by the Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco as a whole.
Near the historic part of Medina it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a lot of trinkets, all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried much of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be studied to understand the state of the ongoing battle in the province of Nord-Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motor taxi) to tour Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a quick tour.
"Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor to refer to distant and exotic lands, given their relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city despite its reputation for being a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was placed on the list of World Heritage in Danger because of the danger of desert sands.
It was a major stop during Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World program, broadcast on PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country because it has a more Arab than African touch.
Kruger National Park is in northeastern South Africa, along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River on the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting different animal species.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
There are fees for entrance and conservation of the park, as with all national parks in South Africa.
It can also be very useful to acquire a Wild Card, which allows you to enter several parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider their main attraction.
The parade of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a scintillating bar chart that is made visible by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the edge of Kowloon on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists chose to live in, and so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a great place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove range in the world, extending for 80 km (50 mi) inland towards Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they have some of the last great jungles that have ever covered the remaining Gangetic surface.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer sighted in the area.
There are several bus departure times from the Inter-District Bus Station (across the river) during the day, but most, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since intercity buses are almost always full, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coastal minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a truss bridge that crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and São Jorge do Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two runways of 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] Construction was completed in August 2011 and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be operational in September 2017, the expected date for completion of customs inspections in Brazil.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicurus and the Paiaguás, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", emerged from the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the three-century-long colonial period.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in retaining many of its characteristics and indigenous identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To stay up-to-date on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands that can change money is the one in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
Pound sterling is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and credit cards and US dollars are accepted at Stanley.
In remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currencies may be accepted. Please check with the owners in advance to find out which payment method they accept.
It is virtually impossible to change Falklands currency outside the islands, so change the money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there, while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezer, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rain" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains basically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or disturbed.
Following park officials' instructions, stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, moose, and bears, as well as all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they didn't keep a proper distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, but avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a famous naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk except one British cruiser, nearly 200 German and American lives lost.
During the Mau-organized independence struggle, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland being between two coves.
The beaches on the north shore (in the North Harbour district) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shadows from the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the central Auckland region.
These are sometimes family beaches crowded with a wide variety of shops around the coast.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It is not a refined beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are plenty of French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines may come down better.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're nervous.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black coffee is "espresso", the cappuccino comes filled with cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian-standard, the natural juices are expensive, but they're great.
Many trips to the reef are made year-round, and injuries from any of these causes, which occur on the reef, are rare.
Keep heeding the authorities' reminders, obeying all signs, and paying close attention to safety alerts.
The cuckoofish occurs near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, but their main habitat is the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents usually do business with specific hotels, although it is likely that other types of accommodation, such as camping parks, can be booked by a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even package combinations with flights and hotels.
They can also guarantee your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have any changes or requests, they should first be sent to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on site, and most of them consider this a fundamental part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get there early so you can camp near the music.
Remember that even after the music closes on the main stages, some sections of the festival may continue to play late.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice generates a terrible noise for the most sensitive.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include sightseeing in the city.
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offers to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them in place.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of maintaining sobriety.
Whenever driving in high latitudes or on roads over mountains, one should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, friction is low, and you cannot drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, it is possible to fall enough snow to get you stuck in a very short time.
Visibility may also be reduced by falling or windy snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted year-round.
Safari is probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the darling of many visitors.
The term "safari", in its colloquial usage, refers to land trips to observe the impressive African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and basic equipment allows for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
Also known as a "wildlife walk", "walking safari", or "pasture", a walking safari is equivalent to walking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be hosted at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but in late March most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have iron and board for lending clothes, even if there is no iron in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not like wearing old socks, you can try using a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to let the tissue get too hot (which can make it shrink or, in more severe cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more efficient against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, many minutes are needed.
The quality of the filters varies, and if you are in doubt, you may want to consider buying gallons of water from a reliable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are unfamiliar to them in the regions from which they came.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, usually do not qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the chance to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through isolated backcountry areas.
If you are not used to driving on inland roads, use common sense. Steep slopes, narrow lanes, and steep curves are common.
The speed limits advertised are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 55-65 km/h - and strict compliance with them is even more important than the reverse.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as, say, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are very good, and in Bavaria they are quite capricious and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit desserts are a regular feature, with apples roasted in the desserts year-round, and cherries and plums making an appearance during the summer.
Many German bakery goods also have almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The famous cakes usually go well with a very strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but tasty sweets, try what, depending on the region, may be called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a range that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But when used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of dishes simply seasoned, the predominant spices of Javanese preference being peanuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
To support a rider's feet, stirrups are used, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but may present safety problems, as the rider's feet may become caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged away if the animal eventually escapes.
First, a large proportion of riders wear riding boots with a high heel and a smooth sole, which is quite narrow.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
As Chile's premier climbing destination, the Cochamó Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The meetings include thrilling views of the peaks, and climbers from all over the world are continually laying out new routes among their endless potential walls.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skating on snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important activity in travel for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums", who plan entire vacations just to ski in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old -- cave paintings depicting skiers, dating back to 5000 B.C.
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century at least, and in the year 1861, the first recreational ski team was opened by Norwegian citizens in Australia.
Skiing: activity also known as backcountry skiing, hiking or ski mountaineering.
It is related to, but generally does not involve, alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat longer distances than on foot  but only very rarely will you achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, functions as a country in this respect.
If you stay in that area, you can cross the border without going through passport controls again.
Similarly, by holding a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that specifies which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define that items over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important means of livelihood among the Sami, and the culture around trade is important for many other classes of professionals as well.
As much as it is a tradition, not all Sami people have participated in large-scale reindeer breeding, but they have lived off fishing, hunting and the like, having reindeer as mainly draught animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.

When planning a visit to a country that is considered a war zone, one must first receive professional training.
An Internet search for 'Hostile Environment Course' will usually give you the address of a company in the area.
A course will usually cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and involves dramatization, several first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on jungle survival are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Travellers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they are carrying valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with undefined gender (X), or updated documents to find a desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies widely.
Security checkpoint searches also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had gender reassignment surgery should not expect to pass through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Return currents are the reflux of water from waves on the beach back to the sea, usually at a reef or similar area.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid deep-water current can form there.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you've managed to get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than it usually would be.
Try to aim from somewhere where you can't be caught or, depending on your skills or if you've been spotted, wait for a rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs before culture shock (it takes less honeymoon time), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes have a special difficulty in readjusting to their native culture.
When you return home from living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your local culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People don't realize that patience and understanding are also essential for travelers who are returning home.
In the children's area, one of the most interesting things is the pyramid's light and sound show.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and also in the silence before the show starts.

The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are lit.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula.
The others are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360-kilometer Ellsworth Mountain Range, cut by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 15,050 feet at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a cell phone, since to make a call you need to be outdoors with a view of the satellite.
The service is often used for transportation, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone operator can provide more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who intend to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among high school dropouts, allowing them to take a year off before college without compromising their education.

There will usually be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programmes.
For boaters, Finland is a great destination.In the lakes and coastal archipelagos, the Land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.

Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is combined by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but a rather characteristic form (for example, in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for two full days and return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only embark on sea excursions, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, on the flyers. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if those people have never flown before or have never experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes of other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown or not being in control.
Freight forwarders are well paid to deliver things quickly, and often time is very important in sending commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, depending on the route, it could take days to get to the landing and clear customs.
The only way to get through faster was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a large amount of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, it is not even worth looking for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know full well that there is a small group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The language of the country is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.

Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not damage the place by staining or cracking the buildings with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because this is the language that has been established by law as the official language.

Regular announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.

The rough exterior of the Parisians will quickly disappear, if you show some basic courtesies
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, mostly with beech, fir, and pine trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a remarkable diversity of plant communities, due to varied microclimates, different soils and different altitude levels.

The Persian language has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
So reading this grammar book will help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to understand sentences better.

Pre-modern observatories are mostly outdated today and remain in museums or schools.
Since light pollution in its heyday was not a problem, they are often found in cities or university campuses, which are easier to reach than more recently built ones.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas that have favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the favorite flower.

Most traditional churches usually hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend. Congregations often break the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, for the sky gets dark at about the right time.
