Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the UK between 1 January and 15 March 2020
Cumulative coronavirus infection (COVID-19) incidence has similar trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK, confirming that despite different stages of development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to increase their preparedness for the influx of COVID-19 patients who will require treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the infection was caused by a new type of coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to the data available to date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 develop the disease in a mild form, i.e. as a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most patients recovering.
Approximately 14% of COVID-19 cases develop into more severe forms requiring hospitalization, and the remaining 6% develop into critical forms requiring intensive therapy.
The mortality rate of COVID-19 hospitalized patients is approximately 4%.
This study analyses the trends in cumulative COVID-19 cases in each European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) country and in the UK and compares them with trends in China's Hubei province.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with data for Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and now in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing at the same pace as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic of COVID-19.
In the March 5, 2020, issue of Eurosurveillance, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met WHO's criteria for diagnosis.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported in France on 24 January 2020  all three cases were returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 infections have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with 39,768 infections and 1,727 deaths recorded from 31 December 2019 to this date, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 deaths, occurred in Italy alone.
Determining the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates the number of COVID-19 cases in each country of the world daily at 8:00 a.m. from official sources such as the health ministries of those countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with data from Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, the 14 day cut-off cumulative COVID-19 incidence was calculated taking into account the normal course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 a.m. on 15 March 2020, compared to data for Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trends in the development of the cut-off cumulative COVID-19 disease over the 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK as a whole were consistent with the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
Cumulative COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole started to rise on or around 21 February, and a sharp jump in this indicator occurred on 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but similar trends in the cumulative increase in COVID-19 were also observed in all other EU/EEA countries and in the UK (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the same figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded as of 8:00 a.m. on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy just about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results indicate a rapid increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in cumulative COVID-19 cases suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the different stages in different countries, the differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for case recognition and different rules for selecting patients for COVID-19 testing, including "in-depth" testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions were already at peak capacity.
Currently, data on admissions of COVID-19 patients to hospitals and/or intensive care units in the EU/EEA are available only for 6 % and 1 % of cases respectively (data not presented).
However, such data should be collected systematically to supplement current observations on the number of cases and deaths.
According to a study conducted in 2010-2011 there is a significant disparity in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the outcomes of the COVID-19 Express Risk Assessment presents modelling scenarios for the load on health systems with estimated data on hospitalization of COVID-19 infected in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, when the risk of shortage of available ICU beds exceeds 90%.
As cases are currently grouped by EU/EEA and UK regions, and hospitals and ICUs usually serve a specific territorial population, it is recommended that information on cases and ICU beds be provided, where possible, in units of level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units must be prepared for the scenario of long-term non-relieving SARS-CoV-2 contact infection and the growing number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, which can be seen, for example, in affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ECDC Express Risk Assessment Report, a rapid, preventive and integrated approach to containment of SARS-COV-2 is critical, with the subsequent transition from containment to mitigation, as decision-makers and hospitals may simply not have enough time to consider, adopt and adapt their response if such measures are not taken early.
The report also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time in which they can step up their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks, health systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients requiring intensive care.
The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus infection (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been a tragedy for humanity: more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries, and the number of infected has exceeded 80,000.
Like the homologous SARS-CoV virus that caused thousands of people to develop severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than younger people, and men more often than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the new disease, this article offers a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will look at the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of this disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope this review will help us understand and eradicate this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), which fell on January 25, 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and for many weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of the new viral infection.
Given the high degree of similarity to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the virus SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease  coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread throughout the country, and then to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified, more than 40,000 patients have recovered, and more than 3,000 patients have died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the number one enemy of society and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 publications have appeared on COVID-19, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarise the results of research in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus-caused diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, which had its outbreak in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts known at the moment on disease prevention and prognosis, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronavirus has traditionally been a pathogen that is not fatal to humans and is responsible for about 15% of all respiratory illnesses.
However, we've had two highly pathogenic human coronavirus in this century, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused outbreaks originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with alarming rates of disease severity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the first report of clusters of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin was received by the National Health Commission of the PRC from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, it became known that medical workers had been infected, suggesting the possibility of human-to-human transmission.
On January 23, Wuhan was quarantined, and public transport stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease found that 21 of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with a seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point of infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to approximately 50 other countries worldwide (Figure 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final extent and extent of the outbreak's danger has yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, the following updated picture of the epidemic development was presented (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA) based on the results of a multi-centre clinical study involving 8 866 patients, including 4 021 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection.
SARS-CoV-2 infection was found to be prevalent in all age groups, but mostly in people aged 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, very few were younger than 20, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 has spread in clusters mainly in Hubei Province and nearby regions.
On average, 5 (29) days passed from the time of COVID-19 symptoms to diagnosis.
The incubation period was an average of 4.8 (3.07.2) days.
From the time the symptoms appeared to the time of death, an average of 9.5 (4.813) days passed.
The basic reproduction index (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.514.05), and the corrected R0 was 2.234.82.
By 23 January 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infected, coinciding with the large-scale transportation on the eve of the Chinese New Year celebrations.
Mortality among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95 % CI: 1.101.86 %), and corrected mortality among patients was  3.06 % (95 % CI: 2.024.59 %).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were: gender (male), age (≥60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronavirus are a subfamily of large shell viruses that contain a single strand of meaningful RNA.
They can be divided into four types, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to infect humans.
In case of infection with SARS-type and MERS-type coronaviruses, the shell-like spider-like growths (S) glycoprotein binds to the cell receptors of angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidaze-4 (DPP4) respectively, after which membrane synthesis occurs.
In the cytoplasm, the genome of the viral RNA is released; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, along with the membrane glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, generates virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the cell membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence appeared on 10 January 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus, whose genome is 99.98 percent identical to 10 sequential samples collected at the first outbreak site, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
With the help of illuminated electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-thin slices of the human respiratory epithelium.
It has been established that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 enzyme more weakly than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients to have a lesser degree of severity than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein, encoded orf3b, and a secreted protein, encoded orf8.
The orf3b protein of SARS-CoV-2 may play some role in terms of virus pathogenicity and suppress IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, a team led by Zhou presented reports on cryoprecipitation of the structure of the human ACE2 enzyme with a resolution of 2.9 Å in combination with the B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that this complex, which included both open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S-proteins, which is evidence for coronavirus recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target in drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate owner
The source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is known to have been bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans through the tibet and camels respectively.
By phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was determined that the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2 were bats, as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely bat coronaviruses SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unclear which species became the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier and infect humans; the route of transmission is also yet to be determined.
Ji and his colleagues suggested that the virus was transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which then re-combined homologously in the S protein.
In their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pangolins  long-eared mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine  are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on the 99 percent genetic similarity between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still very large, so it is considered that the final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 4050 % humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet light and to heating to 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75 percent ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxide, chloroforms, and other fatty solvents can effectively block the activity of the virus, but not chlorhexidine.
The human population as a whole does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, there are no data on detailed immunoassay studies of SARS-CoV-2.
So we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).4.
Typically, the virus that enters the host body is first recognized by the innate immune system via image-recognition receptors (IRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate phagocytosis of macrophages against viral antigens.
However, the N-protein allows SARS-CoV to avoid an immune reaction.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is activated to fight the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the body's defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-infected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect the cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T-cell function, causing their programmed death.
Humoral immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies secreted from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system results in a local buildup of large amounts of free radicals, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case scenario, lead to multi-organ failure and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestations, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have immune system disorders.
According to the results of the study of data on the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mostly 37 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period lasted an average of 3 days, with a spread of 0 to 24 days.
A later study, based on the demographics of 8,866 cases, described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.07.2) days.
It is important for health authorities to adjust the timing of quarantine measures to take into account the most accurate calculations of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected who have the disease without symptoms.
A 14-day quarantine has become common practice for people who have had contact with the virus or are infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The primary and most frequent symptom of COVID-19 is often a high fever, which may be the only symptom or be accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nausea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/ or hypoxia within a week of onset.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory illness, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high fever and/or symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be screened for the virus in order to diagnose early, even if there are no pathologies on the chest x-rays.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 revealed the following indicators of symptom prevalence: 98%  high fever, 76%  dry cough, 55%  shortness of breath and 3%  diarrhea; 8% of patients required artificial ventilation of the lungs.
Similar results were obtained in two recent studies of family-acquired infections and transmission from asymptomatic infected individuals.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of MERS-CoV patients, whose main symptoms were also high fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80 percent of them required artificial ventilation of the lungs, which is much higher than among COVID-19 patients, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than from COVID-19.
MERS patients also had diarrhea (26%) and sore throats (21%)
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high fever (99100 %), dry cough (2975 %), shortness of breath (4042 %), diarrhea (2025 %) and sore throat (1325 %), and artificial ventilation of the lungs is required by 1420 % of patients.
As of 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
In comparison, the death rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10 % of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
In an earlier study, the baseline reproduction index (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 at a 95% confidence interval (CI) within 5.717.23, whereas the R0 for SARS-CoV was only in the range of 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV by manifestation of symptoms, mortality and R0 is given in Table 1.1.
The above indicators indicate a higher capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in case of infection with the new virus is lower compared to the latter two.
Thus, containing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Cluster manifestations often occur when the infection occurs within a single family or a group of people who are gathered together for some reason or who are on a transport such as a cruise ship.
Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there, or were in contact with infected or sick people within the last two weeks before the onset of illness.
However, reports suggest that people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and that cured patients, once discharged from the hospital, can become carriers again, which is a warning sign for extending the quarantine period.
Early in the disease, patients have normal or decreased numbers of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in the peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphocyte lesions with leukocyte levels < 4×109/L, including leukocyte levels < 1×109/L, as well as elevated levels of asparagine aminotransferase and virusesemia.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in their blood, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell deposition.
In patients with severe disease, the levels of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin, present in the blood were elevated, and the number of lymphocytes was constantly reduced.
Most COVID-19 patients have had pathologies characterized by unevenly dimmed discs on both sides of the chest or dimmed discs in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory illness (ARD).
In the development of OCD, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to significant gas exchange disruption.
Type I and II lung cell dysfunction lowers the surface-active connections and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
So the worst X-rays often coincide with the most severe cases.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated pneumocytes layering, hyaline membrane formation and intertissue lymphocytic infiltration, and multicellular syncytial cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease corresponded to the pathology of viral infection and MRSA and were similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The main criterion for diagnosing COVID-19 was the method of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase).
However, given the high level of false negatives that can accelerate the pace of the epidemic, from 13 February 2020 in China began to diagnose on the basis of clinical manifestations (no longer relying exclusively on PCR with reverse transcriptase).
The same thing happened with the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, it is critical and necessary to combine the data of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray results for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, a team led by Mr. Feng Zhang described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK method to detect SARS-CoV-2; this method allows detecting synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at a density of 20 × 1018 mol/l to 200 × 1018 mol/l (10100 copies per micrliter of the original sample) using indicator strips in less than an hour without the use of sophisticated equipment.
This new methodology, if it is successfully tested in clinical drugs, could significantly improve the sensitivity and ease of testing.
Due to the lack of experience in dealing with previously unknown coronavirus, doctors may generally only provide COVID-19 patients with supportive therapy, while attempting to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or proposed in the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
It was suggested that even the plasma of recovered patients be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks primarily the lungs, and may also affect other ACE2 expressing organs to a lesser extent, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of death for patients.
Thus, supporting respiratory function is critical to alleviating symptoms and saving lives, including general oxygen therapy, high-concentration oxygen administration, non-invasive artificial ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, which are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary circulation technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining water-salt balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are of paramount importance for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that the cytokine storm is a consequence of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune cells to release a large amount of free radicals, which are the main cause of RLS and polyorgan failure.
In the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in patients in severe condition, suppression of the immune system is of paramount importance.
For the treatment of cytokine storm, corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies that act as an inhibitor of interleukin-6, were used.
Other methods of treatment for cytokine storm based on suppression of immunity include modulation of the immune reaction directed at controlling T cells; blockade of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF cytokines; suppression of I-kinase; use of blinatumob, cytokine signal suppressors 4 and histone acetalase inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants to reduce the severity of inflammatory effects in the treatment of SARS viruses.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful in treating severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.
However, short courses of low- and medium-dose corticosteroids are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, there is no proven effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been shown to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdecivir is a newly developed antiviral drug, originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola virus and Marburg virus.
Later remdesivir also demonstrated the ability to suppress other single-chain RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this data, Gilead has provided this drug to China for paired studies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been proposed as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
Care should be taken to monitor the interaction of these medicines with other medicines prescribed to patients.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody production
Blood harvesting from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease, to treat other patients with the same disease, or to protect a healthy population has been used for a long time.
And in fact, the blood of recovered patients often contains relatively high amounts of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
Antibodies are in the immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual molecules of pathogens and target them to neutralize them.
Based on this assumption, plasma was extracted from blood samples from a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and then injected into 10 severely ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, their inflammation and viral load decreased, and their blood oxygen saturation increased.
However, to propose the widespread use of this method before the implementation of specific therapy, it requires a yet unproven and uncompiled explanation.
In addition, some disadvantages of plasma therapy should be carefully considered for therapeutic effect.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given its toxicity, is potentially life-threatening.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma is needed a lot to treat patients in critical condition.
It's not easy to engineer and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
So it's more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and determine the genetic code of the active antibodies or to screen for active antibodies against critical virus proteins.
So we can go straight to mass production of antibodies.
The Chinese have used traditional medicine for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease, based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, as it is difficult to isolate and test these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific therapy for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become one of the main alternative methods of treatment for patients with mild to moderate severity of symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest proportion of recoveries from COVID-19 were recorded in a number of Chinese provinces, where traditional Chinese medicine was used to treat 87%, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, where traditional Chinese medicine was used to treat only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest proportion of recoveries (13%).
However, this is a fairly rough comparison, as the assessment must take into account a number of other influencing factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively with Western medicine and combined treatment with Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that patients who were treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine had significantly shorter recovery times, symptoms, and treatment in hospital than patients who were treated with Western methods alone.
Most surprisingly, the proportion of patients who started to have symptoms that worsened (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the group treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in the group treated by Western methods alone (7.4% versus 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine still requires more carefully controlled studies conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of particular interest to obtain a description of the mechanism of action and to explain aspects of the effectiveness of components used in the methods of traditional Chinese medicine, or their combinations.
Patients who suspect or have confirmed COVID-19 tend to have a strong fear of acute and even fatal disease, and people who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and extreme irritability.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, there have been reports of a number of psychiatric disorders, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal behavior.
Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, which are part of the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people's anxiety and guilt about the spread of infection, quarantine, and social stigma on their families and friends.
Psychological and psychiatric care should therefore be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected contacts and others who need it.
In psychological support, multi-disciplinary psychiatric care teams should be formed, clear information should be established with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the chain of transmission from infected animals and infected humans to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work was carried out to create S-protein-based vaccines, the purpose of which is to produce long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
In animal studies, live attenuated vaccines against SARS viruses have been developed.
However, before clinical trials begin, the efficacy of these potential natural vaccines in older patients, the pattern of lethal doses and the degree of protection against zoonotic virus infection must be determined.
Perhaps the reason is that SARS disappeared 17 years ago, and since then, no new cases have been reported.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS-related disease continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the preservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitat areas.
Vaccine strategies have been developed to combat MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for people without immunity is an urgent and critical task that requires a solution to curb the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long time (average 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic variation of coronavirus.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show the full picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with high rates of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
In this context, it is critical for health authorities to develop a disease prognostic model to prioritize their actions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on the clinical trial data presented at this time, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of disease in COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33)):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of SARS-related disease, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily affects patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who required intensive therapy were more likely to have the original disease and complications and were significantly older than those who did not require intensive therapy (average age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute myocardial damage and arrhythmias.
Cardiology was also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It's worth noting that age and disease origin are closely linked and can distort the results.
Laboratory abnormalities: The level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and is proposed to be considered as a potential prognostic factor for disease progression, response to therapy, and eventual recovery.
It was also suggested to consider the relationship between C-reactive protein levels, disease severity and prognosis for COVID-19.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagine aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatine kinase may also predict the outcome.
These enzymes are released in large quantities by various organs, especially the heart and liver, and they are released when tissue is damaged.
So they're traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: Chest X-ray data and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be considered along with other factors to predict outcomes and complications of COVID-19 treatment.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants widely used in infectious diseases as an adjunct therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
As corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, which caused lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if steroids are needed to treat COVID-19 patients, they should be administered in low doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen extreme stress, as they often have to endure long quarantine periods, deal with high levels of uncertainty, and watch their relatives and other patients die.
To relieve the stress of such patients and help them to return to a normal life, psychological counseling and long-term support are essential.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic in its features.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronavirus causing common colds, can successfully replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms at all in the early stages of infection.
For this reason, patients who are in the early stages of the disease or have not yet completed the incubation period may, in their normal lives, spread the virus on a large scale, making epidemiological control significantly more difficult.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to occur when patients were severely ill, whereas most cases did not occur in the early stages of infection.
So today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it's harder to control.
Currently, China is undergoing a major work-in-progress, with a general quarantine in Wuhan and neighboring cities, and a prolonged quarantine for almost the entire population, introduced to break the chain of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
While these measures are causing huge damage to the economy and other areas of the country's life, the number of new cases is decreasing, suggesting a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates are that the outbreak will end by March, and the phase of extinguishment will last 34 months.
However, some experts are less optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and his colleagues have calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Researchers from a team led by Ira Longini have developed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and have suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two-thirds of the world's population.
A team of Canadian experts reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in nasal and throat swabs taken from patients who had recovered and been discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus may become a cyclical illness similar to influenza.
However, the decline in new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that current strategies may have had an effect.
According to initial estimates, Ebola fever was expected to affect up to a million people and cause the death of half a million patients.
But through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
There is a possibility that, like SARS-CoV, the infectious capacity of SARS-CoV-2 may weaken and, over time, it may disappear or become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by high transmission rates through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which means it could also be transmitted by oral fecal route.
One recent study found that 41 percent of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously diagnosed diseases and 40 health care workers.
Therefore, serious precautions should be taken to protect the public, especially healthcare workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even strangers who come into contact with patients or those infected.
The first line of defense in reducing the risk of infection  is wearing face masks; both surgical masks and N95 respirators (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent micro-droplets of fluid from potentially infected individuals from spreading through the air and settling on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (series 1860s) can protect against inhaling 10 to 80 nm of virons, they only pass 5% of the virons; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both about 85 nm in magnitude.
Since particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks folded together, medical personnel in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series No. 1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers should wear a protective coat to further reduce the risk of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare workers should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type goggles.
All people in affected or potentially endangered areas are strongly advised to wash their hands more often with disinfectant detergents, stay indoors, and self-isolate, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is about one meter.
These measures are effective in reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was previously unknown to mankind, its high degree of similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have been a wake-up call for China, given the experience it gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was only after 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured the public by saying that the new virus has low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity when transmitted from person to person and that preventing and controlling the spread of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement has greatly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing for the Chinese New Year celebrations, and missed a critical time when the disease could be contained within Wuhan with minimal losses.
Chinese health authorities can learn from this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements as every word is taken into account by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more carefully to unusual information coming from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages of development rather than to reassure the public; and (4) conduct more frequent targeted and effective exercises to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and regular screening and improve the response system of society.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the previously unstudied severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type II (SARS-CoV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease had spread throughout China and, at the time of this writing, had spread to 50 countries.
Because the virus is very similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) coronavirus and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a feeling of SARS recurrence.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are significant in terms of containment of the epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality rates among older people are also higher than among young people.
The mortality rate from SARS is higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91 % compared to 1.44 %).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even when the disease is asymptomatic, whereas SARS patients usually only infect others in severe cases, so containing the spread of COVID-19 is more difficult than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and at a much larger scale than SARS-CoV.
Some COVID-19 patients may have negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests.
On the other hand, cured patients can test positive for the virus again.
All of this significantly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some key questions remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 percent homologue between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still cannot claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection originated from bats.
What animal became the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions one and two, we cannot reliably interrupt the transmission pathway, and the epidemiological situation could escalate at any moment.
Molecular modeling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter respiratory cells and provoke subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2 producing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot provide a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve in the process of human-to-human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it disappear like SARS, or will it recur periodically like the flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to answer these and many other questions.
But we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life, whatever the cost.
The zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.
Until 2003, two human coronavirus (HCoVs) were known to cause a mild illness such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our understanding of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in central China in late 2019 has again attracted attention to coronavirus and surprised us with the high transmissibility, but weaker pathogenicity of this virus compared to its relative SARS-CoV.
The human coronavirus is a zoonosis, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very helpful.
Most human coronaviruses originate from bats, for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoirs of some human coronaviruses are also known.
Identifying animal vectors directly affects the prevention of human disease.
Studying the interactions of animals that are carriers of coronavirus could also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present the available data on seven human coronavirus, focusing on their history of discovery, as well as their zoonotic origin and ways of interspecies transmission.
It's important to note that we're comparing and matching different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of the disease caused by the coronavirus, discovered in 2019 (COVID-19), is also considered.
It also notes the conditions necessary for successful carrier switching and the impact of virus evolution on the severity of the disease course.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of shell viruses with one positive-polar RNA strand.
These viruses, which have the largest genome among RNA-containing viruses, ranging from 26,000 to 32,000 nucleotides, are named for their shape, which resembles a crown when viewed under an electron microscope.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain non-segmented genomes with identical organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are translated into the polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab replicases.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, denoted nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading frames for structured proteins, including spike protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
Other lines of coronavirus also encode a number of linear accessory proteins.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four types (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-coronavirus), with betacoronavirus species including most human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that bats and rodents are the genetic source of most alpha and beta coronaviruses, while birds are the primary reservoir for gamma and delta coronaviruses.
For millennia, coronaviruses have continually overcome species barriers, and some of them have evolved into human-damaging pathogens.
There are seven known human coronaviruses.
These include human alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five betacoronavirus include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type two SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronavirus HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogenic, causing severe infectious diseases of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory disease (ARD) and exopulmonary symptoms.
The first strand of the human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample separated from the nasopharynx of patients who contracted the common cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has led to more detailed knowledge about the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses, which cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a commonly accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was generally considered harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were infected, and the overall mortality rate was about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak led to a long-term epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease sporadically spreading to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) discovered in 2019, which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current coronavirus infection epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which as of March 3, 2020 has claimed more than 3,120 lives, and the number of infected has exceeded 91,000.
The alarm has been sounded, and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses are zoonotic in origin, with their sources being bats, mice or domestic animals.
Numerous data sets support the evolutionary nature of all human coronavirus from bats, to which the viruses have adapted well and in which they do not show pathogenic properties, but demonstrate wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a serious challenge to China and the world from a medical, scientific, social and moral standpoint.
Studying the zoonosis mechanism of human coronavirus origin will help us understand their natural history, the driving forces behind their evolution, and the factors that limit interspecies transmission.
It may also indicate or speed up the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifying carrier for SARS-CoV-2, which is crucial to preventing future re-spread of the disease.
This review provides general information on the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronavirus.
In particular, we identify and consider the following common feature: the original viruses that gave rise to human coronaviruses are usually not pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new carrier.
We also analyze the evolutionary trend of human coronavirus, which is that increased transmissibility is often accompanied by weaker pathogenicity.
In this same context, the outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also being considered.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first isolated from a sample taken from the nasopharynx of cold-blooded patients, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in the last decade.
Table 1 provides a brief and visual history of human coronavirus detection in chronological order.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was obtained from respiratory samples taken from patients with infectious upper respiratory tract lesions in 1966; the virus later adapted to multiply in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general malaise and sore throat, while fever and cough were observed in 1020% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brains of mice-suckers.
The clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E infection, with symptoms that are indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are widespread in the world and are usually transmitted in winter in temperate latitudes.
The incubation period of these two viruses is usually less than a week, followed by about two weeks of illness.
According to the results of the study on volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients developed severe infections of the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the atypical pneumonia epidemic, was the first well-documented pandemic in human history caused by the human coronavirus, and was caused by the SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus identified.
The first case of SARS was detected in late 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread to many countries and continents.
Without taking into account the overactive vectors, it was calculated that each infected person could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period was 4 to 7 days, and the peak viral load was on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experienced muscle pain, headache, fever, general malaise and chills, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, coughing, and respiratory failure.
Common deviations from the norm in SARS are lymphopenia, liver abnormalities and elevated creatine kinase levels.
SARS patients also have diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and elevated macrophage levels.
Approximately 2030% of patients subsequently require intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In such severe cases, other organs besides the lower respiratory tract, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, may also be infected, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that can be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open-label biopsy of the lungs of a relative of the patient who had come to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a huge amount of effort has been put into the study of human coronaviruses.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
It was first found to affect mostly young children, the elderly, and patients with weakened immune systems and respiratory diseases.
For the disease caused by HCoV-NL63, symptoms such as cold sores, conjunctivitis, high fever, and bronchiolitis are typical.
Another independent study described the same virus being isolated from nasal swabs taken from an eight-month-old boy in the Netherlands who had pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but it's actually everywhere.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to be responsible for approximately 4.7% of widespread respiratory illnesses, with peak disease occurring in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to outpatient pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been associated with exacerbation of asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus, which causes mild respiratory illness, has been detected worldwide.
All four of these outpatient human coronavirus have adapted well to humans, and their mutation to cause highly pathogenic diseases is generally unlikely, although incidents have occurred and their causes are unknown, as in the rare case of the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63 which was reported to have caused a serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Usually, by acquiring the ability to transmit and retain themselves effectively in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure.
Most laboratory-confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but there have been cases of importation and transmission through episodic secondary contacts in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)  both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human-to-human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, there are more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4%), so MERS-CoV is considered one of the deadliest viruses known to man.
In the period from mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which is now being linked to infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been named coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
As of 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases in the world, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in China's Hubei Province is 4.2%, and outside of it  1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 like SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes severe respiratory infection characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a greater capacity to transmit than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
There have been cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating the ability of this virus to spread rapidly around the world.
Comparisons and comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with six other human coronaviruses reveal important similarities and differences.
First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have similar incubation periods and durations of disease.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most often observed in human coronavirus infections that cause outpatient infections, including nonspecific manifestations, mild symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower here.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, characteristic of both human coronaviruses that cause outpatient infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses that cause outpatient infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. infecting each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause out-of-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
We have yet to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause outpatient infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after human transmission.
All four human coronaviruses, which cause out-of-hospital infections with mild symptoms, have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it's possible that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be called the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
The human coronavirus that causes severe disease in humans, and the people that have human coronavirus that cause severe disease, just didn't survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in the human body to a sufficient extent to accumulate adaptive mutations that counter the limiting factors of the carrier.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to stop its transmission among humans through quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.
Four out-of-hospital coronavirus have been circulating for years, causing the common cold in people with healthy immune systems.
These viruses don't need a reservoir animal.
Highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs have not adapted well enough to humans, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.
They need to preserve and reproduce in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for opportunities to reach susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, and four other HCoVs.
It's very transmissible, like out-of-hospital HCoVs, at least for now.
But it's more pathogenic than out-of-hospital HCoVs, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoVs or MERS-CoVs.
It remains to be seen whether it will adapt fully to humans and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate host animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying and reservoir carriers of HCoVs.
An animal is an evolutionary carrier of HCoVs if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and nonpathogenic in that carrier.
Similarly, the reservoir carrier carries HCoVs continuously for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoVs were only introduced into an intermediate carrier just before or around the time it was introduced to humans, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate vector can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as a reinforcing vector, allowing the virus to replicate in a flash and then transmit it to humans, amplifying the scale of human infection.
HCoVs can carry a deadly infection if they cannot withstand transmission within an intermediate carrier.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to an intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemism.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes the natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero SARS patient had a history of contact with hunting-hunting animals (wildlife).
Further studies of seroprevalence showed that the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV in animal traders is higher compared to the general population.
Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and an enotate dog in live animal markets were the first confirmed carriers of similar and nearly identical SARS-CoV viruses.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that after the elimination of all the tibetans in the markets, no SARS cases were reported.
At the same time, it was reported that Himalayan civet living in the wild or on farms and not reaching the market, in most cases SARS-CoV was not detected, which allows to conclude that Himalayan civet could only serve as an intermediate reinforcing carrier, not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that since 80% of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out that many species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate reinforcing carriers.
They all seem to be dead-end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
Subsequent search for a natural animal-carrier SARS-CoV identified a bat-related CoV, which was named as the atypical bat-related coronavirus HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), and which is present in Chinese bat-borne bats.
These mice are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
These and other bat coronaviruses have 88% to 92% of the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats were carriers of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none of them, except one, which is designated WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The receptor for SARS-CoV is known to be human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
WIV1, derived from bat fecal samples, has been shown to use ACE2 from bats, tibetans and humans as a receptor for cell entry.
Interestingly, the serum of recovering SARS patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
WIV1 is the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats to date, sharing 95% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV, and bats are not the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis has assigned MERS-CoV to the same group as CoV-HKU4 in bats and CoV-HKU5 in bats.
Bat-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptidypeptidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate the viruses.
The sequences of RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase of the MERS-CoV virus are phylogenetically closer to those from bat betacoronavirus identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
The nucleotide sequence homology of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 in bats is only 87%.
So bats may not be the direct reservoir carrier of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that monozygotic camels are seropositive to the neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
A live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal swabs of one-eyed camels, further confirming camels' role as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV had minor symptoms, but massive virus secretion.
It is noteworthy that the infected camels not only secreted the virus through the respiratory tract, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus secretion in bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome have no history of contact with camels before symptoms occur and are believed to be human-to-human or transmission through unknown channels involving unidentified animal species that are carriers of MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide homology is 96.2% identical to the CoV RaTG13 of bats isolated from Asian horseshoe cats Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute to them a parental relationship.
So bats may not be the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2 unless in the future, almost identical bats coronavirus are found.
The immediate vectors of SARS-CoV-2 should be among wild species sold and killed at the Wuhan seafood wholesale market, which has been linked to many early cases of COVID-19, suggesting a likely case of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenome sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also have carried the parent betacoronavirus, a relative strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The sequence homology of these new coronavirus pangolin genomes is 85-92% identical to SARS-CoV-2.
But they're also closely related to RaTG13, with a nucleotide sequence identity of about 90%.
They cluster into two subline of differentiation of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains of RSD are more divergent, despite higher levels of sequence homology across the genome.
An earlier study of sick pangolins also reported the detection of viral contents in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used other methods of assembly and manual processing to obtain a genome sequence, comprising about 86.3% of the full-size viral genome.
It cannot be ruled out that the pangolin was one of the intermediate vectors of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus pangolins, related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from the pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-pangolin coronaviruses.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is not yet established.
While the highest sequence homology was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus pangolins, related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence homology within the entire genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between the beta-coronavirus pangolins, related to SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 is related to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal advocates a recombination between the beta-coronavirus of pangolins, a relative of SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in a third species of wild animals.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronavirus.
A final decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still not available.
In addition to the high pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 is also being studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may originate from bat coronaviruses, while parent viruses of the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains have been found in rodents.
It has been reported that the bat coronavirus, named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and detected in the North American three-colored suckerfoot, demonstrates close affinity with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that camels could be intermediate carriers.
For clarity, current knowledge about the animal origin of known coronavirus is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of HCoVs' history of interspecies transmission.
When the HCoV-OC43 virus was transmitted between species around 1890 and people were infected from pets, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Bat alphacoronaviruses, closely related to HCoV-229E, were found.
Between them is the alpaca coronavirus.
There's some evidence to support direct transmission from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacas, who could contact the bats in a shared ecological niche.
At the same time, humans are in close contact with the alpacas.
Second, bat alfalfacoronaviruses, related to HCoV-229E, are diverse and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpaca alfalfacoronaviruses have caused respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca alpaca coronavirus has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that alpacas may have received the alphacoronavirus, a relative of HCoV-229E, from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra.
So it's not surprising that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alfalfacoronaviruses may have served as a gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and unicorns may have been intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as MERS-CoV did.
MERS-CoV is a good example of interspecies transmission from bats to unicorns and from unicorns to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known from its initial identification and has subsequently been confirmed by subsequent studies.
It's clear that bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for interspecies gene exchange and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, dense colonies, close social interaction, and the ability to fly make bats "ideal spreaders".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV was introduced into camels decades ago.
It adapted well to these camels, which went from being an intermediate carrier to a stable and natural reservoir carrier.
In these animals, MERS-CoV is a very mild disease and is characterized by a relatively low frequency of mutations.
Its episodic transmission to humans is accidental, and humans remain a dead end carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, betacoronavirus of pangolins is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be the deadliest carriers of the betacoronavirus, related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as the civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies need to confirm or rule out several possibilities of interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, bats may be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, which is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats by mining or cutting the carcasses of these animals.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate reinforcing carriers that the related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently gotten into.
People are infected by cutting up their faces and eating the flesh of wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Testing domestic and wild animals for antibodies is warranted.
Third, as noted above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that came into contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for an animal origin for SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three major factors from viruses also contributed to the crossing of the interspecies barriers.
First, they have a relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the estimated frequency of coronavirus mutations is considered moderately high with an average replacement frequency of approximately 104 replacements per year at one site 2 depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronavirus have a corrective exoribonuclease, which removal leads to an extremely high rate of mutation and weakening or even death.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdecivir suppresses the replication of coronavirus by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdecivir  is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs that needs to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of mutations in coronavirus is almost a million times higher than that of their carriers.
In addition, the frequency of mutation can often be even higher if the coronavirus is not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoVs with high mutation rates, SARS-CoV-2's mutation rate is apparently lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It's believed that the virus has already adapted to another vector similar to humans.
Aside from SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to one-horned camels.
It is theoretically unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antiviral drugs will quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronavirus leads to greater flexibility in genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution that is conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses under the right conditions.
This is facilitated by the numerous unique open reading frameworks and functions of proteins encoded in the 3′-end direction of the genome.
Third, due to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrix during RNA replication.
During transcription of the coronavirus DNA in the carrier, which serves as a mixing vessel, frequent threading occurs.
High-homology full-size and subgenome RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Phyllogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animal coronaviruses such as bat bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
The virus carrier interaction with regard to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, another key factor important for interspecies transmission is the interaction of the virus with the host receptor.
This article presents the recombination of SARS-CoV as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV adapts rapidly to different carriers, especially with respect to mutations on the S protein RSD.
In general, the S-protein RNA of the coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor, and the carrier's antibody response intensively selects it.
SARS-CoV  RSD is the amino acid, 318th to 510th, on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (APF2) and its coreceptors to introduce the virus into the cell.
SARS-CoV RNA is able to recognize APF2 receptors in various animals, including bats, civets, mice and an enotated dog, making it possible for the virus to be transmitted between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in the RSD that are different from human and civet virus strains, with 4 of them in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV cyvettes have K479N and S487T mutations in the RSD, which may increase the affinity of the spike protein's interaction with the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be particularly important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 segment of the S protein leads to the fact that the binding affinity of the S protein to human APF2 may have changed.
Indeed, a study using a cryoprotect microscope says that the affinity of this bond is 10 times higher than between human APF2 and the S protein of the SARS-CoV.
It would also be interesting to determine if any other correceptors are required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to APF2, but to a different segment of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as N-amino peptidase for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsilic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus in humans after interspecies transmission from animal hosts.
In addition to cell receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of carrier dependence and restriction.
Divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, unicorns, and rodents, may be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For successful interspecies transmission, HCoVs must usurp the factors of dependence and subordinate the factors of carrier restriction.
In this respect, the molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can be obtained by unbiased full-genome screening of the dependence factors and restriction of carriers for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
New HCoVs: back to zero
The diversity of bat coronavirus creates wide opportunities for new HCoVs to emerge.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force behind HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes that code for proteins has the potential to radically modify the phenotypes of viruses.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, as bat viruses, related to SARS-CoV, have been isolated but found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide deletion was found, characteristic of SARS-CoVs.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates the transfer of hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination with alpha and gamma coronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination localizations have also been identified in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV was subjected to recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in Saudi Arabian one-eyed camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal coronavirus in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely as a result of the virus being freed from selective pressures, for example from the host's immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to two-nucleotide deletion.
While the intact open reading frame of ORF4 can be seen in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alphacoronavirus demonstrates a single-nucleotide insertion, leading to a shifting frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressure on their reservoir carriers.
Bat infections with coronavirus have been reported with little or no symptoms, suggesting a mutual adaptation between coronavirus and bats.
It turns out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronavirus.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronavirus.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to the April regulation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell inhibitory receptor and the low level of expression of the I-class major histological compatibility complex molecules.
Moreover, the high levels of active oxygen forms, which are provided by the high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, while also affecting the readability of the exoribonuclease, thus creating a selection pressure to generate strains of the virus that, when introduced into a new carrier, are highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic strains of coronavirus can also evolve through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the carrier.
So it's no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last 20 years.
Coronavirus are nonpathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They replicate confidently without triggering a strong immune response in the host.
That's the secret to why we see asymptomatic carriers, and what causes severe human infections.
Severe symptoms are associated primarily with an overactivated immune response and a cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is not associated with replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy of unbinding the immune response may have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
Bats have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, interferon type I should have a beneficial effect, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, bat activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was impaired.
Based on this, inhibiting NLRP3-inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat betacoronavirus has been found to have 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also bat coronavirus with 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals in markets have been found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin betacoronavirus have been found to be remarkably homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins may have served as an intermediate carrier or that fragments of pangolin betacoronavirus genes may have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
Coronavirus has attracted worldwide attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoVs in human transmission.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and have been transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and ticks in markets, closing game markets and killing ticks on them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in light of the discovery of diverse strains of beta-coronavirus pangolins, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, to prevent zoonotic transmission of infection from food markets, pangolins should be removed.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals and how this may occur remains a matter of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has been around for a long time in one-eyed camels.
These camels are an important means of transportation, as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
So it's not possible to donate all camels to control MERS, as was done in the wildlife markets of China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach to developing an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels in combination with other infection control measures is needed.
Since we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can emerge that cause outbreaks.
There are a variety of zoonotic coronaviruses circulating in the world.
In particular, the bat coronavirus is extremely diverse with zoonotic potential.
There is a huge amount of potential for these zoonotic coronaviruses to evolve and recombine, which in the future will lead to new coronaviruses that are more transmissible and/or more lethal to humans.
To reduce the number of unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be abandoned.
After the severe tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans are needed.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until the opportunity arises to take new territories.
Although many of the traits of bats are conducive to the spread of viruses, teaching people to stay away from them can minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife.
To better understand the ecology of coronavirus and their natural vectors, ongoing epidemiological surveillance of mammals is needed, which will be useful for preventing transmission of coronavirus from animals to humans and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
The puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 still lacks some fragments.
First, if bats have transmitted the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it's interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, then we need to determine how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if the third mammal is the true intermediate, then we need to figure out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.
Whether it's a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it's expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its precursor viruses will be detected in their natural hosts.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for suspected cases and confirmed cases of COVID-19 need to be updated
On 6 February 2020, our team published a brief reference guide on the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 (2019-nCoV) new coronavirus infection, which provides insights into our experience and provides sound recommendations for dealing with the pandemic worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has been gradually increased based on current research results and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment regarding our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for suspected cases and confirmed cases in accordance with the National Health Committee's Recommendation for Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19 (seventh version).
In December 2019, a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak occurred, now officially named coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was named severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a brief reference guide and published it online on the website of the journal Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This publication attracted a great deal of attention.
It should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has been gradually increased based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, from January 16 to March 3, 2020, seven issues of the document Refrequency on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were released, with some of its provisions substantially changed.
A recent paper by Zhou and his co-authors commented on our recommendations, providing simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations and has provided valuable background information on this global pandemic.
We acknowledge the high importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the Refrequences for Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19 (trial version 7) and the results of current studies, their work also needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition of this document (dated 3 March 2020), for conducting a comprehensive analysis when confirming a case of suspicion of disease , it is necessary to combine any one element of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or stay in Wuhan and its environs or in other settlements where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days before symptoms appeared; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (positive nucleic acid-based test); (3) history of contact with patients with high fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its environs or from other settlements where COVID-19 cases were reported within the last 14 days before symptoms appeared; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed illnesses (≥ 2 cases characterized by high fever or respiratory symptoms, recorded within 2 weeks in small premises such as a school, office or apartment).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) presence of external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) total leukocyte count is normal or decreased with decreased lymphocyte count at the early stage of symptom manifestation.
The diagnosis for a confirmed case of disease should be based on a case of suspected disease with one of the following items of pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) a real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full genome sequencing of the virus shows high homogeneity relative to novel coronaviruses; (3) positive serotests for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies; or a change in the test result from negative to positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies, or a titer increase of at least 4 times on phase-on-phase detection relative to the corresponding indicator in the acute phase.
It can also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions of the document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added.
Pathogenetic diagnosis of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then in the seventh edition the need for serological evidence was added.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers looking for the optimal set for detecting nucleic acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as for analyzing samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood samples, which increases the availability of different samples and facilitates the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirming the disease.
However, there is growing evidence that caution should be exercised in the treatment of patients with atypical symptoms and patients without pronounced symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in Zhou et al. should be updated, as it classifies individuals without clinical symptoms as a low-risk group.
The evaluation system also needs to be refined in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we hope to get more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
As for diagnosing suspected cases and confirmed cases, we encourage readers to follow and strictly follow the latest recommendations given in the countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19  daily maximum
Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths in a day yesterday.
That's the highest number of deaths from the virus in a single day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of reported cases included 114 current cases, as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR director Dr Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said four men and one woman were killed.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the deceased were over the age of 60, two were between the ages of 51 and 60, and one was 41 to 50 years old.
She also reported that the two dead were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic of COVID-19.
A clinic employee told local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwait Metri clinic.
In an online video statement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaydul Quader said that public transport will be suspended for a longer period than originally planned, until next Saturday.
Public transportation has been suspended since March 26 and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods  medicines, fuel and food  was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on 8 March in two people who had returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three people have recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the millionth mark of infections worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide on Thursday exceeded one million.
At least 52 thousand people have died from the COVID-19 coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day as Malawi's first confirmed case of the virus and Zambia's first confirmed death from the coronavirus.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was one of the few countries in which no cases of coronavirus infection had been recorded.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 CET (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, of which at least 5,900 have been fatal.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths were recorded in the United States on Wednesday due to coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the self-isolation regime for the city's citizens until May 1.
Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians across the country, despite self-isolation, will receive their salaries until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the results of the vote: 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, whereas previously the curfew lasted only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the statewide self-isolation order has been extended through May 1.
Stores in Australia are limiting the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at a time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australia's Woolworths and Coles retail chains reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time at all stores in the country to two and one packages, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a one-pack limit.
The restrictions were announced in advertisements at the box office and on Facebook.
Citizens reportedly began to make emergency supplies due to fears that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of a general self-isolation regime.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the amount of toilet paper it purchased to one pack.
Earlier, on March 4 and 5, respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this to 4 packages.
Coles in its March 8 press release said that with the introduction of a four-pack limit, many stores are still buying toilet paper too quickly, calling the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI in a Facebook post published on Tuesday called the trend "unexpected".
According to a Woolworths representative, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
Costco in Canberra last week also limited that to two packs.
To fill the shortage, Coles began ordering larger batches from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional batches, while ALDI made stocks for a special early sale promotion on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to replenish their stock but were hampered by local government restrictions on the timetable for trucks.
He expects the cost of production to rise as suppliers try to meet demand, but with fewer and fewer good offers available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to the depletion of supplies, some stores could not hold events on Wednesdays.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores are replenishing their stores every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, so the number of storage stocks is small, and after selling the entire volume of the commodity, long rows of shelves remain empty, increasing the feeling of lack of stock.
Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled, and goods like toilet paper rolls and hand sanitizers could be placed on those shelves in large quantities, customers probably wouldn't panic so much, says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap announced that it was out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the toilet paper company Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, which also makes Sorbent products, said they are working around the clock to ensure sufficient supplies.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne declined due to a lack of buyers during Labor Day weekend, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first bidders.
The fourth issue of the Darwin-based daily NT News included an eight-page tab designed to be cut out and used as toilet paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions on the amount of goods they could buy, saying they had no plans to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, gallantry, hand washing products and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, it was noted on Sunday evening that the British online supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared a COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term "pandemic" only describes the scale of the disease, not the danger of specific cases, WHO notes that governments need to take action:
All countries together are still able to influence the course of the pandemic.
This is possible if countries identify, test, treat, isolate, monitor and mobilize their citizens, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
"We are deeply concerned both by the alarming level of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction".
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented".
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that "no other respiratory virus other than influenza has been traced from its emergence to its continuing global spread".
Mr. Hebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying that we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We've also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.
First, in January, the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and then re-designated it a pandemic.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak: "It's just the beginning, and it's going to get worse".
According to the Associated Press, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 in the world as of Thursday, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020 is the ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020 an international public health emergency was declared, which was subsequently declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, there were approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China is 4%, while in the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping people apart, identifying and isolating people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls, and closing down facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, with sporting, religious, political and cultural events postponed or cancelled, as well as widespread shortages of goods, compounded by panic shopping.
Schools and universities were closed at national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's students.
Internet disinformation about the virus began to spread, and there were cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and Southeast Asia, or people who resemble them in appearance, and against other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of the virus have been reported.
As a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of Wuhan (the capital of Hubei Province), China, reported the occurrence of pneumonia with unknown cause, and in early January 2020, an investigation into the situation was initiated.
The cases were mostly linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to have zoonotic origins.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that has a lot of similarities to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two-thirds of the cases reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified article in the South China section of the Morning Post suggested that the first case was a 55-year-old man from Hubei province on 17 November 2019.[citation needed] On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases in China had decreased, but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
The incidence of the disease may be significantly reduced, in particular because of the high number of cases with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, there were relatively few cases among young people, with patients aged 19 and under accounting for less than 2.4% of cases worldwide.The UK's Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Wallans estimated that 60% of the UK population would be infected by the time effective group immunity is formed in the country's population.
The statistics include cases of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test results are positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has been able to test more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have adopted official policies that require no testing for only minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that 86% of COVID-19 cases in China had gone undetected by 23 January, and that such unregistered patients were the source of infection for 79% of the cases reported.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual cases in Italy was significantly higher than the number of registered cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive infection number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the figure may be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients are recovering well.
In other, more complex cases, the time from onset of symptoms to death was 6 to 41 days, with the most common time being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were in people over 60 years of age, and 75% of those who died had comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include deaths of patients who tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not include deaths of people who did not pass testing  for example, in cases of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID figures by 45 times.
A spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: "We know that [the reported death toll] is lower than the actual number". His words are corroborated by reports of some isolated cases in the US.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on February 1 in the Philippines, and outside Asia  in France on February 14.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths.
All indicators vary by region and time of spread; they are also influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment regimens used, the time since the outbreak, and population parameters such as age, gender, and general health status.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204).
The data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality-to-disease ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those who developed symptoms on January 1, 2020) to 0.7% (for those who developed symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other methods include determining the percentage of disease-related deaths (CFR)  the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease, and the percentage of infection-related deaths (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the performance of specific populations from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these numbers for specific groups of people.
According to the Oxford University Evidence Medicine Center, the overall mortality rate from this pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39%.
The upper figure in this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR scores.
WHO says the current pandemic is manageable.
The exact peak and duration of the flare cannot be determined and may vary depending on location.
Macey Bonney of Penn State University says that uncontrolled outbreaks tend to plateau, and then when the available carriers run out, they begin to subside.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.
Senior Chinese government medical adviser Jung Nansheng says that "it could be over by June" if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 will be circulating, perhaps, for a year or two.
According to a study conducted by Imperial College under the direction of Neil Ferguson, until a vaccine is developed (possibly 18 months or more), physical distancing and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University believes, "I don't think this coronavirus will ever go away completely because it's so easily transmitted, and it can become a seasonal disease, with outbreaks every year".
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively nonspecific, and some infected people may carry the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, mucus in the airways (mucus), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, bloodthirst, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO claims that about one in six people develops a serious form of the disease with the development of respiratory problems.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists such urgent symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or a feeling of tightness, sudden feeling of confusion, difficulty waking up, and redness of the face or lips.
Some people who are infected may have the disease asymptomatically, without any clinical signs, but the results of the tests confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend that people who are in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed be placed under strict monitoring and tested for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate that the number of cases of asymptomatic course of the disease ranges from a few to 44% of all cases.
The typical incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. While there is no complete clarity on the symptoms of loss of smell, the percentage of COVID-19 patients who developed this symptom was initially estimated at 30%, and then dropped to 15%.
Some details about the ways the disease is spread are still unknown.
It is thought that the disease is transmitted mainly during close contact, as well as through small droplets released into the air along with coughing, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Some studies have shown that when coughing openly, the drop can spread to a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There is speculation that the virus may also be transmitted through small droplets thrown into the air during conversation, which are able to stay in the air for longer periods of time. Respiratory droplets may also form when breathing out, including during conversation, although the virus is not usually transmitted through the air.
Drops can enter the mouth or nose of people nearby, as well as the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the products of the breath to be sprayed and, therefore, the virus to spread in the air.
It can also enter the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his or her eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this method of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although its spread can occur both before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where the tests have been positive three days before symptoms appear, suggesting the possibility of transmission before symptoms are manifest.
There are few laboratory-confirmed reports of asymptomatic disease, but contact tracing studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from asymptomatic carriers.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one person normally infects 2 to 3 other people, and the virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that on plastic surfaces (polypropylene) and stainless steel (304) the virus can live up to three days, on cardboard surfaces  for one day, and on copper surfaces  for up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature, and pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the UK government recommends washing your hands after contact with animals, just as you should after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from the acute respiratory disease group recorded in Wuhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in related coronavirus. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed with a household soap that dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 has a lot of similarities to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it clusters genetically with the Betacoronavirus genus, a subgenus of Sarbecovirus (cell line B) together with two other strains of bat viruses.
At the whole-genome level, it's 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the sequences of the genome of the pangolin and human viruses.
A whole-genome comparison to date has shown the largest percentage (92%) of similarity between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
Infection with the virus can be diagnosed early on on the basis of symptoms, although this must ultimately be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription (PCR) analysis of the infected secretion or computed tomography.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its imaging functions are consistent with other pneumonias and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in the diagnosis of COVID-19.
WHO has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, and the first of these was published on 17 January.
Testing is performed for polymerase chain reaction in real time (RT-PCR).
It can be done on breath samples and blood samples.
The results are usually ready within a period of a few hours to a few days.
The test is usually performed using nasolacrimal swabs, although a zebra swab may also be used.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them have been sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, the serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of imaging symptoms on X-rays and computer tomography (CT) include asymmetrical peripheral cloudiness of the matte glass type and absence of pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for compiling an international database of confirmed cases.
Because of similarities with other infections, such as adenovirus, in identifying COVID-19, images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.
A large study in China compared chest CT scans with PCR tests and found that while the images are less specific for infection, they can be deciphered faster; they are also more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.
To diagnose the virus using X-rays and computed tomography, convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed.
Strategies for preventing transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, and using handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already be infected should wear a medical mask in public.
To prevent transmission, physical distancing is also recommended, and many governments recommend that people refrain from any unnecessary travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak, and restrict the movement of citizens.
However, the virus has been able to spread to most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading among a population whose members do not know where or how they were infected. Healthcare workers caring for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions when in contact with other people and eye protection. Contact tracing is also an important method used by health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent its further spread.
The use of governmental data on the location of citizens using their mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and organizations such as Amnesty International, as well as more than 100 other organizations, have issued statements calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been developed and offered for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on solutions that ensure the privacy of personal data  for example, registering the user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, they receive a notification. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection  such as washing your nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working on it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC also recommends washing hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or if you have heavily contaminated hands, and before eating, after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is necessary because, when outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol content.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (the surface of stainless steel is disinfected one minute after application) containing 62% ethanol, 50% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2% polydone-iodine.
Other components, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if COVID is suspected or confirmed in an institution such as an office or day care center, all areas of such an establishment, including offices, toilets, common areas, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that when coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with a back of your elbow or a napkin and immediately throw away used hygiene items.
Those who may have been infected are advised to wear medical masks, as masks can limit the volume and range of airborne respiratory products that are dispersed in the air when talking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their face, and touching the face with dirty hands is the main way of infecting". Masks are also recommended for those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people only wear medical masks if they are at high risk, such as those who care for someone with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks does reduce the number of face-to-face contacts.
Several countries have begun to advocate the use of medical masks in public places.
The US CDC recommends wearing non-medical fabric face masks. China has separately stressed the importance of single-use medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, people are not allowed to go outside without masks covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, the Vietnamese government asked all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for all grocery store visitors to wear medical masks.
The Israeli government also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.
On April 1, Taiwan, which has been producing ten million medical masks a day since mid-March, ordered all passengers on trains and intercity buses to wear masks.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask when outdoors; those who cannot afford to buy masks have been advised to sew them at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by people in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing)  is an infection control measure aimed at slowing the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantines, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping malls.
People can use social distancing measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments in regions, especially those hard hit by the outbreak, are now prescribing or recommending social distancing.
The maximum number of people who can gather in one place as recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (in regions with no data on COVID-19), to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of contracting the virus in a serious form. The CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak in the region. In late March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began replacing the use of the term social distancing with physical distancing, thus clarifying the purpose of this measure to reduce physical contact within social networks, whether through virtual communication or physical distancing.
The use of the term "social distancing" has been understood to mean that people should be subjected to complete social isolation, rather than staying in contact with other people in alternative ways.
Among other things, it has been recommended to only have sex with your regular partners, with whom you live, and who you are sure are free of the virus and its symptoms.
Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are infected are advised to self-isolate at home.
Health authorities have published detailed guidelines on self-isolation, and governments in many countries have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for all people in affected areas.
Those in high-risk groups were given strict quarantine.
Individuals who may have been in contact with COVID-19 infected persons, or have recently visited a country or region significantly affected by the epidemic, were advised to quarantine for 14 days from the time of their last possible contact.
Outbreak management strategies include containment, suppression or mitigation.
Prevention is carried out at an early stage and is aimed at tracking and isolating those infected, and includes other infection control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
At a stage when the spread of the disease is no longer contained, efforts are made to mitigate the effects: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the spread of the disease may be taken simultaneously.
Infection suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of infectious disease is focused on reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as the Equalization of the Epidemic Curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of health services becoming overloaded and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help manage the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass events; community involvement in facilitating and participating in such measures; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, as well as a system to alert people of the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to infected individuals who were self-isolating and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks has been increased and fines have been imposed for accumulating excess medicines, and modelling in the UK and the US has shown that there are serious problems with mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the growth of the epidemic).
The best policies to mitigate the spread of disease can reduce peak healthcare burden by two-thirds and death rates by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and healthcare collapse.
Suppression may be the preferred method, but it must be used as long as the virus is circulating in the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if this happens earlier), as otherwise the spread of the disease will resume quickly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to curb the pandemic have a social and economic cost.
There are currently no antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking plenty of fluids, and resting can help ease symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid administration, and breathing support.
The use of steroids can only harm.
Several compounds that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some traditional and home remedies may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity building and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients as the primary response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO European Regional Office have issued guidelines for primary care clinics and services to facilitate resource redistribution at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating late procedures where possible, detecting the virus and isolating patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, and expanding intensive care capabilities through staff training and increasing the number of available IVA devices and beds.
There are various theories about where the very first case of infection - the so-called "zero patient" - may have originated.
The first known case of the new coronavirus infection was probably on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei province has been gradually increasing.
They were mainly associated with the wholesale seafood market of Huanan, where live animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a case of mass illness with pneumonia of unknown origin was registered in a clinic in Hubei province, with which the doctor Zhang Tianjin worked, who reported the case on December 27 to the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan's central hospital warned their colleagues about the SARS-like coronavirus.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenlian, were warned by the police of responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising panic.
Later, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed WHO of the situation.
Wuhan health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which was large enough to initiate an investigation in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and main rail hub.
On January 20, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two cases in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to the latest official data, by January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had developed symptoms of the disease. As of March 26, the United States had surpassed China and Italy in the world for the largest number of confirmed cases. As of April 9, 2020, there were more than 1.61 million cases worldwide, more than 97,000 deaths, and more than 364,000 recoveries.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one recorded case.
Due to the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National response measures included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory stay-at-home, mandatory shelter, or isolation), and curfew. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population of the United States, were in some form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are in isolation in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in isolation in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later that number had risen to 2.6 billion people - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, the validity of which has not been verified, this date is  17 November.
On December 26, Zhang Jissian worked with a case of mass pneumonia of unknown type, which her clinic notified the Jianghan Disease Control and Prevention Center in Wuhan on December 27.
The initial genetic testing of patients' samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, showed the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
WHO was notified the same day.
In response to such reports, the police have warned doctors in Wuhan of responsibility for spreading rumors of the outbreak.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of the newly discovered virus' ability to spread from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, which was later dubbed the "People's War" by Communist Party of China General Secretary Xi Jinping.
The events of the "largest-scale quarantine in human history" began to unfold, with a sanity cordon and a ban on entry into and return from Wuhan announced on January 23, later extending to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province and affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The city has banned the use of personal transport.
In many places, celebrations of the Chinese New Year (January 25) were canceled.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Huoshenshang, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital was built, Leishenshan, which received other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also re-profiled 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health certificates for travelers and extending the Chinese New Year celebration period.
Universities and schools were closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular in relation to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, authorities have introduced remote working.
Travel restrictions were imposed in Hubei province and beyond.
Public transportation was altered, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Many cities have imposed a movement control regime, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) have faced some form of outdoor movement restrictions.After the outbreak entered a global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the importation of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. As of March 23, only one case of infection in China had been reported from within the country, which occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang announced that the spread of domestically transmitted cases had been largely halted, and the outbreak in China had been brought under control.
On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that from 28 March, entry for persons with visas or residence permits would be suspended.
Those who wish to come to China will have to apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
On 30 March, the Chinese government urged enterprises and factories to resume operations and provided companies with monetary incentive packages. On 4 April, a national three-minute  minute of silence was held at 10:00 a.m. to mark the day of mourning for the victims of the coronavirus declared by the State Council and coinciding with the Qinmin holiday, but the central government asked citizens to pay tribute to the victims online, observing physical distancing to avoid a repeat outbreak of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
On February 20, the National Health Ministry reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, largely due to the large number of followers of a new religious movement known as Shinchonjji Jesus Church.
Shinchonjie's followers came to Tegu from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 (about 13%) of the 9,336 church members reported having symptoms of the disease.
On February 28, Korea recorded more than 2,000 confirmed cases, and by February 29, the number had risen to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases have been quarantined after three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
The outbreak affected travel, so the airline flight schedule was changed. South Korea has deployed a program of population screening for the virus, contact tracing and quarantine for contacts, which is considered the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
Screening methods included mandatory notification of symptoms via a mobile app by all arriving from abroad, a full-scale virus test, the results of which were ready the next day, and expanded testing capabilities, allowing up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's program is considered successful in fighting the outbreak, despite the fact that it did not isolate entire cities.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Mooney to be impeached for what they felt was an inadequate government response to the outbreak.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had recorded the lowest total number of cases in a single day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that from April 1 all new arrivals from abroad would be placed in a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, 121 countries requested South Korea's help in testing for the virus on April 1.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures introduced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sports events, Friday prayers, as well as the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the government does not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individual individuals will be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to restrict inter-city travel, but intensive travel between cities continued before the Persian New Year.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020, with Iran becoming the centre of the virus' spread after China in February.
Amid claims of covering up the extent of the outbreak in Iran, as of February 28, more than a dozen countries had linked their cases to Iran, indicating that the extent of the outbreak there may be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to date.
Iran's parliament was shut down, and 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus, as reported on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as temporarily release all prisoners who fit the category.
The organization says there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed institutions such as prisons where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day  the highest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By March 23, Iran was recording 50 new cases of coronavirus every hour and one new death from the virus every ten minutes.
According to a WHO official, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than the official figures.
It is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran could affect the country's financial capabilities to protect against the spread of the virus.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded an easing of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease had reached Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The number of cases began to rise rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later discovered, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February, and on 22 February the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were quarantined.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "Entrance into and exit from the outbreak zone will be blocked".
On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country, as 100 deaths had already been recorded in Italy at the time.
All major sporting events, including A-League football matches, were due to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics regarding protocols for establishing the order of care for patients, which may have to be invoked.
On March 19, Italy overtook China in coronavirus deaths, ranking first in the world, after announcing 3,405 deaths.
On March 22, it became known that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries, with most of these cases concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report notes that the high death rate in Italy may be due to a combination of two factors  the large number of elderly citizens in the country and the lack of ability to screen everyone who is currently infected with the coronavirus.
The United Kingdom has responded to the virus most calmly of all the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020 the British government did not require citizens to observe any form of social distancing or quarantine measures.
As a result, the government was criticised for not responding quickly and seriously to the danger facing the country's population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending abstaining from all non-essential travel and social contact, offering people to work from home whenever possible and to avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all entertainment establishments such as pubs and sports clubs should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens up to 80% of their wages, but no more than £2,500 a month, as a measure to support the population during the crisis.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were introduced with the involvement of the police, the introduction of fines and the dispersal of crowds.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except for those that provide "lifestyle activities" for the population, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, convenience stores, gas stations and garages.
On January 20, a man who returned from Wuhan in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington had the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the country.
On January 29, the White House established a Task Force on the fight against coronavirus.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading U.S. government organization in public health, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite this, testing of the population in the United States was not started immediately, and as a result the true extent of the outbreak during this period was hidden.
Testing was hampered by the lack of test kits issued by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government permission to use non-state test kits developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics until the end of February, and the lack of restrictive criteria until early March that would allow citizens to be tested (this could only be done on the appointment of the attending physician).
The Washington Post reported that by February 27, fewer than 4,000 tests had been performed in the United States.
The Atlantic reported that by March 13 less than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, Associated Press reported: Many patients, even with symptoms and a doctor's appointment, waited hours or days for their test lines After Washington State reported the first coronavirus death in the United States on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, which was soon followed by other states.
On March 3, classes were canceled in Seattle schools, and by mid-March schools were closed across the country. On March 6, 2020, a team of epidemiologists from Imperial College, London, informed the United States of the predictions of the impact of the new coronavirus on the country.

Corporations imposed travel restrictions on employees, cancelled conferences, and encouraged employees to work from home.
Sports events and seasons were cancelled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions in most of Europe, except the UK, for 30 days, beginning on March 13.
The next day, he expanded the restrictions to include the United Kingdom and Ireland.
On March 13, the president declared a state of emergency in the country, which allowed the use of federal funds to combat the crisis.
Starting March 15, many companies have been closing or reducing hours across the United States to help fight the spread of the virus.
By March 17, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. On March 23, it was reported that New York City had recorded 10,700 cases per day, exceeding the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the governor said that social distancing is likely to be an effective measure, as estimates of doubling the number of cases have dropped from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, New York City had 32,308 confirmed cases and 672 deaths. It was reported that on March 26, the United States had more confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of April 8, the United States had 400,335 confirmed cases and 12,841 deaths.
According to media reports from March 30, President Trump has decided to extend the social distancing period until April 30.
On the same day, the 1,000-bed hospital ship USNS Comfort docked in New York City.
On April 3, 884 deaths from coronavirus were recorded in the United States over the course of 24 hours.
The number of cases in New York State surpassed 100,000 on April 3. The White House has been criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring information that comes into the open by using the office of Vice President Mike Pence to monitor public statements and publications by health officials and scientists related to the virus.
In general, President Trump's supporters are divided on how well he is managing the crisis.
Some officials and commentators have criticized the U.S. dependence on importing critical materials, including necessities, from China.
In mid-January 2020, the journal Travel Medicine published an analysis of air travel patterns that was used to map and predict disease spread patterns.
Based on 2018 data from the International Air Transport Association, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the most travelers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist destinations, Bali was named the least prepared for the outbreak, while Australian cities are considered the most prepared.
In this regard, it is said that much remains to be learned about COVID-19, and that Australia will pay special attention to border control and communications in a threat situation.
On 21 March, Australia declared a human biosecurity emergency.
Due to the effective quarantine measures applied in the public transport sector in Wuhan and Hubei, some countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through charter flights from their home countries, which the Chinese authorities have given their permission to do.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first to plan to evacuate their citizens.
Pakistan has stated that it is not going to evacuate its citizens from China.

On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate U.S. citizens aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
On February 21, a plane carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess landed in Trenton, Ontario.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, a South African Airways aircraft chartered by the South African government took off with 112 South African citizens on board.
Passengers were screened before departure, and four South Africans who had tested positive for coronavirus were left in China to reduce the risk.
Only South Africans with negative coronavirus tests were evacuated.
All South African citizens, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, were tested and as a precaution all remained under observation and quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort.
On March 20, the United States began a partial withdrawal of its troops from Iraq in response to the pandemic.
On February 5, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had sent their aid to China.
Some Chinese students studying at American universities have joined forces to collect and send aid to regions of China affected by the virus, with a group from Chicago reportedly sending 50,000 N95 respirators to clinics in Hubei province on January 30. Direct Relief, a humanitarian aid organization, in partnership with FedEx, has sent 200,000 medical masks and other personal protective equipment, including gloves and vests, to Wuhan Union clinic by 30 January.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to WHO to fund the development of a vaccine and treatment for coronavirus, as well as to protect the population of "risk groups in Africa and South Asia" from the threat of the virus.
Interaksyon reported that on February 6, the Chinese government donated 200,000 medical masks to the Philippines after Senator Richard Gordon sent 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.
On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it was going to send $2.26 million in aid to China.
Japan also donated one million medical masks to Wuhan, Turkey sent medical equipment there, Russia  over 13 tons of medicines, Malaysia announced the donation of 18 million medical gloves, Germany sent various medical supplies including 10,000 protective kits, the United States donated 17.8 tons of medicines, and also pledged $100 million in financial support to affected countries.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medicines and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma sent the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 1.1 million test kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits for the organization to distribute to its member states.
He later also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks and 5 IVL devices to Panama.
Ma also donated medicines to Canada, where the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concern about Chinese-made medical masks and testing kits.
For example, Spain recalled 58,000 Chinese coronavirus test kits, which are only up to 30 percent accurate, and the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable medical masks: they were supposed to have been made in China, but later turned out to have come from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank began implementing emergency assistance operations to developing countries.
WHO praised the Chinese authorities' efforts to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of the infection.
WHO noted the stark differences between the 2002-2004 outbreak of atypical pneumonia, which accused the Chinese authorities of withholding information that allegedly prevented the disease from spreading, and the current crisis, in which the central government regularly provided updated information to avoid panic on the eve of the Chinese New Year.
On 23 January, in response to the central government's decision to impose a ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO spokesman Gauden Galea noted that while the measure was definitely not recommended by WHO, it is also a very important confirmation of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the place of greatest spread, calling it "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, after the ability of the infection to be transmitted from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of infected in other countries was confirmed, WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC); this was the sixth such measure since 2009 when it was first applied during the swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the announcement of PHEIC was due to the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without reliable healthcare systems.
Commenting on the travel restrictions, Mr Tedros stated that there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international travel and trade and that WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement.
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the global community for US$675 million to ensure strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, signaling the need for urgent assistance to countries that have no systems to identify people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached these countries.
Mr Tedros also stated that the "indicator of our preparedness" is the degree of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest link, and urged the international community to "make a choice: invest today or pay in the future".
On the same day, Tedros announced that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide the "potential of the entire UN system" in response to the problem.
The result was the creation of a UN Crisis Management Group to coordinate all UN responses; these steps, WHO says, will "focus on health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to tackle the outbreak at a broader social and economic level".
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the creation of a joint task force that provided international experts and WHO staff on the ground in China to assist in the domestic settlement of the situation and assess the "seriousness of the disease and its contagiousness", organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, and visits to assess the "effectiveness of the response measures at the provincial and county level, including urban and rural areas". On 25 February, WHO said that the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that "it is still too early to call this disease a pandemic, but countries should be prepared".
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said the probability of global spread of the coronavirus would be raised from high to very high to the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's Emergency Health Programme, warned in a statement: "This is a test of every government on the planet's readiness to face the reality: it's time to act.
This virus may already be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared, and he also stressed that the right response can help the world avoid the worst-case scenario.
Ryan also stated that current data does not serve as a basis for public health officials to declare a global pandemic, and added that declaring a pandemic would mean that "we are essentially recognizing the fact that every person on the planet will be at risk of being infected with this virus".
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General stated that the WHO is "deeply concerned by both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction on the issue". The WHO has been severely criticized for what is considered an inadequate approach to the concept of a pandemic, including the later declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
In response to the situation, a petition to resign was submitted to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, which had 733,000 signatures as of 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of every person during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The panel stated that everyone has the right to life-saving measures, and the government has the responsibility to organize such measures.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including people with disabilities, minority groups, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other undeclared groups in need of state support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has created a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to provide feedback and recommendations.
The Digital Hub provides information on policies in different countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address the impact of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for their actions in fighting the pandemic that started in China's Hubei province.
Several provincial-level leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and these firings reflected dissatisfaction with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that the move was aimed at protecting Communist Party of China General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, disagreed with earlier claims that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, but sided with conspiracy theories that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The administration of US President Donald Trump has called the coronavirus the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that "the censorship in China only exacerbates the situation with the virus, which has now become a global pandemic", and this statement has been criticized by some commentators who argue that this approach is racist and "distracts from the US presidential administration's inability to contain the spread of the disease".
The Daily Beast has obtained a US government cable containing a strategic communication ploy apparently devised by the National Security Council, with such references to the strategy as: It's all in China.
We are being asked to spread this information by any means possible, including press conferences and television appearances. Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have said that China's efforts to help countries affected by the virus are part of a "propaganda effort" to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of the presence of a "geopolitical component, including the struggle for influence through PR and the so-called politics of generosity".
Borrell also said that China was pushing the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States.
China has also urged the US to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to some reports, sending aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba has been banned due to US sanctions imposed on April 3.
The US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid destined for other countries to their own country.
Disputes over medical masks have also arisen between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of IWLs intended for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for Italy's coronavirus outbreak.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said that only China responded in a bilateral manner.
This is not a clear sign of European solidarity.
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized the dispatch to Italy of Russian military sanitarians, specialized disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80% of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of trying to make a favorable impression on the world public at the "geopolitical and diplomatic" level.
Lombardy's President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media's attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "in offering assistance to his American colleagues, [Putin] is suggesting that as American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase their production rates, they too will be able to provide assistance in return if necessary".
NATO Defender-2020, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, will be the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Defender 2020 (Defender 2020) :  In the public health crisis that has developed today, conducting these exercises puts at risk not only the lives of the US military and many European participating countries, but also the lives of the people of the countries where such events are to be held.  The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani appealed to world leaders in an open letter asking for help, saying his country was struggling to combat the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to US sanctions against Iran. The epidemic has prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a unified health care and child care system, paid family leave, and increased funding for public health.
Political analysts had expected that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated places.
South Korean society was initially divided by President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for impeachment of Mr. Munoz for what they felt was an inadequate government response to the outbreak.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this move will allow governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, parliament voted to give Prime Minister Viktor Orban the indefinite right to rule by decree, suspend parliament, hold elections and punish those accused of spreading false information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been cited as a cause of several supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic buying and disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment, which have been caused by increased consumer demand and supply disruptions.
Panic shopping also occurred in several settlements, leading to the disappearance of staples such as food, toilet paper and bottled water from the store shelves, which in turn led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the tech industry is warning of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This jump led to a twenty-fold increase in prices compared to the usual price, as well as delays in the supply of medical products of four to six months.
It has also caused a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, and WHO has warned that health workers will be hit.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, daigoo buyers have been given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This activity led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food, acute food shortages were avoided in both areas.
The successful measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and illicit trade in critical products have avoided the acute food shortages that were expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, where agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but industry officials say prices may rise.
Food store shelves were only temporarily empty, even in Wuhan, while Chinese government officials made sure that pork stocks were available to ensure that the population was well fed.
Similar laws requiring food producers to store food supplies in case of emergency exist in Italy.
The damage to the global economy has been felt in China: according to media reports dated March 16, China's economy suffered heavily in the first two months of 2020 due to the government's measures to combat the spread of the virus, which resulted in retail sales falling by 20.5%.
Mainland China  is a major economic and manufacturing center; therefore, the virus outbreak is considered to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agatha Demarai, of the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that volatility in the markets will continue until a clearer picture of potential outcomes is seen.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could exceed that of the 2002-2004 outbreak of atypical pneumonia.
One estimate, by an expert at Washington University in St. Louis, estimates that the damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have taken "temporary measures" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to falling demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, amid growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, showed their sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow dropping 1191 points  the biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
By the end of the week, all three indices had fallen by more than 10 percent.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
Stocks fell again due to fears about the spread of the coronavirus, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
Many believe that there is a possibility of economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and governments.
Central banks are responding faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism  is one of the sectors most affected by travel restrictions, closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations not to travel at all.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in demand for air tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise industry has been more severe than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year celebrations.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of large-scale events, including annual New Year's Eve festivals; private companies have also shuttered their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year's events were canceled, and tourist attractions were closed to prevent mass gatherings of people; for example, the Forbidden City in Beijing was closed and traditional temple fairs were canceled.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, directing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong authorities have raised the response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling New Year celebrations.
Retail visits to Europe and Latin America have fallen by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East have reduced their sales by 50 to 60 percent.
As a result, in March, attendance at shopping malls fell by 3343% compared to February.
Shopping center operators around the world have taken additional measures, such as improving sanitation, installing equipment to check the temperature of visitors, and canceling events.According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic could leave 14.22 million more people on the brink of poverty than would have been the case in a similar situation but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of China's 300 million migrant rural workers are either stuck in their homes in their home provinces or trapped in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the government for help.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could put 47 million people out of work in the United States, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%.Self-isolation measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers without jobs, who receive daily wages.A study by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have somehow faced unemployment.Almost 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost their jobs since Spain introduced strict isolation in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit. Nearly half a million companies in Germany transferred their employees to government-subsidized shortened working hours  part-time.
The German part-time pay scheme was also introduced in France and the UK.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors have also been hit hard by the pandemic, which has affected the work of organizations as well as individuals, whether formally employed or self-employed, around the world.
Cultural and art organizations have tried to support their (often state-funded) mission of ensuring access to cultural heritage for the public by ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, and also, where possible, by supporting art people.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed around the world indefinitely, or access to them was restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed.
In return, there have been active efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms.Another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other public events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced the cancellation of the Holy Week in Rome, which is held during the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay home and avoid Sunday services; in some churches, church services have been broadcast on radio, live television, or television, while some church leaders have suggested that services be held outdoors.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed its churches, chapels and St. Peter's Square to visitors, where no Christian pilgrims are allowed to visit, and later other religious organizations also canceled services and limited access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and churches.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak, and shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and its own residents from visiting the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes to the calendar of world sporting events since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 UEFA Premier League, the 2019-20 UEFA Euro 2020 and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The coronavirus outbreak also destroyed plans to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin in late July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be postponed to after 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021. Casinos and other gambling establishments around the world were closed, and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast live, were also either postponed or canceled.
This has led to many players switching to online mode, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers.The entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway, also canceled all their productions.
As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians have explored ways to continue their work and share their results online, organizing live online concerts or web festivals; this helps people in creative professions to continue performing, releasing or publishing their works.
A number of internet memes have emerged on the topic of coronavirus, many of which are humorous and soothe the anxiety of times of uncertainty.
Since the onset of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese citizens and people of East Asian origin, as well as populations in hot spots in Europe, the US and other countries.
Cases of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
News reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China) recorded racist sentiments expressed by various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received just retribution for something.
In some African countries, there is also a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Chinese citizens, as well as those who live in the affected areas, were supported both offline and online.
The epidemic has started to spread in new countries, in particular Italy  the first country in Europe to face a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this regard, citizens of such regions may also begin to feel the effects of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed a petition at an early stage, insisting on banning Chinese citizens from entering their countries in order to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was the number one Twitter hashtag.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report rising levels of racist sentiment and even assault.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus"; critics consider this view racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan to New Sanjhar.
Students from China-bordered northeastern India and studying in major Indian cities have reported cases of persecution related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party State Branch, West Bengal, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and so God had avenged them.
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, who called them "misleading". In China, the pandemic has led to a resurgence of xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents, with foreigners being called "foreign garbage" and "objects to be disposed of".
Many paid-for newspapers have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles about the coronavirus outbreak public.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to their research results on pre-printing servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is only intended to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It's used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for population control purposes.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to be treated in hospital or who did not have them at all.
The exact mortality rate and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of this test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capabilities, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and the data on the number of tests conducted in different countries is highly conflicting.
Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on the death rates recorded, which may be significantly exaggerated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on breathing samples obtained by various methods, including nasolacrimal swabs or sputum samples.
Results are usually available within a period of a few hours to 2 days.
The CT-PCR test, which is done on swabs taken from the throat, is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected patients tested in the second week of illness, the alternative may be to take material from the lower respiratory tract with a suction catheter, or to use defecation products (moc).
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Charite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and was based on 250,000 sets, which were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its own test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a kit for detecting SARS-CoV-2 based on clinical-level PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects the E gene, common to all beta-coronavirus, and the RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive approval from the China National Drug Administration for the emergency use of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its real-time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) diagnostic panel for conducting real-time PCR-RT in public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource organization.
One of three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits gave incomplete results due to faulty reagents and the narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; the result was an average of less than 100 samples successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an emergency use authorization, and commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 based on RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics has been testing for COVID-19 nationwide since March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were stated; sampling and processing should be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VEKTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Supervision Service. It was reported that on March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to use the test, which can be performed in 3.5 hours on a large volume of samples, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to conduct trials of the Abbott m2000 system; previously, the FDA had issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for a test lasting approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can detect positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in as little as 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is currently developing a test using a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus, and hopes to get results in 15-20 minutes, similar to an express flu test.
A March 2020 review of the literature concluded that breast X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT scans may have value even before symptoms appear.
Typical signs detected during CT include two-sided multi-domain subpleural sealing foci of the type mat glass with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, the symptom of the stone bridge and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
Results of a study comparing PCR and CT techniques used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its imaging functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation not to use CT for screening or as a first-line testing method in diagnosing COVID-19.[citation needed] As of March 2020, the CDC recommends that PCR be used for initial screening.
The immune response to infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and for population control.
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to be performed by high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
CLT usually uses one peripheral blood sample, although serial samples may be used to track the immune response.
In PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by piercing the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, the blood-collection stage for sampling analysis is not required. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have passed all necessary registration procedures and can now extend their tests to antibodies.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has only approved one test for emergency authorization for use. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorizations to use their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples that have the ability to fight the virus.
The test is performed on several hundred samples over a few hours, and therefore works much faster than the usual PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected within 14 days of infection. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it had purchased were producing satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients suspected of having the virus to stay at home: emergency room staff hand the patient a sample tube, the patient spits in it, gives it back, and after a while receives the test results. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot home test of suspect cases, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting other clinic visitors, or the need to disinfect the ambulance if it was used to transport the patient. During express testing for COVID-19, when suspect cases are detected, a healthcare worker takes the test, using all appropriate precautions.
Express testing centers helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and largest testing procedures of any country. On March 2, the National Association of Compulsory Medical Insurance Doctors in Germany said it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient settings, whereas a week earlier it could only do 10,700 tests per week.
If the examination is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are covered by the health insurance.
According to Robert Koch, president of the Institute, Germany's total testing performance is 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, it was proposed to conduct express testing in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests given in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that as of the calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 tests for SARS-CoV-2 were taken, up to and including week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive. Researchers at the Israeli Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of simultaneously testing samples taken from 64 patients, combining the samples and conducting further tests only if the combined sample showed a positive result. In Wuhan on February 5, 2020, BGI opened a temporary laboratory with a surface area of 2,000 meters for emergency detection called  Ho-po (眼-Yōkyō or 火眼), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by BGI founder Wang Jian and completed in just 5 days; modeling showed that if this laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated pace, the incidence of disease in Hubei would have been 47% higher, and accordingly, the cost of quarantine would also have been twice as high.
After the Wuhan lab opened, Huo-Yang's laboratories were immediately opened in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in total 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day.[citation needed] Open Multiplex Origami Assays were released, which can test up to 1,122 patient tests for COVID19 using only 93 test tubes.[citation needed] Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, eliminating the need for robotic fluid manipulators.
By March, due to shortages and insufficient quantities of reagents, it became problematic to conduct mass testing in the EU, UK and US.
As a result, some authors turned to test sample processing protocols that provide for heating samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes with the goal of releasing RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March, it was announced that the coronavirus testing per capita that the United Arab Emirates currently conducts exceeds the performance of any other country, and that a large part of the population will soon be tested.
This was due to the ability to perform express testing, along with the acquisition of the Group 42 and BGI's mass population testing laboratory (created on the basis of their Huō-Yang Emergency Detection Laboratories in China).
This lab, which is deployed in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, and is the first laboratory of this scale in the world to operate outside of China.
Different testing options targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of the test kit, which is sent to low-income countries that lack the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, leading to a lack of test kits in the US. At the very beginning of the outbreak, China and the US had problems with the reliability of test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide the sufficient number of kits recommended by health experts.
And in South Korea, experts say, the widespread availability of testing has helped to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has been working to provide testing facilities, mostly in private labs.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increased testing demand caused by the rapid spread of the virus, many private laboratories in the United States, which received hundreds of thousands of test samples, were overloaded and stocks of material for sampling and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by the CDC had "defects", and for this reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private test development. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of using these kits were inaccurate.
The firm explained that the reason for the inaccuracy of the results could be the failure of the sample collection or the incorrect use of the sets.
The Spanish Ministry said that it would recall the kits that gave inaccurate results and replace them with other sets  sets from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased in China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test kits purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović suggested dumping them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, an employee of the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the test kits purchased from China had a "high level of errors" and the Ministry "has stopped using them". The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 it was announced that these kits were unfit for use.
Quarantine measures for individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring of people who had contact with such patients, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vovo, where the first person in Italy died of COVID-19, conducted two cycles of testing of the entire population of about 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.
The entrance to the settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
With intensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic was much less intense in Singapore than in other developed countries, and there were no extreme restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and shops.
Many events were cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore began to urge residents to stay home, but schools, which had their holidays ending on 23 March, reopened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also managed the pandemic with intensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions were less aggressive.
The statistical study found that countries with more tests than deaths had much lower death rates, probably because they were able to identify more patients with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without the resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 test results to one of 16 WHO control laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Seven of these 16 control labs are in Asia, five are in Europe, two are in Africa, one is in North America and one is in Australia.
In the following graph, the indicators of the column % positive results depend on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.
A country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher percentage of positive results than a country where all citizens are tested, regardless of whether they have symptoms of the virus, under otherwise equal conditions.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at certain critical times throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
A person can also contract respiratory diseases, such as the flu or the common cold, by touching his eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
Five critical times of the day when you should wash your hands with soap: before and after defecating, after washing your baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding your baby, before eating, and before and after cooking or handling raw meat, fish, and poultry.
If soap and water are not available, you can use ash to wash your hands.
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the patient care procedure.
After changing diapers or washing a baby after going to the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygienic actions related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before taking medicines or medical procedures can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and of chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is especially important for people who work in the food or medical fields, but it's also important for everyone else.
Handwashing is very good for health, for example, it minimizes the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections.
It also reduces the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing could lead to a slight increase in the growth rate of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce diarrhea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing clean water to low-income regions.
Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (ARDs) if it is practiced in every home, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of RA, is the leading cause of death among children under five, claiming the lives of about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia alone kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that making hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet a permanent habit can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitary activities carried out under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also prevents the onset of impetigo, a disease that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A small negative effect of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying out and, consequently, damage to the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that too frequent hand washing can lead to itching and scaling of the skin - a condition known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing may also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission: after defecation (urination, defecation), after washing the baby's buttocks (diaper change), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when you should wash your hands to prevent transmission are before or after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or sneezing, after touching animal waste or animal waste, after touching garbage.
In many countries, hand-washing with soap is not common.
A 2015 handwashing study in 54 countries found that, on average, 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap  is a common practice. A 2014 study found that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the US is closer to the middle on this list, with a rate of  77%; the lowest rate was recorded in China  23%. There are currently several methodologies for changing behavior and developing the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group handwashing of schoolchildren at a set time of day  is one of those methodologies that helps children learn this procedure.
The Philippine Ministry of Education's Emergency Medical Assistance Program is an example of a large-scale effort to improve children's health and education.
This national program is based on twice-a-year de-helminthization, daily handwashing with soap, and daily fluoride brushing.
The same program is being successfully conducted in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is more effective if soap or detergents are added during the washing process.
The main function of soap and detergents is to remove the barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water alone is not considered an effective means of cleansing the skin, since fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollutants, are poorly soluble in water.
Sufficient water, however, helps the purification process.
Solid soap, because of repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may have gotten on it during previous use.
The small number of studies that have found bacteria on the skin from a contaminated piece of solid soap suggest that the likelihood of such exposure is low, since the bacteria wash away with the foam.
The CDC still claims that "liquid hand-dose soap is the preferred option for hand washing".
Antibacterial soap is heavily promoted in health-conscious communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are inherently resistant to antibiotics.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective of antibacterial soap, their efficacy may not match the advertised one.
In addition to surface-active substances and skin-protective agents, complex compounds may contain acids (acidic, ascorbic, lactic) as pH regulators, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other bloaters (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that simple soaps are as effective as conventional antibacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the skin of the hands.
Hot water, at a temperature comfortable for human skin, is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at a body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius.
However, warm soap is more effective than cold water in removing natural fats that hold contaminants and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water does not reduce the microbial load on your hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand sanitizer that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based, water-free hand hygiene products (also known as alcohol-based hand disinfectants, hand disinfectants, or sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these products are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of a gel, or moisturizers such as glycerin in liquid or foam form, which provide ease of use of these products and reduce the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases the antimicrobial activity, and disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol are effective in killing germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multiple drug resistance bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (reduction logarithm 3.5 is equivalent to reduction by 35 decibels) on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99%  99.999% of bacteria (reduction logarithm 45) on the hands 1 minute after application.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are almost ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.
The facial and dorsal surfaces of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is completely absorbed.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you choose to wash your hands rather than use disinfectants, especially if your hands are heavily contaminated.
The popularity of these disinfectants is due to their ease of use and quick destruction of microorganisms, but they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing if soap and water are available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin if they do not contain softeners and/or skin moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other softening agents to the composition of the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing softening components caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact scarring syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives present in disinfectants are almost nonexistent.
The lower incidence of irritating contact dermatitis was a factor in the choice of disinfectants over soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, water-free products do not clean your hands of organic matter, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective at preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms as soap and water, since when hand sanitizers are used, the pathogenic microorganisms still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of a non-alcoholic hand sanitizer depends largely on the components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing products.
More recently, it has been shown that drugs that use benzalkonium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to lose its effectiveness after repeated use, likely due to progressive skin side effects.
Many people in low-income communities can't afford soap and replace it with gold or clay.
Soot or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if the clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can actually increase the spread of disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant, as it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends handwashing techniques that include the following steps:
Rub your hands in hot or cold running water.
It's recommended to use running water, because standing water can be contaminated, and the temperature of the water doesn't really matter.
Wash your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, as well as the areas between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that when people use soap (rather than just water) they tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Rub your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs are removed.
Rub your hands under running water.
Washing your hands in standing water can trigger re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel or let them dry on their own.
Wet and damp hands are more likely to get contaminated, and the areas most often overlooked are the big toe, wrist, fingertips, and undernails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain a variety of microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing lotion to prevent the skin from drying out, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: pouring water from a hanging can or bottle pumpkin with holes made and/or using ash if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. In places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as foot-pedal taps and other inexpensive options.
A foot pedal crane is a simple construction consisting of a container suspended on a rope and a foot lever that must be pressed to allow water to flow onto the hands; a piece of soap must be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of hand hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing body of research shows that paper towels are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Paper Towel and Paper Towel Symposium, which compared the hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air, and more modern flow air hand dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips increased by an average of 194 percent, and on the palms of the hands by 254 percent.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in an air-flow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips increased by 42 percent, and on the palms by 15 percent.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips decreases to an average of 76%, and on the palms of the hands  to 77%. The researchers also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several visitors to the toilet rooms and the toilet environment with each type of dryer.
The jet-air dryer, which releases air at a stated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms out of hands and from its own block and potentially infecting other users of the toilet room and toilet in a radius of up to 2 meters.
Using hand dryers with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate various methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed depending on the method of drying hands:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towels.
Hand sanitizing with disinfectant wipes may be an alternative solution when traveling without soap and water.
Hand sanitizer on the basis of alcohol must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Zemmelweiss discovered its high effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget to.
One study found that using such devices actually helps to reduce the rate of infection.
Medical handwashing lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and wipe each part of the hands.
Hands should be carefully rubbed together, fingers crossed.
If there is dirt under your nails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water on your hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying your hands, when closing the tap and, if necessary, when opening and closing any doors, use a paper towel.
This prevents re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in medical institutions is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (microbes) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing remains unacceptable in most medical settings, with many doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus spreading germs.
One study found that proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-associated blood flow infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a leaflet with a picture of a standard hand washing and treatment procedure that should be used in the health sector.
The draft WHO hand hygiene guidelines are also available on its website and are open for public discussion.
A corresponding review was co-authored by Whitby.
If compliance with the normative requirements is required, commercial devices can be used to measure the indicators and check hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization identifies five times when you should wash your hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before using the antiseptic, and
Adding antiseptic chemicals to hand-washing soap (medical soap or antimicrobial soap) helps kill bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgical operations or in an environment with a high content of organisms resistant to antibiotics. To clean your hands before surgery, a tap is needed that can be turned on and off without touching it; you should also use a little chlorhexidine or iodine water to rinse your hands, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterile rubbing brush and another sterile tool for cleaning your fingernails.
All the ornaments must be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms to the elbow usually for 26 minutes.
There's no need to rub your hands for too long, say 10 minutes.
During the rinse, water from the forearms should not fall back on the hands.
After the washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after a patient's care.
In the fight against staph infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand washing is achieved in the first 20 percent of the time, and that very little additional benefit is achieved when the frequency of hand washing is increased by more than 35 percent.
Compared to washing with antibacterial soap, handwashing with conventional soap results in more than a three-fold increase in the incidence of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. Comparing washing hands with an alcohol-containing solution and washing hands with antibacterial soap, an average of 30 seconds per procedure, showed that handwashing with an alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than alcohol hand sanitizers in reducing the number of hands infected with influenza A H1N1 and Clostridium difficile.Measures to improve hand hygiene in healthcare facilities may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-containing hand sanitizers, and writing and verbal reminders to staff on the need to wash their hands.
Further research is needed on the most effective measures in various healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and important means of improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of a stable water supply, soap, or handwashing products in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to practice regular handwashing.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every public or private toilet has a hand washing faucet, although there are inexpensive ways to arrange for hand washing in such places.
However, poor hand hygiene can also be caused by ingrained habits, not by a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and encouraging handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term changes in public behavior.
Monitoring and evaluation of results are necessary to ensure the effectiveness of such measures.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that community-level sanitary-epidemic surveillance is effective for improving hand hygiene in lower-middle-income countries, whereas public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of the United Nations Children's Fund's Three Star Approach is promoting simple economic measures in schools that encourage students to wash their hands with soap and other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring that the minimum standards are met, schools can increase their rating from one to three stars.
Installing hand washers is one of the possible measures implemented in the context of hand hygiene information campaigns to reduce the incidence and mortality of children.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund is promoting the use of emojis that symbolize hand washing.
Some studies have looked at the overall effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries compared to DALYs (saved life years without disability).
However, one study suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is a much more economical solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health  especially for vulnerable groups such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals  was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers in the field of hand hygiene: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and founder of modern nursing care.
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotting odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, with outbreaks of digestive diseases and healthcare-associated infections, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began to promote hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters with "correct handwashing techniques" were hung next to handwashers in public toilets, as well as in office buildings and airports.
The phrase wash your hands means to show your unwillingness to take responsibility for something or to be a part of something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate washed his hands when he decided to crucify Jesus Christ; the phrase subsequently gained wider usage in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth involuntarily begins washing her hands in an attempt to cleanse herself of an imaginary stain, symbolizing a guilty conscience, in connection with crimes she herself committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who had remembered or witnessed an unethical act were more likely to wash their hands than other people, and handwashing was more important to them.
Also, people who had the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing something are less likely to participate in any other cleansing compensatory activities, such as volunteering.
In religions, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic hand washing with water but without soap,  is part of the ritual provided for in many religions, including Baha'i, Hindu, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam mandate that one wash one's hands after going to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash one's hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
The control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 implies the application of methods to ensure labor safety and health protection in order to control the risk and fight against the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Proper workplace risk management depends on the location and task, based on risk assessment, the severity of the epidemic in the community, and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reported that low-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases, basic infection control measures are required, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home when they show signs of illness, observing respiratory etiquette, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Medium-risk positions require frequent or close contact with people who have no confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis but are likely to be infected due to ongoing community outbreaks or international travel.
This may include workers who are in contact with the public, for example in schools, in densely populated workplaces and in some large retail shops.
Risk control measures for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, use of protective screens and affordable personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that medical and morgue personnel who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are at high risk; the risk is increased to very high when such personnel perform procedures that involve the formation of aerosols or the collection/processing of samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19.
Risk control measures appropriate for such staff include the use of engineering and technical safety devices such as negative pressure ventilated rooms, as well as personal protective equipment appropriate to the task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a variety of effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of their own illness, the need to care for others, or the fear of infection.
Commercial patterns can vary both with regard to the types of goods that are in demand and the ways in which such goods are purchased (e.g., making purchases during non-peak periods with delivery or servicing without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be disruptions to the delivery of goods from geographic regions affected by COVID-19. The Epidemic Preparedness and Response Plan can be used to organize protection.
The plans address the risks associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors in the home and community, and individual workers' risk factors such as old age or chronic illness.
The plans also indicate the controls needed to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be guided by national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the goals of providing an epidemic response include reducing the spread of the virus among staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing negative impacts for other organizations in their supply chains.
The response is affected by the severity of the disease in the community where the business is located.
The hierarchy of risk control measures  is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such measures according to their effectiveness.
When the risk of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective are engineering and technical security measures, then administrative measures, and finally, personal protective measures.
Engineering safety means isolating employees from work-related hazards and not relying on worker behaviour, which may be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in work policies or procedures that require action by the employee or employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help to eliminate some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected according to the threat to the worker, fit for purpose (e.g. respirators), be used consistently and appropriately, be checked regularly, maintained and replaced as necessary, and be removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of properly to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) believes that the least risky jobs have the least contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, adherence to respiratory etiquette, including closing the mouth with the hand when coughing and sneezing, provision of napkins and garbage containers, readiness for remote or shift work, if necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of individuals who may be potentially infected  is a critical step to protect employees, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until the heat, lack of fever, and many other symptoms subside for at least 24 hours without the use of heat-lowering agents or other symptom-relieving medications, and also recommends flexibility in hospital policies, allowing employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and ensuring staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, mid-risk jobs require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with people who have no confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection but have a chance of contracting SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of the disease in the community in which the business is located, or due to the person's recent travels to places where COVID-19 is spread.
These include workers who have had contact with the public, such as in schools, high-density work environments, and some large retail stores. Engineering safety measures for such groups and groups at higher risk include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing the intensity of ventilation, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective screens, and installing customer service windows without leaving the car. Administrative measures for such a group and groups at higher risk include recommending sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, establishing hygienic scheduling, stopping travel to the workplace from the spread of COVID-19, including training workers on how to use hand-held protective equipment to protect workers from COVID-19 and other emergency situations, including providing training and training for workers who are at risk of COVID-19 and providing information on the use of hand-held protective equipment to help workers respond to emergency situations, including the use of masks and other tools to protect workers from COVID-19 and the need to provide information on the risks of COVID-19 in the workplace.
In rare cases, workers in this risk group may need to wear respirators.
If a person is sick on board an aircraft, measures such as keeping the sick person at a distance of 6 feet from other people, assigning a crew member to care for the sick person, providing a mask for the sick person, or asking the sick person to cover his or her nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, are required to ensure the proper safety of staff and other passengers.
Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller or when in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, a regular cough or difficulty breathing.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a bio-safe bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. In commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, safety measures include delaying travel in case of illness, self-isolation, and immediately informing the ship's medical center if someone on board is experiencing heat or other symptoms.
Ideally, the medical examination should be done in an isolated cabin for the person. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person has been in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a low or moderate level of infection in the community, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as cancelling outings for face-to-face meetings, gatherings and other mass events such as physical activity or choral singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between the parties, regulating arrival and departure times, limiting nonessential visits, and using a separate location for health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
With significant rates of spread in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, long-term school absence may be considered.For law enforcement officers performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement personnel who are required to contact individuals with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same guidelines as those prescribed for emergency medical services, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during detention, workers should clean and disinfect their belt and equipment before reuse with household cleaning aerosols or by wiping, follow standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and dispose of used personal protective equipment, and use and wash clothing.
OSHA considers certain categories of health care and morgue workers to be at high or very high risk.
High-risk positions include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel who come into contact with patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They are at very high risk of infection when they perform procedures that involve aerosol formation or when they collect/process samples from people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures that are associated with the formation of aerosol include sounding, procedures that cause coughing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures, and examinations or sampling by invasive methods.
High-risk morgue workers include staff who process the bodies of people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if such staff perform an autopsy, they are placed in the very high-risk category. Additional engineering and technical security measures for such risk groups include the use of isolated rooms for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, including procedures involving aerosol formation.
In some health care facilities and morgues, negative pressure ventilation may be an effective measure.
The samples should be handled with the precautions provided for in Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be allocated to segregated waiting zones depending on the presence of suspected COVID-19 infection. Among other personal protective measures, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers interacting up to 6 feet away with patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as persons performing procedures that accompany the formation of aerosols.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved facial respirators with an N95 or higher filter class must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that specifies requirements for individual device selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of special clothing because COVID-19  is a disease transmitted through the respiratory tract, not through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends that only staff performing screening at the point of care use surgical masks.
For those collecting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients or carriers without aerosol-based procedures, WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, goggles or a face shield, a robe and gloves.
When performing procedures that involve the formation of aerosol, an N95 or FFP2 respirator should be worn instead of a surgical mask.
Given the lack of personal protective equipment worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such equipment through the use of distance medicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, ensuring access to a COVID-19 patient only by those who provide immediate care, using only those personal protective equipment that is necessary for a specific task, continuous use of the same respirator without removal when working with multiple patients with the same diagnoses, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and recommending that masks not be used for those without symptoms.

This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a phenomenon that has shed light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We've never had problems like this before, but we know that the effectiveness of our efforts depends on the capacity for empathy, cooperation and community development around the world that underpins this organization.
We saw the friendly and caring relationship between all our colleagues, which was reflected in the emails, calls and chats  a wonderful confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, we have amazing people working with us.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
I was told last week that our work was highly regarded.
I was reminded how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for every person to have online access to this key resource.
And that's because of your work, whether it's keeping the sites running, paying our colleagues, or protecting communities.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia presents, and it's more important today than ever.
At a time like this, to achieve meaningful results for the world, it's not just what we do, but how we do it.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in this process, we will be making important changes to our working arrangements starting next week.
We 're adjusting our work schedule and schedule .
As Robin said earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the days and months ahead.
During the discussion, we discussed our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to take the heat off and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back down, so be it.
For all staff, contractors and freelancers:
We expect to be working about four hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further orders are issued.
We don't announce weekends: if you can work more hours than normal, that's allowed for the purposes of our mission.
But the world is unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether it's caring for your loved ones, buying groceries, or going to the doctor's office, your well-being is our number one priority.
We don't monitor your work hours.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
It's obvious and undeniable, but we're bringing it up.
No sick leave or leave is required: simply inform your manager and help the team review the calendar and schedule to ensure key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, please inform Brian from T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and guidance for your situation.)
The hourly rate will be paid in full.
We have already announced and reaffirm our commitment to our contractors and employees with hourly rates.
Each person will be paid at the usual hourly rate applicable under normal circumstances.
This includes, in particular, periods of illness when you are unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can have amazing results, especially at times like this.
And again, it's about self-help.
We ask that you speak to your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some jobs are considered substantial.
We should always support this kind of activity.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing critical work that may require additional support.
We're initiating a process for all departments to evaluate current objectives and shift focus to providing support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us, and we just focus on the most meaningful projects.
Delay today doesn't mean negative consequences in the future.
We don't plan to work twice as hard to make up for what we've lost after the pandemic is over.
You won't have to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and deadlines where possible.
What 's going on with the APP ?
To adapt to the new reality and expectations of the daily working time, we intend to adjust the timing of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, allowing employees to prioritize critical work, self-help and caring for loved ones, while ensuring everyone who needs or wants to work will have a shorter schedule for the next few weeks.
This extended deadline significantly reduces the ongoing planning burden and stress across the organisation.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week, and we will provide the representatives and teams with up-to-date information on the next steps as soon as we receive the appropriate confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for leading this effort.
Office condition, risks and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, in addition to a number of precautions, we've hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used medical-grade anti-virus solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the reception halls and elevator halls that allow access to our floor.
The building has its own rules, which require that you be cautious, using products that ensure the safety of your tenants.
We feel the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our D.C. office is on the WeWork network, which has shared with us and all staff in D.C. its COVID-19 policies.
Last week, our D.C. office completely switched to remote work, following instructions from San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the rental of a building in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues working remotely know that this can be improved and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings should be limited to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider breaking them into a few days.
Make clear the purpose of the meeting, the agenda, and send out the materials for the briefing in advance.
By default, use video, and for easier interaction and communication, use tools like Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, designate a  person to monitor the incoming questions in the chat and monitor the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for keeping notes (or jointly checking).
If you need a convenient headset, contact the technical support service by e-mail.
Take advantage of your Wellness Reimbursement benefits when you buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying the ergonomics guides available in webinar format to help distribute work efficiently across the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel mass events funded by Wikimedia, such as the Editathons, until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We understand and acknowledge that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the inability to conduct agreed grant activities, and no one will be penalized for unnecessary delays or alterations to such objectives.
Next week we will be hosting follow-up events with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and community conferences.
The overall mood in the global community  is not only sadness over the interruption, but also a sense of relief over the understanding and the opportunity to focus on your own communities, Wikimedia and beyond.
As for the prospects, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide a community space to monitor impact and communicate.
We're keeping in touch on COVID-19 issues.
We're sending you an invitation to a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time we'll take the opportunity to share more relevant information, answer your questions and spend time together, connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we're willing to help in any way we can.
However, you can still get information from such e-mails and other important information about COVID-19  from the Office Wiki.
CRT will update these pages, and all the information will be in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If you have questions about travel, events, key workflows, coverage issues or need any other help, contact the CRT.
We're ready to provide support and communication as needed.
If you have any privacy concerns, please email Brian Judan  Director of HR International Global Operations.
No such change should be seen as a departure from our work and our obligations.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible urgent need for a radically new adaptation of our work and our commitments.
We believe that these steps are necessary to support each other and to ensure that we can continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world with the right service.
Our scheduled work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support each other and create space for the important work ahead in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.
To make that happen, we need the help of each and every one of you, and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work at your best when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 opposes the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), reducing angiotensin-II content and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. AC2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptide domain M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of renal amino acid collectrin.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein type I, its enzymatically active domain is found on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular ACE2 domain is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddaze, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most lung type II alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
ACE2 and RNA biosynthesis is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE counterweight.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into the blood-swelling angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn cleaves the carboxylic end amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, orange, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, binding of the S1 protein of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 splice to the ACE2 enzymatic domain on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme to endosomes located inside the cell.
This entry process also requires priming of the protein S by the TMPRSS2 carrier serine protease, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent. This has led some to suggest that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional associations and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard therapy with APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group.
Moreover, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving APH inhibitors who were at higher risk of developing pneumonia, particularly patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than in patients at general risk of pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory failure syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the 24-hour duration of exposure.
There is some evidence that rhACE2 may be a promising treatment for people with intolerance to classical RAS inhibitors or for conditions in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. Introduced rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile phones designed to assist in epidemiological investigation in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. in identifying persons (contacts) who may have come into contact with an infected person.
In some regions, a number of applications have been developed or offered, officially supported by the authorities.
Several variants of contact tracking applications have been developed.
This has sparked a debate about privacy concerns, especially with regard to those systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
More gentle options in this regard include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join forces to integrate Bluetooth-based support for such apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government has partnered with Alipay to launch an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It's used in over 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has an app called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by local IT companies, is open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-powered StopKorona! app that helps track contacts with potentially infected people and provides prompt communication with health authorities.
The application was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting registration on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that a contact tracking app is in the final stages of development and will be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar apps are planned to launch in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use a geo-zoning app that aims to keep COVID-19 patients living in Moscow from leaving their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Assurance, University of Cambridge, points out a number of potential practical problems that can arise with application-based systems, including false starts and potential inefficiencies if the application is used by only a small fraction of the population.
Given concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious coronavirus applications, Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related apps on the App Store to only official or other trusted organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance of the population through coronavirus-related apps; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappears.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for a limit on this type of surveillance.
The organizations announced eight conditions they set for state projects:
the surveillance must be legal, necessary and proportionate;
the extension of monitoring and observation should be accompanied by a reservation on the limitation of the period of validity;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of fighting the spread of COVID-19.
the security and anonymity of the data must be protected and evidence of such protection must be provided;
digital surveillance should exclude cases of discrimination and marginalization;
any data exchange with third parties should be determined at the level of legislation;
protection from abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse must be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their lists of terms.
Google and Apple are proposing their joint plan to solve the problem of constant surveillance, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from the operating systems of their devices as soon as the need for it is no longer there.
Some countries use network location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download an app and the ability to avoid being tracked.
Network tracking has been approved in Israel.
Network solutions that have access to the original location data also have big potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system was used to track contacts without using an app as a base.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking and card transactions, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected individuals.
The government not only used this information to warn citizens about potential contacts with infected individuals, but also made location information publicly available, made possible by significant changes in information protection legislation that were made after the MERS outbreak in that country.
Access to this information is available through a number of applications and websites. Countries including Germany are considering the use of both centralized systems and systems that preserve confidentiality.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not been made public.
Privacy-preserved contact tracking  is an established concept with a significant amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013.As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-preserving solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user's approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol.Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols for ensuring privacy, mobile contact tracking (PACT) mechanisms, and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all matches are made on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures privacy when collecting and using location or intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on research cited in the document Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic (Apps-Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic), published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform, developed by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company that was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses robust hardware technologies that allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of that data.
On April 5, 2020, a global coalition of groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols, TCN, was founded with the goal of reducing fragmentation and ensuring global compatibility of tracking and alerting applications, which is a key factor in their widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had unlocked the BlueTrace source code used in the work of its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they claimed would provide privacy and is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption to maintain privacy.
They also published technical specifications for the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
deploying tools that allow governments to create official applications to track the movement of coronavirus-infected citizens, but with data privacy
By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve the ongoing surveillance problems by first implementing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way once the threat is gone.
Drug repositioning (also known as re-profiling, re-direction, task re-targeting, or therapeutic drug re-direction)  is the re-profiling of an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or medical condition different from the disease originally intended at development.
This is one of the areas of research currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of reconvalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-responsive proteins, each of which has several ligand-binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites serves as a suitable basis for developing an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, helica, S protein and ADF-ribophosphate.
Hussein AA and co-authors in their preclinical study studied several candidate compounds, which were then optimized and analyzed for their similarity in structure to the most similar approved drugs, to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2 that would be recommended for clinical trials.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chlorohine and its related hydroxychloroquine would be among four drugs being studied in the "Solidarity" clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin in New York State on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
The treatment regimen has not been approved during the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but unable to receive treatment under clinical trial regimens.
CDC stated that the order of use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when there's no other way.
A Turkish research group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorohine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is being done at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU School of Medicine in Langone is studying the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravir is "uniquely effective".
The 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug had a negative result after an average of 4 days, while the 45 patients who did not take the drug had a duration of 11 days.
In Wuhan, a study was conducted that followed 240 patients with pneumonia, half of whom received favipiravir and the other half umifenvir.
The Italian pharmaceutical authority reminded the public that the results that indicate the drug's effectiveness are scarce and should not be considered definitive.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to replenish its stockpile, and use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has informed the Trump administration that the drug may be less effective in cases of the disease.
It may not be safe for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to become pregnant.
One study of the combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir (Caletra) concluded that the efficacy of the drugs had not been established.
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2.
The WHO has included a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international "Solidarity" trial.
Remdecivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences subsequently found that remdecivir has in vitro antiviral activity against a variety of phylloxera, pneumonia, paramyx and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are currently underway, including two at the University of Cleveland Clinics; one is being conducted in patients with a moderate form of the disease, and another  in patients with a more severe form of the disease.
Currently, three clinical trials are underway for intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a severe form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one non-placebo study (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, the trials of the antibiotic azithromycin began in the state of New York.
The Japanese National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical trial of Alvesco (cyclosonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for the treatment of asthma, for use in the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
A Phase II trial, angiotensin-converting enzyme form 2, is being conducted with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria who are hospitalized with severe forms of the disease, to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who had been diagnosed with COVID-19, with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant, breast-feeding women and women who do not use effective contraceptives cannot participate in this study.
In Italy, there are several coagulants undergoing testing.
Low-molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which prompted the Italian Medicines Agency to publish recommendations for the use of this drug.
On April 14, a multicenter study involving 300 patients was announced in Italy to study the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on re-profiling approved antiviral drugs that were developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribovirine: Ribovirine has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines.
Umifenvir: Umifenvir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been found to be potentially suitable for use as a treatment for COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also trials in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine  is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to be available for more than 18 months.
In April , five candidate vaccines passed Phase I safety testing .
The COVID-19 virus was discovered in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the speed, production capacity, scale deployment and global access needed.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development at the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in the Phase I security studies:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and candidate for vaccine: Moderna, and RNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I developer and candidate for vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, 37 candidate vaccines have been announced, but little public information is available on them (presumably in the planning or development stage).
In stages I-II, preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing is conducted, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and in several sites with the simultaneous determination of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group; at this stage, drugs are tested for efficacy in disease prevention and at the same time side effects are monitored at optimal dosages.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines currently in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on humans (all are still in preclinical studies).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it is investigating the potential of a molecular-clamp vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine with the goal of starting human testing in 2021.
The start of the vaccine development projects was also announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies led by Hanneke Schwitmaker announced that they had begun work on their vaccine.

On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into a partnership with Novavax Inc.
To develop and manufacture a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans to conduct preclinical trials and Phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that even in an accelerated mode, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, announced that it had created a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
A potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory testing, with human testing scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac big sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an iRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162 is an iRNA-based vaccine candidate; the drug is currently in preclinical trials, with clinical trials set to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that it would receive preclinical trial results in April 2020, and that their final vaccine candidate drug could begin human testing as early as the autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), France, announced a $4.9 million investment in a consortium to develop a COVID-19 vaccine with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced a $275 million funding of 96 COVID-19 medical countermeasures research projects, including the development of numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago Initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced a $192 million Canadian vaccine development program specifically for COVID-19, and plans to create a national "vaccine bank" that would include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, on mice, stating that MNA was administering subunit SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines, causing strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that manifested 2 weeks after immunization.
On April 16, 2020, the Canadian School of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, which may be released in the form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will multiply inside human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three US universities combined IBM's supercomputer resources with those of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means they may have other benefits besides their disease-preventing properties.
Another randomized study, conducted in Australia, involved 4,170 health care workers.
The vaccines being developed may prove to be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models of COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and lower primates, indicate the need for biosecurity level 3 infection containment measures in live virus handling, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there is no safe and effective vaccine or drug to treat SARS.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat atypical pneumonia has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS began to spread, it was thought that the SARS study that was being conducted at the time could become the standard for developing vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) vaccine against MERS that has passed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were virus-based vector vaccines and were in development, two  adenovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one  MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
A conspiracy theory has been circulating on social media, claiming that the COVID-19 virus is not new at all and that a vaccine for it already exists.
Social media posts cited some patients who claimed patents for the genetic sequences of other coronavirus strains, such as the SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus  is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from the first symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are mild, but in some cases the disease can spread to viral pneumonia and polyorgan failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, with more than 153,000 people having died from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is spread primarily through close contact with each other, often through microscopic droplets released into the air by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although these droplets are formed by exhalation, they usually pose a threat when they hit the ground or the surface, but they are not transmitted through the air over long distances.
People also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surface for 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although its spread may be possible both before symptoms appear and at later stages.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspected illness and for those who care for them.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks vary: some agencies recommend that they not be used at all, some recommend their use, and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
Local spread has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or have symptoms of influenza, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or cramping, confusion, difficulty waking, bruising of the face or lips; if you have any of the above symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, a runny nose, or sore throat, may be less common.
Also, there are different rates of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Some cases reported in China initially showed only a feeling of tightness in the chest and a rapid heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and eventually death.
It's called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people have symptoms within 11.5 days of infection, but according to the available data, not all people with infection have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic vectors in disease transmission is not yet fully understood, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of people infected with asymptomatic course of the disease is currently unknown, and is still being studied; however, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus were asymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in its daily reporting from 1 April; of 166 cases reported that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both saliva and spit can have high concentrations of the virus.
When speaking loudly, more droplets are released into the air than when speaking at a normal volume.
A study in Singapore showed that when coughing openly, droplets can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
The virus is not normally transmitted through the air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transmission of virus particles via bioaerosol is still possible, and testing of air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside people's rooms has shown the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the products of the breath to be sprayed and, therefore, the virus to spread in the air.
There is also concern that the virus may spread through feces, however this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; the virus may spread before symptoms appear, but this risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, but it is known that one person normally infects 2 to 3 other people, and the virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that on cardboard surfaces the virus is able to live for one day, on plastic surfaces (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304)  up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces  up to 4 hours.
These figures, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents, when used correctly, have a very beneficial effect in fighting infection: soap destroys the fat-protecting layer of the virus, thus deactivating it, and can also remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against the virus.
Five of the six patients had the highest concentration of the virus in their blood on the first test, and the sixth patient had the highest concentration of the virus in his blood on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome first detected in three people with pneumonia from the acute respiratory disease group recorded in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which opens its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most vulnerable organ to COVID-19 as the virus enters host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II alveolar lung cells.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell with the help of the characteristic surface glycoprotein  shipa (a dust mixture).
Twelve percent of those hospitalized in Wuhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in severe cases.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders seen during disease progression, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in large numbers in the heart because they are involved in the functioning of the heart.
High rates of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were observed in patients who were in the IUT with COVID-19, and may indicate poor prognosis.Autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism to ACE2-expressing respiratory epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 have been shown to have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-CSF T cells correlate with recruitment of IL-6-secreting inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Autopsy also revealed lymphocytic infiltrates.
WHO has also published several protocols for testing for this disease.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard testing method.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples taken with a nasal swab, but a nasal or sputum swab can also be used.
The results are usually ready within a period of a few hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and their results are not immediately relevant.
Chinese scientists have isolated the coronavirus strain and published its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests that could detect the presence of infection at the current time, as well as the fact of possible infection in the past, were in development but not yet widely distributed.
Chinese experience of studying these test results has shown that their accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, allowing it to be used later this month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital outline methods for detecting infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
The two-sided multi-domain subpleural focuses of the thickening type of the matate glass with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are frequent symptoms detected in the early stages of the disease.
Subpleural dominance, the symptom of the limbic bridge (long-term thickening of the bulkhead with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop with the progression of the disease.
There is little data on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological examination performed at the autopsy:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, thickening and swelling of the lungs
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
mild form of pneumonia: lung swelling, hyperplasia of pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multi-nucleated giant cells
severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: exudate in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravascular clotting (DVS syndrome); leuko-erythroplastic reaction is a common cause of blood clotting.
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequently washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, following respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that you cover your mouth and nose with a napkin when you cough or sneeze, or, if you don't have a napkin, cover your mouth and nose with the inside of your elbow area.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended to have a good hand hygiene.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue face masks in public places, in particular to limit the transmission of infection by persons with asymptomatic disease. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; schools and businesses have been closed, movement of citizens has been restricted, and large public events have been canceled.
Distancing guidelines also require people to be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no medicines with proven efficacy against COVID-19.[citation needed] As vaccine development is not expected to be completed until 2021, the bulk of measures against the spread of COVID-19 are focused on reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as the "plateau exit".
The CDC also recommends washing hands more often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or if you have heavily contaminated hands, and before eating and after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends using an alcohol-containing disinfectant (with an alcohol content of  at least 60%) for hand washing, but only in cases where soap and water are not available.
These compounds use ethanol or isopropanol, which have antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not suitable for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that anyone who suspects they have the virus wear a regular medical mask.
Extramarine oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen the immune system, it is recommended to follow the rules of personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet.
Supportive therapies may be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care physicians and pulmonologists have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in the free resource  IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the treatment of symptoms as first-line medications, some health care professionals recommend choosing paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen.
When performing procedures that may involve air-dropping, such as intubation or hand drying, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission, especially in medical settings.
The CDC recommends that healthcare workers caring for people with COVID-19 be placed in an air-drop isolation (AIIR)  an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective coat, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for use in industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used without instructions, the effectiveness in terms of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends using protective face shields or, as a last resort, making masks yourself at home.
In most cases, the form of the COVID-19 outbreak is not severe enough to require artificial ventilation or its alternatives, but there is a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.
A type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure is currently being actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with either an intensive nasal oxygen cannula or a two-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these two methods is as effective as IUDs for critically ill patients.
Some doctors choose invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs if available, as this method significantly limits the spread of particles in the air compared to a nasal cannula with intense airflow.
Many developed countries lack hospital beds per capita, and health systems are too limited in resources to cope with the dramatic increase in severe cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that five percent of patients were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3 percent needed mechanical ventilation, and 1.4 percent died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The challenge of providing artificial ventilation to the lungs is complicated by the growing problems of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygenation.
Inhalation-supported IVL and PDCV are necessary to deliver maximum oxygen to the lungs and to ensure minimal damage to them by ventilation, which can result in pneumothorax.
On earlier models of fans, high VDP may not be available.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
Remdesivir is the most promising.
The development of new drugs may take until 2021, but some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of the disease.
WHO-recommended volunteers are taking part in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. FDA has granted temporary authorization for the use of recovalent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where human life is in serious or imminent danger.
It has not been subjected to the clinical trials that are required to prove the safety and efficacy of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app designed to combat the outbreak.
Users must enter their name and ID number to log in.
The app can detect "close contact" with surveillance data and therefore determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Big data analytics collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking and artificial intelligence  such tools are used to track infected people and those they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people who are suspected of being infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for individuals who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided the federal government agencies of Germany and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of cell phone subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology was introduced to identify quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner Giulio Gallerà said mobile operators reported that 40% of people still continue to move around the country.
The German government held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon, which attracted more than 42,000 participants.
Estonia's President Kersty Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
People may be stressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic downturn are the perfect conditions for harming people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may be mild with little or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Patients with mild forms of the disease usually recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may take three to six weeks to treat.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, although similar data on COVID-19 are lacking.
In people with the most severe course of COVID-19, it can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
COVID-19 complications include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and heart, kidney, and liver problems.
Thrombogenic abnormalities, especially increased prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while renal impairment was observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 2030% of COVID-19 patients have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were in hospital.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to studies of early cases, the average time from the onset of symptoms to the day of death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8 percent, and among women  1.7 percent.
Postmortem histopathological studies of lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromycoid exudates in both lungs.
There were viral cytopathic changes in the pneumocytes.
The lung looked like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were due to elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had a history of health problems.Access to medical resources and the socioeconomic situation in the region may also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary by condition because of such regional differences, as well as methodological difficulties.
Insufficient lightweight case counting can lead to an increased mortality rate.
However, the fact that deaths are caused by diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 overall, and these patients were about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive treatment or die than nonsmokers.
The administration of one Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who recovered from the disease had a 20 to 30 percent reduction in lung volume, and their scans revealed damage.
After recovery, it can also lead to post-ICU syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether patients recovering from the virus developed a persistent immune response.
Judging by the course of other coronavirus, this is considered likely, but there have also been reports of cases where after recovering from COVID-19 the coronavirus tests still turned out to be positive.
It is believed that these cases were exacerbated by prolonged disease rather than re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural, animal-derived, and an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to its transmission from person to person.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls December 1, 2019 the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is  December 8, 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary by region and time of spread, and are also influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment regimens used, the time since the outbreak began, and population parameters such as age, gender, and general health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the disease the ICB-10 emergency assistance codes: U07.1  for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2  for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of April 17, 2020, the global death and infection rate is 6.9% (153,822/2 240 191).
Some other methods include determining the disease-related mortality ratio (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who died from the disease, and determining the infection-related mortality ratio (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Although not all patients who have been infected produce antibodies, the presence of such antibodies can tell how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castillone d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during the carnival celebrations among young people, causing relatively lower deaths, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, Germany's healthcare system has not been overburdened.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, judging by the donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
The impact of pandemics and mortality rates are different for men and women.
According to studies in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher among men.
The highest risk group  are men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women only narrows after the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender immunological differences, lower smoking rates among women, and concomitant diseases in men (e.g. hypertension, which occurs in men at a younger age than in women) may be the cause of higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not keep gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different gender statistics.
Women make up the majority of healthcare workers, especially nurses, and are therefore more likely to be infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease  COVID-19.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains: CO stands for corona, VI virus, D disease, and 19 is the year when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species, or groups of people, as required by international naming guidelines aimed at preventing stigmatization.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communications, WHO also uses the terms COVID-19 and virus responsible for COVID-19.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the time of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, in accordance with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in disease and virus names, WHO recommended using the terms Acute Respiratory Disease 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease.
On 11 February 2020, the official names  COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published.
Because of the limitations of standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers print medical materials, such as nasal swab pads, and parts of IVL devices.
In one such case, an Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier could not deliver it in time, so one of the local factories was redesigned and was able to print the required 100 valves overnight.
Since the first outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and false information about the virus' origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects have been spreading rapidly on the Internet.
It's possible that humans can infect other animals.
The results of the study did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is currently no approved vaccine against the virus or drugs to treat it.
Various international studies of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs are currently being conducted by governmental organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial, which aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
There is no ready-made vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells via the ACE2 receptor, so the research uses the results of previous studies conducted on SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, the researchers are working on a whole-virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether in an inactive or dead form, is aimed at inducing a rapid immune response in the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, subunit vaccine, is to create a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to specific subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies aim to destroy the S-spike protein, which helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy  is to develop vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA-vaccines, a new method of creating a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies must be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent enhancement has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
The drugs approved for malaria treatment were evaluated in seven trials, four of which were on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reprofiling of antiviral drugs is the bulk of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine Phase III studies on remdesivir had been conducted in several countries.
A dynamic review of clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 has been conducted as of April 2020. Several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also being considered for the same purpose, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with beta interferon.
As of March 2020, preliminary data are available on the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients who received remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already underway in the US, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was reviewed in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The Chinese guidance also lists interferon, ribavirin, or umifenvir as COVID-19 agents in the 7th edition.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for in vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.
Nitasoxanide was recommended for detailed in vivo study, demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that the binding of the spike protein to the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is required for the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on the use of chlorohine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytocinemia may occur as a complication in the late stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties of hypercytokinemia. A small study by the National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in the recommendations for the treatment of coronavirus.
The drug has entered a phase 2 non-randomized trial being conducted nationally in Italy after positive results were obtained in patients with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin testing for cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors thought to be the cause of death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroidal refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients recovering from COVID-19 to people who need them is now considered a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of SARS patients, but the results have been inconclusive.
Neutralization of the virus  is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of recombinant serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against the virus, may be increased.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of syndromes with a high degree of similarity
Li Wenlian, a Wuhan Central Hospital doctor who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after reporting the spread of the virus.
