He misses his mom.
I think, then I exist.
There are no witnesses.
Grandpa has white hair.
Come eat!
We're already married.
I'm finely grinding the chili.
Who's gonna believe us?
I am a woman.

This dog is big.
The situation is worse than we thought.
She talks about you all the time.
Get out of here!
Help!
I want to be alone!
Since when?
How ferocious is this cat!
I'm giving my husband a massage.
Fresh meals look delicious.

I'm tired.
Bus to the airport.
I don't understand what you mean.
There is no.
No way!
There's no time.
I'm a woman.
I'm having toothache.
I don't know anything about his past.
Happy New Year!
Cover, it's cold out there.
I hope I'm happy with you.
Nose is abnormally large.
Get your food ready!

How are mom and dad?
I love you.
My team has never advanced past the quarterfinals.
Have you taken this place yet?
What else could one ask?
The king abuses his power.

This is food.
Go home!
Welcome to Tatoeba!
I like to eat Greek food.
What, you like it?
What is this?
Ice on the left foot.
Come on, get back in the car!
Do you know any martial arts for traveling like this?

Yes, I did.
Let's go!
Happy Independence Day!
Mary is sucking a candy.
Liberate Palestine!
What are you talking about?
Was that funny?
Tom has three children.
Quiet!
Yesterday it was hot.
Do it according to this.
Don't be such a silly fool!
I like this apple, the green one.
I like Korean food.
Follow me.
Leave me alone!
Where are you?
Thank you so much for this dinner.
ICE on the left leg.
Congratulations!
I wish you pure joy.
I'm a college student.
I'm thirsty.
She cried when she heard it.

Get up!
Yesterday it was hot.
Smells rich!
Don't trust too fast!
They're running a fag contest.
She couldn't sleep at all last night.
I can't tell the taste.
He got lost.
I hate liars!
It's quiet here.
Looking at them, they seem to be very hungry.
That's great!
Tom is making bread without flour.
You broke my heart.
How old are you?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I love you.
Get out of here!
You don't think it's funny.
The good medicine gives us a long life. It's sleeping enough, eating healthy, exercising and being compassionate.
You got a beard yet?
The king abused his power.
Tom attended the wedding.
Do you love me?
I'm sorry I was late.
I have a question.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Don't be so quick to think badly of others!
Why?
I like the Kurdish language.
Don't do that again.
That cat's afraid of mice.
Do you want to eat something?
You go to school?
Believe me, I'm not lying!
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Don't whisper!
I'm sorry I didn't come last night.
Alice went to bed at ten.
How do you do this?
You told him he finished work three days ago.
Welcome to the house.
How old are you?
Put it down!

Are you sure?
Listen to me!
I want to eat rice bark.
Oh, I'm glad to hear that news.
He speaks Chinese fluently.
I don't have a ticket.
I don't have any money.
Is this good news?
I can swell for an hour, but if it's more than that, it'll hurt!
I was afraid you'd leave me.
You can put it here.
This was my mistake.
I'm a woman.
The dog bit the man.
Get the food.
Tom went home.
I have a question.
For now, it's nothing.
Tom has a heavy sleep.
Don't worry about it.
I'm going to eat too.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I think Tom is really honest.
I'd like to think I know what I'm talking about.
Welcome to the house.
What do you want?
What country are you from?
Wait a minute!
Where do you need to go?
Hurry up!

Oh, my God, how rich is that hummus!
Thank you very much!
I hardly like him.
Help!
You saw her, didn't you?
Tom is very good-hearted.
My wife has very pretty skin.
I want to buy a phone card.
Yes, we miss the family a lot.
I don't have any money.
What are you doing?
Tom is home.
See you soon!

How are you?
Where are you going now?
Susan likes cats.
This is crazy.
Is that good news?
He's more of a squealer than me.

I'm in a lot of pain.
What time do you go to the cafe?
You're not supposed to eat at work.
Do you need more tamarind?
She has goose hair.
Where are you going?
She's in the kitchen.
I don't know.
This is not funny!
Why is that?
Help!
Have you got time?
I love you!
I'm peeing on my face.
Limon juice is richer than mango juice.
The book is on the table.
The taste is there.
Don't talk behind the backs of others!

They're cooking a meal for us.
Are you sure?
How cute he is!
I've been to Kyoto three times.
She smiled melancholy.
That street is flooded.
He's mad at me.

I'm having breakfast.
I don't know any martial arts.
The driver drives too fast.

He seems angry.
I won't apologize.
I don't have any money.
You're wrong.
Yes, it was a very short time when Hachi and I met.

I'm hungry!
He likes sports.
Do you know if there's a bike and motorcycle repair shop around here?
How about that?
That street is flooded.
I don't speak Japanese.
Have you brushed your teeth yet?
He speaks English fluently.
Elvis Presley is one of the most famous singers.
Let's go!
It's not important.
We watched TV together last night.
I love cats.
That dog is prettier than this one.

I love you!
Hello, my friend!
I have a dictionary.
Welcome to the house.
Lock when you go into the room.
Christ is risen!
Put it down!
Shut up!
I don't have any money.
(Applause)
Don't get mad!
Wait a minute!
I hope I'm happy with you.
I'll be back soon.
Where?
He doesn't understand.
Hello!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I got too full today.
It's not important.
What?
Welcome to the house!
Why are you crying?
If the food is fresh, it will be tasty.
Let me ask you a question.
Grandma is very annoying.
Make a plate of noodles first.
What time do you go to the cafe?
I like Nom Bompong cakes a lot.
My husband likes to exercise.
I don't know.
️Please help us share your knowledge together.
Help me!
No, not at all.
They tried to bury us. They didn't know we were seeds.
Good night.
Listen to me!
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Football is my little brother's hobby.
I'm very sad today.
️Children like ice cream.
Why are you crying?
How painful sunburn is!
They were worried.
I admit it's true.
What is that?
How are you?
How did you feel when you met her?
I have time.
This is food.
Come on, I'll help you.
No, I don't have one.
When we were grabbing her in a cart, her face turned red.
I love sports too.
I was so happy when I heard that Hachi was back.
My wife is the most important.
I want some milk.
I'm tired.
He may have taken the next train.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We're lost!
Get cleaned!
Let me rest first.
You walk faster than me.
I have to sleep.
Have you put gas on the bike yet?
The phone on my desk kept ringing loud.
No way!
actually, yes.
She's been puking all morning.
Where do you live?
Put it down!
I'm not hungry.
How's the taste?
Her little sister likes miniature dogs.
Welcome to the house!
The bird is in the sky.
I don't have much money.
She's wearing a black pants.
Don't bother me.
How are you?
Where do I park my bike?
Yes, I agree.
Don't lie to me!
Where are you?
I got the mushrooms bad.
The light went out in my house.
He'll be here tomorrow.


Do good to those who hate you.
I'm washing pots.
I'm working out.
How is he doing these days?
You should be more careful next time.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
What did she say?
Her eyes are blue.
Where are you staying?
Are you tired?
He speaks French fluently.
Don't say something and then say the opposite.
The book is on the table.
Don't forget to bring it!
Pisey hates dogs.
I have two cats.
You're wrong.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The boy likes to play with cats.
You miss your family a lot.
Where do you need to go?
Where are you going?
I took a class but it seems like real life experience is much more valuable.
What do you call this color?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The baozi of yesterday knew nothing about wealth.
Don't be so presumptuous.
I'm washing clothes.
Can I help you?
Are you sure?
Are you happy?
I still don't know if he's here or not.
I think that's the best way.
Need anything else?
I met my husband by chance.
Where's your house?
You're not my mother.
He assumed he was the prettiest.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Go play baseball!
Where are you from?
He lives in New York.
I'm in a lot of pain.
Leave me alone!
He speaks English fluently.
How much is an onion?
How old are you?
I'm washing my husband's jacket.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

I'm going to give you a big kiss.
Don't miss it!
Stop it!
They're satisfied with the contract.
Why are you calling me?
We don't believe that.
It's over!
What's the matter?
I'm eating my elote rich.
What do you want to eat?
When you're in trouble, ask me for help.
Tom ate the stew straight from the pot.
They were scared.
Are you married?
I'm hungry!
What are you saying?
I punished Tom.
Elephant walking ahead of the others.
Mormons hate coffee and tea.
Get over there.
"Thank you". "Nothing".
Mary is Tom's half-sister.
I'm sitting there watching the moon.
When the big guy wins the kid, he'll get back up and the big guy's gonna run.
Help me, little one, get my shirt off.
How cute she is!
You going?
He eats more breakfast than he eats lunch.
Thank you for coming to our house.
That there won't be a next time.
Go see Tom.
It's a pleasure to meet you too.
How are you?
What are you gonna write about today?
My older brother has a mustache.
I don't have any money.
Help me!
What?

No, I don't have it.
What's his name?
He kept his promise.
I once changed money at a change house down the street.
Listen to me!
Put it down!
Everybody loves sports.
I have a question.
Password is "Muiriel".
Don't be so complicated.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Welcome to the house!
The car turned right.
Get the coffee to the third floor, room number five.
A fly bit me.
It's nothing.
I bathe elephants.
That man already ate your ice cream.

We were sure we'd win the game.
Hurry up!
Put it down!
She's my wife.
Tom can sleep anywhere.
Welcome to Tatoeba!
I wanna go to the bank.
I'm out of energy.
Her hair is short.
Amazing!
She gave birth to a baby girl yesterday.
Your house is big.
Thank you so much for the food.
How old are you now?
Don't let go. Hold on tight.
I see.
Typically typhoons are heading for Japan.
This was my mistake.

The girl is pulling her mom's hair.
Smells rich!
Grandma gets mad real quick.

Are you exhausted?
I don't like wine.
Are you happy?
Tom drinks too much.
How long are you going to be back, Hachi?
I see.
You trusted me?
I don't know.

What do you want to eat?
There is no!
The book is on the table.
Mary is eating atole with chicken.
The teacher teaches private lessons.
The dog woke the pig.
He speaks French fluently.
That dog shit on the road.
Perfect. No shortage of it.
You never have classes or what?!

I was already raining when I got home.
What smells so rich?
This dog is bigger.
Have you ever been on a plane?
She hasn't stopped crying since she spoke on the phone with that boy.

I hate this food.
You want me to get rid of this?
You ever shave onions?
What did you have for dinner tonight?
Can I help you with something?
The king abused his power.
She likes to have fun.
Stop!
You're tired?
Do you know the way?
She didn't stop crying when that boy finished talking to her on the phone.
How do you feel here?
I know a little girl who's always smiling.
Is it cold?
Listen to me!
I'm tired already.
You like shrimp?
They stopped their motorcycles on the road.
You live here?
I don't have a ticket.
Always wear glasses.
I miss you so much and I'm sending you a big hug.
How should discontent be stopped?
Don't worry about it.
Look, they're coming across the water.
I'm always reading that book.

Hello!
I think Tom killed himself.
Can I ask you a few questions?
Happy New Year!
What sport do you play?
I shouldn't have done that.
Yes, he misses his family very much.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

I pissed in my pants.
Why is that?
Change your mother!
Welcome to the house.
Let's go!
The company employs 500 workers.
How about another round?
Have you ever been married?
That girl's walking slowly.
I don't want to go to school.
They set up a tent and slept together.
Then where am I going?
They told me you could help me.
How sour is this fruit!
Her hair is short.
You hungry?

How fast does Mary swim?
What nationality are you?
I pee a lot.
Slow drive, you could get into an accident.
Cats catch mice.
She's looking for a hotel.
We must live in full happiness.
Where did you go today?Oh, I've been to many places.
Where do you work?
That cat is blue.
I got liquor.
I'm eating rice.
Mama doesn't like to exercise.

Have a good trip!
Don't be so presumptuous.
Put it down!
What time does the bank open?
Her hand hurts.
Get me one.
Don't go there.
It's cold.
No way!
Your car is fast.
He's throwing a piercing look at her.
Where's the package?
Happy birthday!
I'd rather learn the Bokator Khmer martial art.
Who's the host at the party today?
Mary drinks a lot of water.
What time is the celebration?
What?
Bye.
The law was amended.
Do you love me?
Have a good trip.
Will there be anyone around here who can fix motorbikes and bikes?

I'd rather eat fried noodles than fried rice.
Cat's eyes are blue.
