Why don't you come to my place?
You don't have to take a cab, I'll take you.
Who are you going to invite?
Has Tom eaten yet?
This is all rice.
Tom is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
You'll see, you'll be all right.
Tom burned everything.
He wasn't in love with me.
You'd better get dressed now.

I hope what you're saying is true.
Tom likes to shop at Kaufland.
She's the one I've always dreamed of.

Not with the woman, not with the man.
I heard a familiar sound.
What can I get you today?

Then give me two more.
I wasn't talking to you.
You need to get a girlfriend.
How do you know so much about me?
Is there an easier way to do this?
Why did you have to steal my lines?

It's hard to translate what we were talking about into practice.
I can't really make a statement about that.

He loved me like no one else.
Tom did this, not that.
I liked the way you talked to him.
