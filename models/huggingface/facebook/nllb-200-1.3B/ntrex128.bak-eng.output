Members of the Welsh Assembly fear they will look like mappet dolls
Some fear the name change to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament), meaning Members of the Welsh Parliament.
This debate arose over plans to change the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the AM assembly, on all political spectators, thought that we might be ridiculed.
One АМ leyborist was concerned about his team being rhymed with Twp and Pwp", he reported.
Outsiders reading Welsh news: twp is a Welsh word meaning pwp, pwp means buck.
The National Welsh and Social Democratic political parties generally say that they are not riza and offer alternative options.
Although the Conservative Wales Party was openly opposed to the name change, the move from the MWP to the Mappets was quick.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is read similarly to the Yorkshire English letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on a bill to change the name, announced: "The decision on how to name the members of the Assembly, of course, is up to the members themselves".
Under the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Assembly of Wales has the right to change its name.
When the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals in June, it became clear that they preferred to call the assembly the Parliament of Wales.
As for the name, the Commission preferred the Members of the Welsh Parliaments, i.e. WMP, but the MWP variant received the most votes during the public consultation.
Members of the Assembly seem to be offering alternative options, but reaching an agreement on this dispute could pose difficulties for Chairwoman Elin Jones, who is expected to present the amended bill within a few weeks.
The reform legislation included the methods of the assembly's work, as well as rules for disqualifying assembly members and structures of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly, after discussing the legislation, will hold the final election on what they should be called.
Macedonians vote on changing the name of their state in referendum
On Sunday, voters will be able to vote for or against the change of the name of the state to the Republic of North Macedonia.
This referendum was due to a long-running dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athenian leadership, however, felt that its northern neighbors could claim their lands because of the state name, and opposed their accession to the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, George Ivanov, opposed the change of the name of the state by questioning the population, saying that he was cold to these votes.
In any case, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, consider that the change of the name of the state is simply a price that allows the country to join the EU and NATO and that is all that can be paid.
The bells of St. Martin's Church were stopped, just like those of Harlem's churches.
"Of all the old people I spoke to, there were historic bars and churches on every corner", said Mr. Adam.
There is nothing here today.
He says that the loss of All is understandable.
He says that "people today communicate in many ways".
They are not the neighborhood hotels that people frequent regularly.
As for the churches, the leaders were concerned that the money purchased from those assets would not last as long as they expected, and that sooner or later they would return to what they had started from.
He added that by building large numbers of houses from churches, it was possible to fill the condominiums with people who were indifferent to other churches or temples.
Most of the people who will be taking condominiums in these buildings will be white, he says,and therefore they will be waiting for the closure of these churches altogether, because it is doubtful that people who have moved into these condominiums are going to such churches.
Both of these churches were built by a union of whites, before Harlem became a black community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The first white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
The Black Peoples' Association had prayed nearby, and they obtained ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was occupied by a black community led by John Howard Johnson, who was also known for leading the boycott of 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, which was opposed to employing black people.
The fire of 1939 caused severe damage to the building, but when Johnson followed the instructions of the Lord and made plans to restore the building, they ordered a carillon.
David Johnson, the son and heir of the late John Johnson, proudly called the carillon of St. Martin's Church the "Bells of the yars".
However, in July, a specialist who played the corillon gave it another name: Cultural treasure and unparalleled historical weapon.
Experts from the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ann, also noted that this was the first carilion in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved into the large carilion of the Riverside Church just 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriwezer said that the carillon in St. Martin's had not been replaced.
During the last few months, a complex situation developed in the Cathedral of St. Martin, where architects and contractors were invited, some by secular church leaders, others by the Episcopal eparchy.
The Riznica  body, which was in charge of the visitors, consisting of the common people  wrote a letter to the Eparchy in July, fearing that it would t try to risk the costs of the Eparchy,  because the architects and contractors sent by the Eparchy had not been hired by them.
Some churchgoers complained that the eparchy was not openly understanding.
A 13-year-old boy catching lobsters in California attacked by shark
Saturday, California began a hunt for lobsters, which reportedly left a 13-year-old boy injured by a shark after being chased by them.
The attack occurred at 7 a.m., near the beach of Bicon in Encinitase.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning, after diving for about half an hour with friends, he heard a child crying for help and they went to help the boy.
Hammel at first thought the boy was excited to catch the lobsters, but later realized that the boy was screaming "I've been bitten!"
They bit me!
As soon as he reached the boy, Hamel noticed that his arm was broken.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: Shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Djayls, a rescue team member, had seen the shark in the area a few weeks earlier, but he said at a briefing for the media that the shark was a safe species.
Djayls noted that the victim had sustained injuries to the upper body.
Officials closed the beaches of Ponto-beach in Echinitsai for 48 hours for security and investigative work.
More than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most of them do not pose a threat to humans, Djayls added.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the British beauty market
Sainsbury's also has a department store in the style of a department store with assistant-specialists, such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
The British beauty market, which has grown to a sudden £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the prices of fashion and household goods are falling, is now looking to open 11 larger beauty salons across the country, and if all goes well, continue with more stores for the next year.
Investments in beauty come in terms of the use of supermarkets' shelves, which used to be used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said they will expand their beauty cosmetics offerings to 3,000 products, including the brands Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing lineups of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be expanded, taking a special section as in the Boots store.
The supermarket also renewed its boutique cosmetics range, most of which consist of vegan cosmetics, as there is a demand for this type of cosmetics among young people.
Apart from that, the perfume seller Fragrance Shop will test the discounts in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in the south London district of Croydon, and the second later this year in Celly Oak, Birmingham.
With the shift from online stores and local 24-hour stores to day-to-day grocery shopping, supermarkets have had to do more to attract customers.
Sainsbury's executive director Mike Kupe said that retail outlets will begin to look more like department stores as supermarkets try to resist the numerous offers and discounts offered by Aldi and Lidl, which sell non-food items.
Sainsbury's set up sales points at Argos, as well as a good location two years earlier, which, he said, increased the revenue from the sale.
The supermarket's previous attempts to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments had been unsuccessful.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's and Boots had tried to do business together, but the relationship broke down when they were unable to share the proceeds from the sale.
The new strategy came three years after Sainsbury's sale of its 281-storey Celisio pharmacy business to the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for £125 million.
It said that the Lloyds chain would add a four-storey expanded range of luxury brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look of our beauty salons to make our customers feel good.
We also invested in staff who could give us special advice.
Our brand range is designed with all the needs of the recipient in mind, and the charming look and convenient location, now we have become the ideal beauty destination, which is against the old sales rules.
After Holly Willowby pulled out of an £11 million deal, Peter Jones "was furious"
After the Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, host Holly Willow, and the 11 million pound lifestyle brand business were "outraged", Willow signed new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willowby has no time for the household clothing and accessories brand Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old morning television host announced on Instagram that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willowby, who was with Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, left the lifestyle brand business at the last minute to begin work on her new contracts with M&S and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was furious when Willaby told him that he was leaving the business on Tuesday during a tense meeting at the headquarters of Marlow, the Backinghamshire business empire, because he had no time left for his new £1.5 million contracts with the Truly brand".
The business, which was similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, could have doubled Willowby's £11 million fortune.
After 37-year-old Willowby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of her holiday homes.
According to the source: "But, of course, Truly  was one of Holly's top priorities.
This was his chance to live comfortably for the next few decades, looking to the long term.
The decision to leave was a shock to everyone.
No one could believe what had happened on Tuesday, because the project was about to begin.
The Marlow headquarters has a full stock of ready-to-sell goods.
Experts believe that the exit of the star of Britain's most profitable Today morning show would mean a loss of millions of dollars for the firm, as investments in everything from men's to clothing could be delayed and delayed in further realization.
And this could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three, Willowby, and her husband, Den Baldwin Jones, were close friends with his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
With Kapp, Willowby co-founded Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The families vacationed together, and Jones Bolduin owned 40% of the shares of the television firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace former host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity, Ent McPartlin.
A source close to Jones said on Thursday evening: "We do not comment on his working relationship".
Talking was difficult, and then we fell in love.
Some would consider the comment "not worthy of the president", and Trump joked that he would be criticized by the media for his positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump laughed in the voice of the news anchor.
I never gave up.
Kim agreed to a second meeting after Trump noted their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations on the abandonment of nuclear weapons were unsuccessful.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yongho, told the heads of state at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the United States had not seen a "reasonable response" to North Korea's initial steps to give up its nuclear weapons.
Instead, he said, the US is still pressing hard with sanctions.
Trump was particularly optimistic in his speech at the rally.
He said that "we have good relations with North Korea".
We were planning to go to war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
And now we have good relations.
According to him, the efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: the suspension of missile tests, the release of the arrested hostages and the return of the remains of the American soldiers to their homeland.
And he kept his strange attitude in his conversation about Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside into this little arena, we have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Earthquake and tsunami devastate Indonesian islands, killing hundreds
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were said to be unnecessary.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 percent of the population in Lombok, the national disaster status has not been declared, which is a necessary condition for the activation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not need international assistance, which has caused some complications", Ms. Sumbueng said.
Meanwhile, Save the Children was assembling a team to go to Pallu, but she was not confident that foreign officials could provide assistance.
The representative of the National Emergency Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that officials are evaluating the need to get help from international organizations in the situation of Palau in Indonesia.
Indonesia was constantly experiencing earthquakes, leaving them unprepared for natural trials.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Acheha, they are not common on the other coastlines.
The lack of warning sirens, even after warnings of a tsunami disaster in Palu, could be the cause of human deaths.
Even in good times, traveling through the many Indonesian islands was difficult.
The disasters have complicated logistics.
A hospital ship sent to treat victims of the earthquake in Lombok was heading for Pallu, but it took at least three days to reach the site of the new tragedy.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's devastated infrastructure a key element of his pre-election campaign, and put money into road and railway works.
However, the lack of funding weakened Mr. Joe's administration, as elections were looming the following year.
Mr. Joco also opposed the violent pressure in Indonesia to convert most Muslims to a conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced from their homes, as Muslim and Christian gangs fought in the streets using machetes, arrows, and other brute weapons.
See: Daniel Starrige from Liverpool tied against Chelsea
Daniel Starriidge scored a goal in the 89th minute of the Premier League game at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday, saving Liverpool from a defeat to Chelsea.
About 30 yards from the gates of Chelsea, when his team was losing 1-0, Starriidge received a pass from Shakir from Herdan.
He took the ball in his fist and hit the ball on the most distant end of the stick.
The ball flew high into the top corner of the gate.
Thus, the ball was thrown into the goal by Kepu, who flew through Arrizабалаг.
"I tried to get into this position and score with the ball, because players like Shaq always play with all their strength, so I tried to give myself more time", Starriidge told Liverpool FC.com.
I saw Kante approaching and I hit the ball without much thought on one touch.
After Belgian star Eden Azar scored a goal in the 25th minute of the game, "Chelsea" led the game 1-0.
The Sky's forward gave a pass to Matteo Kovachich on the ridge, and the Tigers turned in the middle of the field and ran towards Liverpool.
Kovačić made a quick transfer to the middle of the field.
He then made a beautiful pass and led Hazard off the penalty spot.
Hazard, ahead of the defenders, scored a goal on the away stance with a slippery foot through "Liverpool"'s Alison Bekkers.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League against Napoli on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
In London, Chelsea will face VideoTon in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm.
The number of dead in Indonesia due to the tsunami reached 832 people
The death toll from the tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia has reached 832, the emergency agency reported on Sunday morning.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday caused the collapse of various structures, the blast also caused waves of 20 feet, and many people were trapped under the debris, the representative of the agency Purvo Nuгрохо reported at a press conference.
The city of Palou, with a population of over 380 000 people, consists of the remains of a completely destroyed building and construction.
Police arrest 32-year-old man accused of killing woman
The investigation began this morning with the discovery of the body of a woman in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old man was found at 7:55 a.m. with a knife wound in the Grayson-Muse Building, John Street, with a 32-year-old man, who was arrested immediately.
Police are searching for people who have seen or heard something in the area.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but I have a request for all of you in the John Street area of Birkenhead to contact us if you see or hear anything suspicious.
I also ask others, especially taxi drivers, to contact us, as their videographers may contain video recordings that are important for our investigation.
The woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhend, and a police spokesman confirmed that she had been found inside the house.
Friends who thought they knew the woman arrived at the scene of the incident this afternoon to ask where they found her.
The investigation is ongoing, as the police are still in the process of informing the victim's loved ones.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson-Myuz, just tried to break into his home, but police officers did not allow anyone to enter or leave.
When he learned about the incident, he wrote in tongue.
Residents of the building will be able to return to their homes after a few hours, it was reported.
It was also heard that a police officer had reported to one person that the whole district was now considered a crime scene.

Parliament statue of Cromwell becomes last memorial hit of history rewriting attempt
It would be poetically appropriate for his puritan followers to destroy this statue for the destruction of most of the cultural and religious monuments of the Taliban-colored England.
However, the Cromwell Society called Mr. Krick's proposal "a fraud" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
The chairman of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmit, said: "It is not surprising that the figure of Oliver Cromwell, who did not stand at Westminster Palace, was a thorn in the side of the current statue destruction debate.
During the English Civil War, no order was issued to destroy the icons, nor was it made by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell should be sacrificed for the mistakes of his ancestor Thomas of the last century.
The beautiful portrait of Cromwell by Sir William Хэmo Tornikroft reflects the 19th-century view, and is part of the image of a historical figure that many still praise.
Mr. Goldsmit told The Sunday Telegraph: "The personality of Mr. Cromwell was seen by many, more than at present, in the late 19th century as a supporter of the parliament, of external pressure, in his case, of the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate prediction is one of the ongoing historical debates.
The conflict of the mid-17th century undoubtedly marked the further development of our nation, and the person of Cromwell shows one side of this rupture.
His achievements as lord protector are also worthy of praise and perpetuation.
A pig kills a farmer in China
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a southwestern market in China.
The man, known only by the surname Yuань, was found dead with a ruptured artery, blood-stained, near the pigsty in the city's markets of the city of Люпаньшуе, in the province of Guychzhou, the South China Morning Post newspaper reported on Sunday morning.
In Xinjin, a province of China, pig farmers were preparing to vaccinate pigs in their pig farms on May 30, 2005.
On Wednesday, he came to the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his brother found him dead, the door to the neighboring pigsty unlocked.
According to her, inside the palace stood a large male pig with a mouth dyed with blood.
The report said that the 550-pound pig was confirmed by the forensic medical examiner to have killed the farmer.
My cousin had bruised legs and was covered in blood, says   his brother, named by the Guiyang Evening News after the surname U.
Surveillance cameras record that Yuань went to the market every Thursday morning at 4.40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
About an hour later, her body was found.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuань or his twin brother.
The market manager reported to the evening news that the pig had been locked up so that he would not attack anyone else until police officers had gathered evidence at the scene.
It was reported that the family of Yuang was in talks with the market authorities about compensation for death.
Although rare, previous cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig shoved a Welsh farmer into a tractor, and the animal was scared away by his wife.
In 2012, after an Oregon farmer ate one of his pigs, a farmer from Manitoba reported for CBC News that pigs are generally aggressive but the taste of blood has a negative effect on them.
That's just how they play.
They're very curious... they're not going to hurt.
You should give them the respect they deserve, he adds.
The remaining parts of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As expected, the cold waters of the coast of Mexico have reduced the strength of Hurricane Rosa.
However, in the near future, Roza will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, summer time, Rosa reached winds of 85 mph, with a Category 1 hurricane 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, on the Mexican side.
On Sunday, Rose is expected to head north.
Meanwhile, an air hole formed over the Pacific Ocean and moved eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and when the storm reached the Lower California Peninsula on Monday, it began to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwest of the United States.
Some areas of Mexico will see up to 10 inches of rainfall on Monday.
Eventually, tropical moisture will come into contact with the approaching yellow, causing heavy rains that will be widespread in the southwest during these days.
Rainfall from 1 to 4 in some places will cause sudden dangerous flooding, garbage flow and possibly landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will bring rainfall to 2-3 inches per hour in some places, particularly in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, especially much of Arizona, rainfall is expected to be between 2 and 4 inches.
Tropical rains can be a source of sudden flooding if conditions worsen, as the sowing is clear.
It is pointless to walk in the desert during the tropical rains.
Heavy rain can make rivers out of the canyons, and lightning can cause sudden thunderstorms and dust in places.
The approaching storm will bring heavy local rainfall to the Southern California coast.
Rainfall can generally be around half an inch, which will cause very little rubbish flow and slip roads.
During the rainy season, this will be the first rainfall in the region.
The slightly tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday early Monday, and will intensify late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, a sudden temperature change occurs across the entire United States, as the Arctic begins to freeze, while the tropics remain warm.
Temperatures can change abruptly over a short period of time.
A good example of the temperature change was Sunday in the central part of the United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as Saint Louis and De Moyne, Iowa, can reach up to 20 degrees.
The next few days will be a long summer heat wave.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to see a warm early October, extending from the southern plains to some northeastern parts, as widespread as in the 80s.
Tuesday in New York may be 80 degrees, which is 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast is that temperatures in the eastern part of the United States will likely be above average in the first half of October.
Brett Kavano ' s auditions were watched by more than 20 million people
The trial between Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavano and his accuser, Christine Blaysi-Ford, of sexual assault in the 1980s, was watched by more than 20 million people on six television channels on Thursday.
The last minute break of the regular Friday program was a sign of continued political tension: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had made a deal with the FBI to conduct investigations for a week.
At the school disco, while he was drunk, Kavano tried to strip him and Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he knew 100 percent.
In his emotional response, Kawano said that he knew 100 percent that this was not the case.
According to Nielsen, the report had been viewed by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company determines the average viewership for channels such as CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of channels that also showed this were PBS, C-SPAN, the Fox Business Network and others were not initially known.
And the number of viewers viewing from the offices was difficult for Nielsen to determine.
In perspective, the audience size is roughly equal to the number of viewers watching a football playoff match or the awarding of the Oscar prize.
Nielsen said that the channel, which was supported by its presenters, had about 5.69 million viewers during the day of the auditions.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
Even after the hearings, the interest did not cease.
Flayk became a central figure in the Friday drama.
After the team of Republicans published a report about voting for Kavano, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning as he attempted to climb the elevator to the Judicial Committee where the hearings were being held, while protesters were screaming.
He was staring at the floor for several minutes before being scratched on CNN live.
A woman says: "I am standing right in front of you".
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
"Your strength is as many women as your strength", they say to her.
Before the elevator closed, Flayk's office responded and said he would have more to say until the next committee hearings.
Within hours, cable television and radio networks were broadcasting live when the Judicial Committee was to vote in full Senate to remove Kavano's candidacy.
However, Flayk said that voting would be possible only after the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate the following week, something supported by the minority Democratic Party.
Flake was persuaded by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After consulting with Kuns and a few other senators, Flayk made a decision.
Flayk's vote was important because the Republican Party could not elect him without conducting investigations into the Kavano case.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavano's allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing a "political game" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing a "political game" to undermine Britain's future and national development, the Sunday Times wrote in an interview.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, 29 September 2018.
In another interview on the front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, who criticized his Checks plan for Brexit, said that the proposal to create a common customs territory between Britain and the EU was totally ridiculous.
Wade Sims shot: Police arresting Dayton Simpson in death of LSU player
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting Wedd Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the LSU team.
The head of the Baton Rouge police reported that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson had been arrested, convicted of a second-degree felony and sentenced to prison.
Officials posted a video of Sims and Simpson fighting, and police said that Sims had lost his sight.
Police took a visual from the scene of the crime, and found Simpson's DNA, the CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wade.
According to his lawyer, his pledge was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the Coroner's Office of East Baton Rouge County published a preliminary report on the results, which stated that the cause of death was a bullet wound to the head and neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Search Operations Team, the state police's Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the local community for helping find the perpetrators.
Sports director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to local law enforcement for their efforts and efforts to bring about justice.
Sims was only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
In the previous season, during the game, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, coach of the LSU basketball team Will Wedd reported that the team was shocked by his death.
'These things always worry people,' says Wade.
Volcanic ash showered on Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reaches the southern districts of Mexico City.
After the intensification of activity at the crater, which recorded 183 gas and ash eruptions in 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Management warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday.
The center is exposed to numerous sounds and vibrations.
In photos on social media, a thin layer of dust can be seen on car windows in the Hochimiлько district near Mexico City.
After a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in September 2017 struck central Mexico, Geophysicists observed an intensification of volcanic activity in a southeasterly direction 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the capital.
The volcano, named Don Goйо, has been active since 1994.
On the eve of the year of the vote for independence, police officers clash with Catalan separatists
Six people were arrested in Barcelona after a group of radicals protesting for self-determination clashed with the Omon on Saturday, and thousands joined a demonstration to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's secession.
The radical group sprayed the OMON with eggs and powdered paint, which raised clouds of black dust on the crowded streets.
Later that day, police officers began clashes after using roadside detention to arrest the crowd.
For several hours, the pro-independence group shouted: "We don't forget, we don't forgive", while the anti-unionists shouted: "Long live Spain!"
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, local media reported.
The atmosphere of tension in the region, which had set itself the goal of independence, remained high, especially after the referendum held on 1 October, which Madrid declared illegal a year later, but which was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Most voters wanted independence, although the turnout was small, and those who favored withdrawal from Spain boycotted the election in the main.
According to the Catalan government, more than 1,000 people were injured during the last election, which was caused by violent clashes caused by police attempts to stop the election on polling stations.
The independence group camped out on Friday night, in an attempt to prevent a demonstration by supporters of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to go in a different direction.
Narcisse Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was with his wife at the separatist protest, said he no longer believed Catalonia could be independent.
Last year was one of our best moments.
My parents were crying with joy that they could choose, but now we're delayed".
Despite the fall in the small regional elections in December, the Catalan pro-independence parties are trying to continue their tireless work this year, with their most prominent leaders either voluntarily exiled or in detention awaiting a court ruling to declare independence by referendum.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who helped police by recording the protest on his cell phone, said the conflict was started by the politics of the two sides.
"The argument got more intense", he said.
On Saturday, one of nine Catalan leaders, Orioul Yunceras, who has been in detention since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament elections for a second term.
The fact that the candidate of the European elections is a member of the Spanish government, which we have seen, will not allow the continuation of the repressions and regressions of democracy.
London: men arrested for carjacking
In Londonderry, men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after several home runs with a car.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard-Kресенt on Thursday at about 19:30 (summer time).
According to detective inspector Bob Blemming, the gate and the building itself were damaged.
Also, at some point, the car was shot with an arbalest.
Menga's goal helped Livingston win 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal against Livingston secured the team's victory.
The "Rangers" were surprised that Ibrox had sent club manager Steven Gerrard to the second loss in 18 matches.
When Gary Holton's side was on par with Hibernia's for the second time, Dolly Menga's hit came out differently.
Gerrard's team lost and will face the leading team of the Premier League this season on the following Sunday, the Harts, who are eight points behind.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted the Vienna Rapids in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended his undefeated series in his division to sixth, with head coach Holt still feeling the loss after replacing Kenny Myler last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity against the guests.
Holt's team, with a difficult turnaround in the Rangers, felt that they should be ahead before they even started scoring.
Scott Robinson managed to pass, but his persistence at the gate was exhausted, and Alan Litgow tried his luck, but the ball failed to hit Craig Hэлketts head.
The owners allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they might disturb the guests during the game.
That was the goal.
With the "Reiners" passing the ball from the penalty spot, Livingston opened the score, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson united against Menga, who had hit the penalty spot.
By this time the Rangers were leading, but decided not to break through the owners' defence, with goalkeeper Liam Kelly being highly calm.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos kept Kelly in check.
Scott Pittman was stumped at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Litgow hit the ball from second place in Livingston.
Thus, the attack continued against the Livingston goal, but was unsuccessful, while Halkett was rejected after being called in for the replacement of Glenn Middleton and asking for two penalties for touching the ball.
Fenoменаal result from Livingston
You were with Alasder Lamont at the Tony Makaroni Arena, BBC Scotland.
A phenomenal effort and result for Livingston.
These guys played very well, only surpassing the expectations on the upper trajectory.
Their style of play and staff have not changed since their rise to the top, but they should be grateful to Holt for bringing the team up to speed.
He has so many heroes.
While Captain Halkett led a well-organized defense, Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell in tension.
However, the Rangers were not impressed.
As good as they played in Gerard's time, they were not up to these standards.
Their last ball, which was only once on the home field, should be a sign for the "Rangers" who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a double-cross in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) under the blue sky, the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin with a smile.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, which was held to restore relations with NATO ally Germany.
They had been involved in a dispute over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Later, Erdoğan travelled to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
For many Turks living outside Turkey, it is like a second home.
The police, citing security concerns, blocked the crowd of 25,000 people gathered in front of the mosque, but many were able to get closer and see their own delegates.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, also criticized Erdogan's political work and the German government's decision to recall him to their countries.
A two-way split emerged: some German Turks greeted Erdogan as heero, while others dismissed him as dictator.
Road accident in Detford: cyclist killed after being hit by car
In London, a cyclist died after being hit by a car.
The accident occurred at 10:15 p.m. local time, southeast of the city, at the intersection of the busiest streets in Detroit, Beствуd and Evelin.
The driver of the car behind the wheel stopped, medical personnel arrived, but the young man died on the scene.
The accident occurred about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday, a few months after another cyclist died in a collision on Childers Street.
The city police are working on identification of the man, and they are informed that the next of kin will be notified.
Currently, motorists are advised to avoid this area, as the roads are blocked and the buses are overcrowded.
Long-Lartin prison: six officers wounded in clashes
In the strict regime men's prison, six staff members were injured in the clashes, the prison administration reported.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin in Worcestershire on Sunday, 09:30 CET and continued into the evening.
To quell the unrest, which involved eight prisoners, special Tornado officers had to be called in.
On the scene, the officers suffered minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Special trained prison guards were dispatched to the scene to stop the ongoing clashes in Long Lartin.
Six workers were injured.
We don't want to tolerate such clashes in our prisons, we hand over the guilty to the police, and of course they can spend more time behind bars.
The Long Larkin prison holds more than 500 inmates, some of whom are the country's most notorious criminals.
In June, after the prisoner's attack, the prison director was reported to have been rushed to the hospital.
In October last year, during serious riots, prisoners attacked with billiard balls, and the Omon was called to the prison to solve this incident.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (those areas that are prone to drought may benefit)
Tropical rainfall is rare in Arizona, but it is likely to occur next week, as the remaining energy from the storm Rosa heads southwest along the desert, causing sudden flooding.
National meteorological officials issued flash flood warnings for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City on Monday and Tuesday.
It is expected to arrive Monday evening with rain, and on Tuesday Rose will once again pass through Phoenix.
Phoenix National Meteorological Service officials noted in their report that since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have received the status of tropical storm or disaster.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) struck 40 miles from the Asian border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation of 2 to 4 inches, with up to 6 inches in the isolated Mogollon Oblast of Arizona.
In the vicinity of rocky mountains and large basins, it will probably fall 1-2 inches, eventually reaching up to 4 inches along with its isolated sites.
For areas that are not affected by sudden flooding, the Rosebud can be seen as a blessing, as the region is prone to drought.
Although flooding is a complex problem, some rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as drought is currently observed in the southwest.
According to US monitoring data, at least 40% of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, a second-category drought, weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa lies along the coast of the Lower California Peninsula in Mexico.
Sunday morning, still hurricane-force, Rose was 385 miles south of Point Eugenia, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and moving north at 12 mph.
The storm will lose its strength as it encounters the colder waters of the Pacific.
Thus, it is expected to make landfall on the Mexican coast in the afternoon or Monday evening, with the force of a tropical storm.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rainfall and flooding are possible.
From Lower California to northwestern Sonora, 3-6 inches or even 10 inches of rain is expected, weather.com reported.
The storm will move north through Mexico as a tropical storm, turning into a tropical depression before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, and heading south from Arizona to Utah on Tuesday evening.
The National Hurricane Center reports that the main threat from Rosa is extremely heavy rainfall in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States.
These rains are expected to cause sudden flooding, waste streams in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas, which pose a threat to safety.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
After a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager, who was wounded, was found in the Excelsior-Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton around 04:00 on Saturday, summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition is stable.
The police of Эйвон and Somerset reported that a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Rэдсток area during the night.
Police officers, who explained what had happened, asked all those who had any recordings on their cell phones to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh is angry at Democratic Party "viciousness"
"We must reject the brutal and ugly tactics of the Democratic Party, so vote for Judge Kavano", Trump said in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been angry at the Democratic Party's "viciousness" since he first ran for office.
Kavanaugh responded to Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying allegations that he raped Christine Blasi Ford a decade or so ago when they were young.
During the hearing, Ford also delivered his remarks.
On Saturday, the President said that the American people saw the extraordinary qualities and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"Voting for Judge Kavano was a vote for the candidate of the brightest legal mind of our time, a lawyer who has served the state ideally", he told the pro-West Virginia crowd.
The president, while referring to the importance of the participation of members of the republican party in the elections, also omitted the mention of the candidacy of Kavano.
It's five weeks until one of the most important elections of your life.
I have no part in this, I just tell you.
That's why I fight for good candidates everywhere.
Trump added that Democrats are on a "stand-up" mission.
The first significant vote in the Senate on Kavano's candidacy, as far as we know, should not be later than Friday, the senior aide to the Republican Party leader told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, increasing the number of victims
Authorities reported that at least 384 people died after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday, most of them carried away by huge waves.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach of the city of Palo on Friday, when waves of up to six metres (18 ft) in height brutally washed ashore in the darkness of the night, destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami began after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on the beach helping with their work and died when they did not immediately flee the area, said Purvo Nuгрохо, a representative of the Indonesian agency that helps with the consequences of the disasters, at a briefing in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it followed cars, trees, houses, and so on, said Nuгрохо, adding that the tsunami first came at 800 km/h (497 mph) on the high seas before hitting the shore.
Some people escaped the tsunami by climbing trees, and that is why they survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Palo.
Aerial photos taken by the Emergency Situations Agency show the majority of the destroyed buildings, commercial buildings, bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The earthquakes also hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The area with a population of 2.4 million was also affected by the continuing earthquakes.
The Indonesian Assessment and Technology Utilization Agency (BPPT) estimates that the energy output from the Friday earthquake is about 200 times greater than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city, due to its location in a long, narrow bay, was reported to have been able to intensify the tsunami even further.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive", and reported that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shops, and hotels were destroyed.
He added that some victims were found under parts of the buildings that had been shaken, 540 people suffered various injuries, and 29 people were missing.
According to Nugroho, damage could be greater about 300 km (190 mi) north of Paulun, in the area named Donggala, near the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to Nugroho, the connection with the city of Dongala was completely broken.
It has a population of 300,000 people, the Red Cross reported, adding that their volunteers and workers have also travelled to the affected areas.
"It's already bad, but it's going to get worse", he says.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting the tsunami to Palau, but officials responded that the waves came along with the announcement of a warning.
In a video posted by witnesses on social networks, a man from the upper floor is heard yelling about the tsunami threat to the people in the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water slammed into the shore, sweeping away cars and buildings.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages, which cut off communications around Palau, and caused difficulties for the authorities in coordinating relief efforts.
Authorities reported that they had begun sending military cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city airport was opened only for emergency assistance, and it was closed again until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palo on Sunday.
The victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceeded 800
This is very bad.
World Vision staff from Donegal reported that they passed by the paintings of emptiness before safely reaching the breeze shelters inside their office gate in Palouse.
"They told me that they saw many ruined houses", he says.
This is very bad.
Even after the relief groups began the relief process during the disaster, some were concerned that foreign workers with extensive experience were not allowed to enter the territory of Palau.
According to Indonesian rules, foreign financial, food, and personnel assistance is only available when a disaster is declared to be national.
No such announcement has yet been made.
The problem is still only at the provincial level  said Aulia Arriana, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government declares the disaster to be national, we can apply for international help, which is not yet the case.
When the night after the earthquake and tsunami, which was believed to be a Friday, arrived, the friends and belongings of the missing were believed to be miraculously found by their loved ones during the disaster.
On Saturday, the little boy was dragged out of the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman buried under the rubble, who had been crouching with her mother's dead body for two days.
Gendon Subandino, the coach of the Indonesian national group in paraplanerism, trained the two missing paraplaners for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who had been decorated with the veil in the hotel Roa-Roa, as well as Mr. Mandagi, were his pupils.
"As the oldest person in paraplanerism, I have my own emotional burden", he says.
According to Mr. Gendon, after the destruction of the Roa-Roa hotel became known to the paraplaner organization, he sent a few hours of SMSs to the participants of the beach festival competition in Palo on WhatsApp.
However, his SMS messages were marked only by one gray letter, not by two blue ones.
I think the SMS didn't arrive,  says .
Bank-money machines at the Neuyport amusement complex on the dam 26 750$ bucks
On Friday morning, the burglars stole $26,750 from a Brinks worker while filling out a Newport ATM in Damba, according to the Newport Police Department.
The employee was about to take money from the ATM at the entertainment complex and transport it to the next location, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
But while he was not, a man ran behind the bank clerk and stole the bag, which was meant to be carried, along with the money.
Witnesses saw a few suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not record the exact number of perpetrators linked to this situation in the release.
Anyone with information about the perpetrators is invited to contact the Newport Police on mobile phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper changed his name to Ye.
He announced this on Saturday on Twitter, writing: "The creature known as Kanyé West".
The 41-year-old rapper was known for a time under the moniker Ye, and even his eighth album, released in June, was named after Ye.
The changes were due to Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he said his new album, Yandhi, was expected to be released.
The show's director said that she will replace singer Ariana Grande, who refused to perform for emotional reasons.
Although this is an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word also has a religious meaning for West.
I think Ye is the most common word in the Bible, meaning hinn, which is why West mentioned the album's title earlier in the year in a conversation with his radio host Big Boy.
So I'm him, you're me, he's us, this is us.
He moved from one to you, a name that included our goodness, our complexity, in all - that simple Ye.
Who we are is reflected in the album.
He is one of the most famous rappers, having changed his name.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
Western collaboracionist JAY-Z also spells his name in various strokes or without strokes, or in capital letters.
Mexican leader promises not to use military force against civilians
The newly elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, pledged not to use military forces against civilians, in connection with the upcoming 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre of students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador pledged on the Plaza de las Tres Culturas (Tlatelolco Plaza) that he would never use military force against oppression directed at the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration on the square, military forces opened fire on students and killed about 300 people, a movement that was typical of all Latin America at the time.
López Obrador promised to help young Mexicans, to give them monthly subsidies for their studies, to open more public universities with free tuition.
According to him, youths joined criminal organizations because of unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
The US is doubling its funding for artificial intelligence
After China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the funding of research in this area, said Kai-Fu Li, an investor and AI expert at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after parts of the U.S. government reported on AI, despite the fact that the U.S. had no formal AI development strategy.
Meanwhile, China has revealed its second-year plan: it aims to take the No. 1 spot in innovation by 2030.
"Given that the rest of the world is far behind the U.S., it would be good to double the budget for research on AI, we are looking for further breakthroughs in AI", Li said.
The doubling of financial support for the next major opening of the JI also increases the potential for development in the US, Li said in an interview for CNBC.
His own book, JAI Superpowers: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houtón Mifflin Harcourt, and Lee is the general director of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in China's most well-known JAI, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked on AI systems at Carnegie Mellon University, setting the highest records in the American Otello game, and later became executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee knew of previous technological contests in the United States, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge on robotics, and asked when the next one would be held to help find the next winner.
U.S. researchers have to work hard to get government grants, Li said.
 The academic leaders are not taken by China, but by corporations, says Li.
In recent times, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired the brightest minds from universities to work on AI.
Li said that changes in immigration policy would also help the United States strengthen its position in the field of immigration.
"I think green cards should be automatically presented to doctors of science in the field of AI", he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese government Council presented its second-generation development plan for AI.
Like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations that distribute funds to American researchers, the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides financial support to people in academic institutions, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense created a joint artificial intelligence center, which includes partners in industry and science, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it has invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over 100 million in research in the field of AI.
He did not show any work for about a month or so since he wanted to form his commission.
Macedonians vote in referendum to decide whether to change their country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday to determine whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would help resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece over Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes that its northern neighbors can claim their lands because of the state's name, and is opposed to their joining the EU and NATO.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on a new name proposal, but nationalist opponents felt that the changes would have a devastating impact on the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population, which is predominantly Slavic.
President George Ivanov, after announcing that he would not vote in the referendum, expressed doubts that the turnout of the boycott campaign could be 50 percent for the referendum to become a reality.
The bulletin asked the following question: "Do you agree to join NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that the change of the name of the state is simply a price that allows Macedonia to join the EU and NATO and pay for it after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of my country, for the young people of Macedonia to live freely under the wing of the European Union, because this promises a safe life for all of us", said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievski from Skopje.
Although the referendum did not necessarily have legal force, many parliamentarians said that the election was decided with the results in mind.
Two-thirds of the parliamentary vote is needed to change the name.
The governmental election commission said that as of 1 p.m. there were no violations.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, as it was reported that at the last parliamentary elections in 2016, 66 percent of voters registered and 34 voted.
"I came to vote for my children because our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Yoze Tanevsky from Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško vote in a referendum to change the name of Macedonia, which allows for NATO and European Union membership, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament building, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, preparing a small stage, chairs for the organizers of the boycott of the referendum.
"We are on the side of NATO and the EU, but we want to be on the same level, with our heads held high", Kavadarkov said.
Our country is poor, but we have a conscience.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, like China and Russia, and be part of the Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where unemployment is 20 percent.
"I think that the majority will agree, because 80 percent of our people support joining the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He says that the result of the "yes" is proof that our light is coming.
A poll conducted by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research on Monday showed that 30-43 percent of voters turned out for the referendum, less than the required number.
A poll conducted by Macedonian TV channel Telma TV revealed that 57 percent of voters were planning to go to the polls on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for эйе.
To be successful, the referendum must have a turnout of 50 percent and one vote.
The failure of the referendum would have been the first serious test for a government of Western policy since it came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero, trying to score, goes through the whole defence of Brighton
Serhio Aguero and Raheem Sterling head into Brighton's defence zone after defeating Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
In the 65th minute, Aguero made his maneuvers very easily.
The Argentine attacker received a pass early in the series in the middle of the field.
He ran past three of Brighton's defenders before leaving the open space.
Then four green robes surrounded Aguero.
He passed one guard and several others on the edge of the Brighton stables.
He then found Sterling and gave him a pass to the back of the net.
Taking advantage of the English forward's penalty for a touch, he returned the ball to Aguero, who had already used his right-handed boots to play the Brighton defender, and hit the right side of the net, scoring a goal for Matthew Ryan.
According to Manchester City coach Pep Gvardio, the Aguero is currently suffering from foot pain.
We had arranged for him to come out for 55 or 60 minutes.
And that is exactly what happened.
The footballer was very happy to score a goal.
However, thanks to the Sterling footballer, in particular, the Sky Blues took the lead in the Premier League clash.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball at the bottom of the Brighton team's territory.
And Leroy sent a very good pass to the footballer Sane from the back of the side flank.
Before taking Sterling to the remote stake, Sane had devised a few clever tricks.
The forward of Sky Blus sent the ball into the goal of the opposing team just before leaving the football field.
The next group match of the Champions League against Manchester City will be held on Tuesday at 12:55 pm at the Rhein-Nekkar-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against Rokiz
After the Washington Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no need for a new team.
But Scherzer, who has always been competitive, hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies next Sunday; he has one condition, though - the Rockies should still have a chance to make the playoffs, as they are currently one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in New Zealand's West Division.
In any case, the Roquiz won the title by defeating Nэшнлс last Friday by 5-2, but they are still trying to consolidate this victory in the first division.
"Although we played for nothing, I will probably be able to experience the atmosphere of Denver with the football fans and other teams, and perhaps the game held at the highest level this year.
Is there any reason why I should not participate?
Despite the fact that the Nationals announced the squad for Sunday's game, it was reported that in this regard they decided to allow Scherzer to participate.
Scherzer, who will be 34th in the new lineup, will leave the bench for the reserve game on Thursday and will go on the field as usual on Sunday.
This season, the Washington team has a 18-7 record, a 2.53 goals-against average, and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Anti-Trump rally in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the participation of the Republican Party in the upcoming elections, the President also omitted the Supreme Court-appointed judge Brett Kavano.
Everything that is done in our name may be put at risk in November.
We are only five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is a very important event - I am not voting, but I must try not to get it - so I am actively fighting for worthy candidates.
And Trump continued: "You can see for yourself how evil the radical party Democrats are.
They are determined to use any means to regain power - to chaos and to ruin.
They don't think about hurting people at all - because they don't care - they only think about power and control, but we're not going to give it to them.
The President said that the Democrats were carrying out a "mission of resistance and obstruction".
Trump says that "you've been doing this for the last four days" and calls Democrats evil, dangerous, unreliable and unreliable.
With these words, he addressed the Senate Committee on Judicial Affairs, and named Democratic-Senator Diane Feinstein, which caused a public outcry.
Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
What?
No, no, I was just expecting one thing- a very shameful hand gesture - this is the worst behavior I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer accepted the bar.
People who like to express their opinions are not tolerated there
I was not surprised that activists of my political organization opposed me.
Finally, I am the last member of the Labour Party in parliament among those who are unhappy that we have spoken our minds out.
My colleague Joan Ryan suffered similar mistreatment for her resolute opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of no confidence was criticized for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
According to a joke by fate, Jeremy had expressed similar disagreements with previous party leaders about the importance of economic policy in Europe and national security.
"We want our meetings to be open and efficient for all", said the statement about the Labourers of East Nottingham meeting on Friday.
As a member of the Labour Party's parliament for almost 8 years, General Conferences held on Fridays have been like that.
Unfortunately, nowadays the meetings are not held in a positive mood, and the politics that gave the white hopes are long forgotten, even hard to remember.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not allow for diversity of opinion, that it only evaluates the opinion of each individual in the conditions that are convenient for the party.
It started when Jeremy was still the leader of the party, because those who worked with me (before, I think, we had similar political views) were expecting some drastic changes from me, some of which I didn't agree with at all - it was, at least, national security or the single market of the European Union.
Every time I speak in public - it doesn't matter what I say - then I get mocked in social networks about allowing elections, questioning politics, even saying that you shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
Again, this is not my only experience.
Instead, some of my colleagues were not much help in this regard, because many of the comments made to me were of a political nature, so I know my own arrogance.
I am proud of my very professional and courageous colleagues who never give up despite daily various insults.
One of the biggest dissatisfactions of this political measure is the normalization of such extremely cruel treatment.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn spoke of the need to develop a culture of tolerance within the Labour Party.
In fact, our party no longer opens its doors to everyone - it always dissolves whenever it expresses dissatisfaction or opens its mouth about changing the electoral system.
For the past two years, I've been told by many people that if you keep your mouth shut, no one will hurt you.
But I did not enter politics for him.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, prompted by the disgraceful Thatcher government - which almost destroyed my class at the public school I attended; I tried to provide and preserve better public services for people of all kinds - whether they were ordinary local people or government ministers.
I have never hidden my past politics.
So far no one in East Nottingham has interfered with my political disagreements with the current government.
I have only one thing to say to the leader of the Friday meeting: I am not obliged to waste my time and energy and loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the whole country is against Brexit, because it is clear that Brexit will cause great harm to the house, to various organizations and to public employees.
But I want to say the only real thing, not to the Momentum of Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether there are Labourers among them or not: It is a great pride for me to serve you, and I promise you that even the annulment of elections, in political disregard, will do me no harm than to emphasize the importance of protecting your interests.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for East Nottingham
Er United beat Melrouz 38:17: The undefeated Er team climbs the rankings
Perhaps the last two attempts will change the final result slightly in the opposite direction, but, without a doubt, the main triumph in the Tennant Premier-League will be the team of Er after today's spectacular match.
They are now at the top of the standings, a team that has never lost a match among ten competitors.
They showed remarkable defense at the end of the game and, thanks to this, managed to take control of the football field, so coach Peter Mürchi had every right to agree.
"We may have to endure such difficult games, but we don't give up, so how can we not be happy about that?" - said the coach.
We repeat the words of Melrose player Robin Christie: Applause to Er United, they played this game better than us.
In the 14th minute, Fraser Climó continued Grant Andersons goal attempt, which gave the Ers the lead, but a yellow card was issued to Rory Hughes, a player for the Worriorz of the Scottish national team - which allowed the Melroses to tie the score and Jason Baggot to complete the attempt.
At first, Climó led the Ers with a penalty, and after scoring just before the break, he only made the score 17:5 in favour of the Er team.
However, the Melrouz team started the second half of the game successfully and brought the attempt of Patrick Andersson to reality, reducing the difference to 5 points.
Ruiari then suffered a serious injury at the Not, which caused the game to be delayed for a long time - the player had to be dismissed; when the game resumed, Staffford MacDouall and Climot attempted to push the team further forward.
The team captain, Blair MacPherson, was issued a yellow card and Melrooz did not allow another player to receive the ball because of Bruce Colvin, who was under particularly strong pressure at the end of the game.
The owners of the field returned, but Sturgeon was given a yellow card for snatching the ball from Klimmo on the line of the penalty area, and MacPherson was behind the players of Er.
Just as at the start of the period, Climó again sent a penalty and after Kyle Row caught David Armstrong's ball, he overtook attacker Gregor Henry to work the fifth period on the home team side.
Star of the "All-Star Game" ends his career in the restaurant industry
It was revealed that the star of the "Hamman Game" Ford Kirnan was rumored to be moving into the hospitality industry after being appointed head of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Ford played Jack Jarvis on the BBC, in a famous collaboration with his longtime collaborator Gregory Hemfill, and also wrote the script.
Together they announced that the next release would be the last of the ninth series, and it was determined that Kirnan had planned his fate after Craiglang.
According to official statements, he was currently the head of the company Aдрифтморн Лимитед.
The actor refused to answer questions about this, but the source of the Scottish San newspaper indicated that Kirnan wanted to participate in the "flourishing restaurant trade" in Glasgow.
Our Sea: Bolivia , which has no access to the Pacific, hopes to regain access to the sea
The sailors currently patrol the naval headquarters in La Pas.
The blue flag of the sea is waved in public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River, the military-naval bases even have their own enclosure: The sea is considered our own by right.
It is our main duty to return it.
In Bolivia, which had no access to the sea, the entire country still had its coastline and its desire to cross the Pacific, and in the bloody disputes over resources in the 19th century, the waterway passed to the Republic of Chile.
The Bolivian Inter-American Court held a five-year investigation on October 1, the most hopeful in the last decade.
"Our country has the drive, the unity and the patience, so of course we expect the result only with a positive attitude", said Bolivian Ambassador Roberto Kalsadilla.
After years of disorderly negotiations, Chile must consider the issue of an independent seaport, which will be confirmed by the international court in The Hague and watched with hope by all Bolivians through blue screens.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's most influential indigenous president, is also facing a controversial re-election next year - a decision that is heavily tied to Monday's court ruling.
In August, he vowed that "we will soon regain the Pacific Ocean".
But some analysts believe that the verdict of the court will not be in favor of Bolivia - although not much will change.
The United Nations, which is based in the Netherlands, has no right to intervene on the territory of the Republic of Chile, so the next round of talks cannot be decided.
Pas Sarate, a Chilean international law expert, commented on this position: "The fact that the decision of the International Court was issued only six months after the last hearing shows that this action was not very difficult".
So the last four years have not been in Bolivia's favor.
Saraete said that the issue of opening the sea was captured by the administration of present-day Bolivia.
He felt that the belligerent rhetoric of President Morales had destroyed the last remaining goodwill of Chile.
Negotiations between Bolivia and Chile will continue, but it will be very difficult to conduct them after this.
The two countries have not held ambassadorial meetings since 1962.
The former president of Bolivia and representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Velze, rejected the notion that the court was not too difficult.
He said Monday that it would be a great opportunity for the Bolivian people to build a new relationship with Chile and a mutually beneficial opportunity to end the 139-year-old dispute.
One of Latin America's most famous presidents, Morales, was criticized for his political use of the sea issue.
He said that Bolivia would never give up fighting for the right to access the sea.
"Judgment is an opportunity for us to forget the past.
North Korea: Don ' t wait for nuclear disarmament without trusting the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that the Korean people will never give up nuclear weapons until they show confidence in Washington.
The minister made the remarks on Sunday at the United Nations General Assembly.
And the United States asked to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit.
The minister's comments surprised the U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo, who appeared ready to resume a stalled nuclear diplomacy after a meeting with North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un in Singapore three months ago.
With the ongoing sanctions and the unwillingness to accept the demands of the United States to end the war in Korea, the North Korean war will be a pipe dream.
If Pyongyang were to avoid agreeing to the Washington Declaration without taking the first significant disarmament steps, the United States would be in danger of being forced to accept the newly signed declaration.
Both Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump expressed interest in holding a second summit.
But it is hard to believe that Korea will give up its weapons anytime soon, as this is the only guarantee of security for the country.
To prepare for a summit for Kim and Trump, Pompeo made plans to travel to Pyongyang the following month.
The last collection of massive headdresses presented at the Paris fashion show is on its way to your city ' s central boutique
If you are looking for a new headgear or if you like to completely cover yourself from the sun - look no further.
On the podium, the designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented a surprisingly elegant line of headwear from their SS19 collection and stunned the entire Paris fashion week.
This summer, the uncomfortable hats filled the entire Instagram network and the designers sent these dangerous messages across the podium.
Valentino's hat, a light brown color, with its large wings covering the heads of the models, proved to be a class distinction.
Other major accessories include watermelon, pineapple-decorated, sorcerer's hat-like items - but they won't keep your head warm.
Tom Brown showed it in his clever masks - just in time for Halloween.
Even lips were sewn on the colorful masks - in horror movies, what is called "high fashion" is not spoken of.
One was a synthetic diving kit with a spoon and glasses, and the other was like a container of melted ice cream.
If you are a high fashion fan, it's time to cheer.
Those who know will soon be very close to your home.
The large-sized hats are a replica of the collection of La Bomb - straw-lined, almost one-meter-wide items with edges ranging from the singer Riana to the model of Emily Ratakovski.
The famous sign, which was created by the uncomfortable hat, quickly spread on social networks; after them, the older size of the mucksaws made of straw went to the podium, so large that the model in the swimsuit that lifted it was not visible.
A reddish-yellow mucksack made of burnt-out raphy cloth, with a raphy-stitched strap and white leather handle on the edges - Жакема La Riviera SS19 was the highlight of the Paris Fashion Week collection.
Well-known stylist Luke Armitage said: I'm looking forward to seeing big-size muffins in stores next summer, because the designers have made such a big impact, and sellers will feel the demand for older items.
Head of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland, John Edward: Language education is a must for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland are very supportive of academic achievement, so the results of single and mass student exams for sports, culture, music and other public initiatives have been excellent in 2018.
The Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) is committed to providing the best possible service to pupils and their parents, with over 30,000 pupils currently attending schools across Scotland.
The main task of independent schools is to prepare students for the next higher education, to choose a career path and to find their place in this world.
As an education system that develops and implements its program individually, we are building a popular and necessary modern language lessons.
Nelson Mandela, former president of South Africa, said, "If you talk to someone who has learned a language, you are speaking to their brain.
When you speak to a person in their native language, you are speaking to their heart.
This reminds us that we cannot rely solely on English to build strong relationships and trust with people in other countries.
According to the results of the examinations held in the independent schools this year, the language learning is at the top of the ranking.
Among students who studied foreign languages, 68 percent achieved the best results.
According to the data collected, among the 74 schools, 72 percent of the students spoke Chinese, 72 percent spoke German, 69 percent spoke French, and 63 percent spoke Spanish.
Independent schools in Scotland have acknowledged that learning foreign languages is a skill that children will need in the future.
Language learning is also frequently chosen among other subjects (science, mastery, engineering, and mathematics) in the programs of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 UK group opinion poll on employment and training showed that the lack of language-learning workers was responsible for 17% of job vacancies.
Therefore, the knowledge of foreign languages is becoming more and more important, because for young people it is the main issue of getting a good job.
As the need for language skills in high-performance jobs increases, the need for foreign language skills is increasingly evident in the globalized world.
Whatever profession a person who learns a second language chooses, the knowledge he has gained over the course of his life will always be a real asset.
A person who can communicate directly with someone from another country will automatically always be ahead of others.
In a 2013 survey by YouGov, over 4000 adults in the UK found that 75% of those who could not communicate in a foreign language and spoke only French exceeded 10% - this figure was 15%.
That is why emphasis on language learning is so important for today's children.
For a person who speaks several languages, especially in developing countries, it will always be more convenient to find a full-time job.
In Scotland, each school will teach in a different language.
Some schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will focus on those considered to be more important for the UK in 2020, such as Chinese and Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be teachers in independent schools who teach these subjects in several languages.
Scottish schools set out to create an educational environment that prepared children for the various challenges that awaited them in the future and taught them to fight for success.
In today's global work environment, languages play a crucial role in the future of the country, and this situation should be reflected in education.
Otherwise, modern languages should be considered as a form of interpersonal communication.
Independent schools will offer the opportunity, diversity and high quality of this education to the young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire. ((fr)) - You have to do everything right.
Head of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland, John Edward.
In San Diego , Lebron will make his first debut for the Lakers
Fans who are looking forward to James Lebron's basketball will soon see him in the Los Angeles Lakers.
According to Lakers coach Luke Walton, James will face the Denver Nuggets in the preseason opener in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it is not yet known exactly how many minutes he played.
On the team's official website, Walton's words are written: "More than a minute, but less than 48 minutes".
Lakers spokesman Mike Trudel tweeted that James will likely be given less playing time.
After the training earlier in the week, James told his brother about his plans for the upcoming three-game preseason.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to play in the preseason", he said.
YouTube viewership: The moment for Trump rallies in West Virginia
In the evening, President Donald Trump begins a series of rallies in the West Virginia city of Willing, just before the election of his son.
This was one of five planned rallies, including in quiet places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
After the Supreme Court's decision to postpone the presidential election, Trump sought help from the upcoming midterm elections, as the Republicans were determined to lose the leadership in Congress if they delayed the election until November.
When and how can you watch Trump's rallies in West Virginia?
The rally was scheduled for 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018, on Iti TuNayt channel.
You can also watch the Trump rally in West Virginia live on YoTop via the link below.
Perhaps the president was forced to appeal to Bretta Kavano, who sits on the Supreme Court, because the sexual misconduct charges escalated; the Senate's election to confirm the upcoming verdict was postponed by a week, while the FBI was conducting investigations.
But the main issue of these rallies was to help the Republicans with some direction of development, who had to face the trials associated with the November elections.
So, the five rallies for Trump's campaign next week are a wake-up call for activists and supporters as Republicans try to enlarge and preserve their party with people in the House of Representatives and Senate.
A Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters: "The president is very important to the leadership of Congress, so he is ready to visit all the states, and we will prepare for the pre-election campaign season".
According to the West Virginia Metro News Channel, the rally, which will take place today at the VэсБанко Arena in Wheeling, will likely be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and the media in Pittsburgh.
Trump, who is scheduled to arrive Saturday, will make his second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state where he won more than 40% of the vote in 2016.
Trump is forced to support Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is running for West Virginia.
Political scientist Simon Heder of West Virginia University told Reuters that it's not a good thing for Morrissey to have to put you up for the presidential race.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States national team prepares to fight for its hopes in Sunday's singles
After three one-goal games, the fourth golf competition on Saturday was significant for the Ryder Cup.
Such a reversal of direction is entirely invented in sport, but it is especially in such competitions that athletes sincerely believe in it.
Where is that upward trend now?
One day golf player Jordan Spit, who was on vacation, said: "They were ahead by six points, and now only by four, so we're not giving up because of the upward direction".
In the albizza, the lead was on the European side - 4 points ahead, 12 points in all matches.
According to Spit, the Americans are very motivated and motivated at the moment, because, for example, Spit and Thomas, who played together, can boast of three of the four scored points.
From start to finish, Spit was the bold key player.
Every time a decisive point was hit on his field, the celebration on the field was loud, because he and Thomas had to fight for the two points they had lost before.
His goal in the 15-day game was accompanied by the same ringing sounds on the field, and the golfer's genuine eagerness to win showed his confidence in the American team.
"Others should think more deeply now and care about their matches", Spit said.
That's all the players had to worry about.
Only 18 points were not enough to leave a mark in history.
The last two days of the Ryder Cup were dominated by the undisputed players of history, Francesco Molinaari and Tommy Flitwood, who were only a few points ahead of Spit and Tom.
These two volatile but well-known golfers in Europe have four out of four possible points, so everything should be fine.
In neither Friday night, Saturday afternoon, nor Saturday morning, did Francesco and Tommy score a single boggy (the number of hits that would be more than what a nest would have to do).
If Molinari and Fleetwood are the winners of the All-Europe on Sunday at Le Golf Nacionel, there will be no more prominent golfers than them, because they have such a strong drive in their hands, in their own hands.
As expected, the two players would play two separate nests before winning.
But it is still too early to talk about the whole of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat the heroic Serhio Garcia by four balls in the morning game, and he, in turn, played in a pair with Alex Noren.
The Spaniard Garsio and the Swede Noren were left behind by two dabbles with one boggy (two more than the number of strokes that should have been done in one nest).
On Sunday, of course, no one will be able to help you.
It is interesting to keep an eye on four golfers: how they communicate with each other, what advice they give, which ones they follow and which ones they don't, and how the game's ability changes in the blink of an eye.
In fact, the European team had a lot better results than that, for example, even in the final game, but these four games proved that America had the courage to fight, even though the states did not believe it.
Europe reaches the final of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10:6
After Saturday's four-player match, Europe led the Americans 10-6 and this was a big advantage for them in the final game of the Ryder Cup.
The winged duo of Francesco Molinairi and Tommy Flitwood beat Tiger Woods on the field of Le Golf Naсьonaal to cut the score to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who were about to take first place, beat the American team in the series by 3-1 in the morning's game after falling behind at the Heseltaine Golf Club two years earlier.
Although he played two matches in the States without giving up, they did not score enough points.
Jim Furyk's team needed to score eight points in 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, Fleetwood is the first European starting golfer to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari (who are nicknamed Moliwood after their surprise weekend game) are only the second duo to win double points in their first four games.
After overtaking Woods and Patrick Reed, they also defeated American starter Bryson DeShambo, with a decisive 5:4.
Woods, who played two matches on Saturday, had some bright moments in his playing time, losing 19 of 29 matches between the four men.
After four matches in the morning, Rose, who had rested a bit, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who had won first and third places in the world competition, by 2-1.
Although the weather was dry and clear, farther southwest of Paris, the European team was not in a particularly good position.
The triple tournament winners, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, scored two points on Saturday and set a new American record.
They won 2-1 against Spaniards John Ram and Jan Poulter, and later came back to beat Polter and Rory Makilroy 4-3 in four games.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has only twice come back from four points down in singles matches, and Furic's team would have had a draw to keep the trophy.
If they came in second in force for two days, the attack on Sunday would seem to be out of their hands.
North Korea reported that there would never be a unilateral disarmament without confidence
On Saturday, South Korea's foreign minister said that the continued US sanctions on the United Nations only exacerbate the countries' mutual trust, so it is unlikely that the situation is one of nuclear disarmament.
Minister Ri Yong Ho, speaking at the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, agreed that North Korea had taken important steps in the past year: completed nuclear and missile tests, withdrew its nuclear test sites and pledged to not proliferate nuclear weapons technologies.
"But we have not seen a response from the United States in the equation", the minister said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we will have no national security, and we cannot unilaterally disarm in these conditions".
While Minister Ri's complaints about Washington's lack of response to North Korea's gradual changes seemed familiar, his claims were seen as justified, as Pyongyang had been unilaterally opposed to decentralization last year.
In his message, Ri recalled the agreement reached by President Donald Trump and leader Kim Jong-un at the first joint summit in Singapore on June 12. The two leaders had promised each other that Korea would begin disarmament efforts and that America would guarantee their security.
North Korea had officially ended the Korean War of 1950-53, but expected the United States to give up its nuclear weapons entirely for Pyongyang first.
Washington, in turn, has been pushing for the easing of tough international sanctions on Korea.
Ri said that "America insisted on first disarmament and therefore even resisted the sanctions pressure to declare war over".
"The sanctions are people who dream of bringing us to our knees, they don't know our country at all.
Indeed, the sanctions that have not been lifted have only aggravated our distrust.
Ri did not say anything about plans for a summit between the two leaders, which would be held at the United Nations, where the American president would be remembered.
The minister pointed out that Kim and Moon Jae-in had met three times in the last five months: "If South Korea had been on the side of the centrists at this time, instead of America, we would not have been in a difficult situation of not being able to move forward or backward".
However, the mood of Minister Ri's speech to the Organization was much different from last year's, when the General Assembly confirmed that the "Mr. Evil" had not escaped the North Korean missile attack on the United States, as President Trump had previously called leader Kim the "rocket man".
This year, at the United Nations, the American president, who last year threatened to "totally annihilate" North Korea, praised the leader Kim for taking steps to disarm, but said that sanctions would remain in place unless North Korea was centralized, so many of the tasks ahead would have to be taken first.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time limit:  If he devotes two years, three years or five months to this question, it doesn't matter.
China and Russia have spoken to the United Nations Security Adviser about the need to reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that the Security Council's efforts to ensure the implementation of sanctions must continue without interruption, until the work on strict, complete centralization is completed.
The Security Council unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea beginning in 2006, thus attempting to cut off funding for Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.
He met with UN General Assembly spokesman Pompeo Ri, who would visit Pyongyang again the following month to share his plans for preparing for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not particularly successful.
And in July, he returned from Pyongyang and confirmed that he had good results, but only a few hours later, the North Korean politician was accused of making dangerous demands.
At a meeting this month, North Korea promised Moon to withdraw its missile and nuclear workforce if the American states did not take appropriate measures.
According to him, for Kim, these "necessary measures" were only a guarantee of security in Singapore, which Trump demanded, and were designed to improve communication with Washington.
A lesson on proper rest for Harvard students
A new lesson at Harvard University forced students of all levels to sleep more - a measure that was counter to the long-standing student culture of caffeine-laden nights without sleep.
Some of the most educated students at the world's leading universities are not even aware of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Цейsler, professor of Harvard Medical School, specialist of Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course and said it was unique in America.
She was inspired to start this work after talking about how sleep deprivation affects reading.
After graduation, a girl came to the professor and said: Why am I hearing about this all over again, only in my last year?
According to the student, the professor was surprised that no one had told him about the importance of sleep, writes Telegraph.
The course, which is the first of its kind this year, explains to students how sleep helps them both in school, in sports, and in general.
According to Paul Barreyra, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, the university decided to include the course in the program after learning how students were sleep deprived during the week.
The hour-long lesson contains many interesting, interactive questions.
For example, in the bedroom picture, students are taught the importance of stepping on coffee cups, stepping on bedbugs, and not getting enough sleep, even before going to bed.
Students then studied the risk of insomnia for heart attacks, strokes, depression, and even cancer.
The interactive landscape of the place of study, with various signs, makes the audience think about how they should spend their day.
We know that the behavior of students cannot be changed now.
But they should have a right to know about it - just like your right to know about the harm of your cigarette, added Professor Цейслер.
According to him, the culture of preparing for exams by staying up all night is in the air, especially with modern technologies and the increasing difficulty of studying - sleep deprivation is a problem for adults.
Convincing students that getting enough sleep is important is a secret weapon against stress, fatigue, and overwhelm, and even a way to avoid obesity - because less sleep is more likely to make the brain want more food.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California, studied chemical and physical biology; after he started this course in his first year, he helped Professor Цейsler to better organize the class.
According to her, she liked the lesson so much that she decided to do a general education lesson.
His hope, the next step, is to ask the aspirant students to complete this course before they are placed in other educational institutions.
Professor Цейsler advised students to put an alarm clock on both bedtime and wake-up time and to remember the dangers of blue screens and light-diode lamps.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks off Gerrard
In the away game, the Rangers suffered another defeat, losing 1-0 to the men's team of Steven Gerrard.
Ibraxman were confident of their first win in the away game after a 4-1 triumph over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holtan's team suffered a second defeat to coach Jerrard in 18 games, leaving his team 8 points behind and overtaking runners-up Lendbrookers Hartz.
After 7 minutes to break, Menga scored, one goal which did not satisfy the Rangers.
While Rangers were relegated to sixth place, Livingston moved up to third place and were only one ball behind Hibernian.
Other rangers could expect new inconveniences, as the lainsman (outside line judge) Kalum Spence had to be treated after something hit the base.
After beating the team in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup, Gerrard made eight substitutions.
On the other hand, a week earlier, Holt, who had just missed out on a place in Hart, had competed with that team of the Linwings 11 and had been well prepared to beat them every step of the way.
Maybe the Rangers had the ball on top, but the Livingston team decided better with the ball.
They should have been in within two minutes of Mengi knocking out Scott Pittman for the goal of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder took advantage of his big opportunity.
Keegan got a deep hit on Jacobs' penalty kick, but his partner on defense, Alan Litgow, took the backstand.
The Rangers took their notice, but in their third half there was more hope than confidence.
In the 15th minute, Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have scored when he collided with Stephen Louless, but the referee refused to hear the statement of the colombian.
In the first half, the Rangers scored twice, but the previous goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was not disturbed by the ball being hit by Lassaná Kulibalí's head and Ovi Eджарии's hand.
The first match was over and Livi was clear in the 34th minute, maybe no one would have denied that they were paying for the win.
Again, the Rangers failed to defeat the well-trained jack-o'-lanterns.
Arfield did not notice when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who had chosen Menga for the easy finish.
Gerrard decided during the break to trade Coolidge for Oyana Kent, and this exchange had the same effect when the striker replaced Moreloza, but Kelly was impressed by the lands to his block line.
But Livingston was always eager to invite the crowd to a game that was more like this: Littow and Halkett always got the ball in the long run.
Holt's team could have increased the margin in the final stage, but McGregor was able to stay strong to eliminate Jacobs before being knocked out by Litgow in the corner.
The replacement Glen Middleton of the Rangers, caught with Jacobs, again missed by a penalty, but Tomson again slipped.
Almanach: inventor of the Geiger counter
The time for this Sunday morning issue of the Almanac: 136 years ago, on September 30, 1882, and, we count..... the day of the birth of the future German physicist Johann Wilhelm Hans Geiger.
He invented a method of protecting against and measuring radioactive material, which is now called a Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been aided by many sciences, even being filmed in the 1950 film The Bells of Colorado with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The question is: What is the need for such a thing in the world?
Rogers: This thing is called a Geiger counter and it helps to find where radioactive minerals are, such as uranium.
If you listen closely, you can actually hear the radioactivity of minerals.
Evans: Look, there are really explosions!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But what he thinks out lives in the ham.
A vaccine against cancer can help immune system detect bad side effects
The vaccine against cancer has been developed to train the immune system to detect and eliminate negative foreign bodies.
This vaccine sees the detection of adverse outcomes as a way to address the problem.
Again, this method involves removing the foreign bodies from the human body and modifying them in laboratories.
He was then able to see the protein present in many common cancers and re-enter it.
The vaccine tested showed excellent results in various cancer patients.
One woman with ovarian cancer was cured of her disease for 18 months by this vaccine.
This method allows the vaccine to detect and then remove bad foreign bodies from the person, and after laboratory modification, it can further detect and re-introduce the protein HER2, which is present in many common cancers.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute of America in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results are very promising.
According to Professor Berzofsky, HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, such as breast, genital, lung and intestinal cancer.
This approach has been used to treat certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West, in support of Trump, made an appearance on Saturday Night Live.
But the outing did not go very well.
In "Saturday Night Live", Kanye West was embarrassed after the release because he decided to support Donald Trump, who was up for election in 2020.
When she made her third song, Гост таун, she wore a Trump-inspired hat, then began to talk about her opposition to the Democrats and showed her sympathy for the president.
"When I talk to a lot of white people, they ask me, 'How do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
If I cared about racism, I would have moved out of America by now, ", she said.
The show "Saturday Night Live" began with a parody starring Matt Damon; the Hollywood star was mocked for how Christine Blaysey Ford failed to give Brett Kavano a directive to the Senate Judiciary in a sexual misconduct suit.
Although West was not shown on the blue screens, the comedian Chris Rock posted several shots on social media.
It is unclear whether this publication was intended to disparage the Rock singer.
West also told the audience how difficult it was for her to wear the hat backstage.
I was ridiculed behind the scenes.
They told him not to wear it.
I was ridiculed behind the scenes.
And they looked at me with a very strange look", he told the Washington Examiner.
And West continued, "If you come to see the outcast, don't look at me, because I'll wear someone else's headwear if I want to, and I won't ask you what you're supposed to do".
Now, be human.
His words were at least twice received with delight by the audience and were so well received by the actors present that one witness told the magazine Вериити: The whole studio was in a terrible silence for too long.
Kanye West was invited to this show instead of singer Ariana Grande, because her boyfriend, the famous rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
The singer again dressed like a sprite bottle, and surprised everyone with the song this is what I like.
The leader of the conservative organization Typiyuэсэй, Kendis Turner, tweeted in support of the singer: To the most courageous person: Thank you so much for standing up to the crowd!
But then, in a tweet from Tolk show host Karen Hunter, West remained just herself and it was so surprising.
But I will not despise the man who is proud of my community, listen to his songs and buy clothes.
He is a free man.
And we have as much freedom as he does.
Before the show, the rapper had tweeted that he was forced to change his name, saying that "now my official name is not Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name: the famous star Diddie, whose other names seem to repeat after Paff Daddie, Paffie and Pi Diddie.
During the time of fellow rapper Snoop Dogg, he was known as Snoop Lyon, and of course, it is known that this late artist changed his name to Prinz.
Suicide in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was arrested after a knife attack at a restaurant in Belfast's east end.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballihacamore.
The accused is due to appear in Magistrates Court on Monday.
The indictment will be accepted by the Public Court.
The star of Game of Thrones, Keith Харинgton: Toxic Youth
He is best known for his heroic lead role in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor broke the tail of the hero: according to him, men who often play such roles need to show a tough attitude to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Keith was keen on how to solve the problem in the age of activism.
Recently, Kit married 31-year-old Rosie Leslie, star of the hit TV series Game of Thrones - the actor has expressed his willingness to solve the problem.
I'm asking myself, "When did we create the problem of men?"
How should we raise our sons in this situation?
The actor believes that the television should be largely responsible for the problem.
And he continued, "Is this man from his birth or did we learn it?"
What do they teach on TV, outside, if boys often have difficulties with being boys?
I think the big question right now is, how do we change this?
Because it is understandable to young men that something went wrong at some point.
In this interview, Keith expressed his desire not to participate in any of the upcoming "Game of Thrones" projects, as he was tired of fighting demonstrations.
Starting in November, Keith will play the lead role in Sam Shepard's film True West, about the producer and his brother-in-law.
Recently, actor Kit was right that the most sacred of the Game of Thrones' emotions turned out to be Rosie for him.
I met my bride at that very moment, and from that moment on I built my family.
In the fictional game that won the Emmy, Rozi played Kit's favorite spot - Igrit.
In June 2018, the couple got married in Scotland at the family home of Leslie.
HIV and AIDS: China reports 14% increase in infection
China reported a 14% increase in the rate of HIV infection among citizens with AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are ill in the country.
In the second half of 2018, it was reported that about 40 000 new cases were detected.
The majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, as was the case in the past.
Traditionally, in some parts of China, people are infected with HIV through blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected by this method is now negligible, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000 people in one year.
Sexual transmission of HIV cases is a major problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community is considered to be very harsh.
Due to conservative values in the country, according to known materials, 70-90% of LGBT swimming events among men ended with women being married.
The disease in these relationships is caused by a lack of sexual protection
To help with this, the Chinese government had promised to increase availability and availability of HIV-prevention drugs starting in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies the leakage of Republican Party Senators' data and claims conspiracy theory and dangerous deception against the United States
On Saturday, House member Maxine Waters revealed allegations that one of the representatives had posted the personal data of three Republican U.S. senators on the Internet.
According to the Los Angeles Democrat, these false claims are confirmed by uninformed experts and websites.
In a tweet, Waters said: "Lies, lies and just disgusting lies".
The data contained the home addresses and phone numbers of two U.S. senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The name of the deceased was posted on Capitol Hill during the hearings against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavano, which were held on Thursday.
The riot occurred after three senators questioned Kavano.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address of the source was associated with Waters's account and that the information was posted by a Waters employee.
Waters said that "there is no truth in this report".
The personal information and security of a member of my office has been compromised by these false accusations, and he should not be held responsible for it.
Waters said that "there is no truth in this report".
Waters's comments were immediately criticized in the media, with former White House press secretary Ari Fleicher saying:
He wrote: "To answer in a very bad language".
This procedure meant that he could not become a member of the Congress.
If a man is accused of doing nothing wrong, he should not be beaten.
He should be calm.
He should not question the accusers' words.
It should be quiet.
Flaysher compared Waters's opposition to Kavano's, as the judges had been bitter at his abusive treatment at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate, was forced to replace Waters in the upcoming election and left his comments on Twitter:
If true, it is a very surprising situation.
Waters reported that law enforcement had reported these false statements.
"We will find the perpetrators and they will be brought to justice, because such acts are more shameful for each member".
A sneaky parody of the English film Agent Johnny to the famous Rowan Atkinson
It is now common for every film to have something about Brexit - and so it seems to be with the revived comic franchise; the 2003 revival of Johnny English and the comic book series began in 2011.
Will this ridiculous film be a new export opportunity for our country?
Anyway, the more unusual Johnny English with the ball-eyed and rubber-faced look was licensed for a second release and in all Bulgarian - this film is, according to the cinematographers, a work of wide humour, but it was produced for non-English speaking countries.
Of course, he's just a more lazy spy, and his more interesting demeanor, his resemblance to Mr. Bean and even his voice like the singer at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics - that's what makes him such a unique hero.
He was also a character, settled in the form of a traveller and mysterious man, whom Atkinson played in the long-forgotten Barclayard attraction.
There are a few very interesting minutes of the last Johnnie English.
I loved watching Johnny English come to the helicopter, dressed in a medieval military uniform and with the air-winds of the helicopter repeatedly hitting his guard.
Atkinson's ability to be a grumpy comedian is well known, but the level of humor is weak and over-the-top, as he shows a good degree of humor in modern serious films such as 007 and The Impossible Mission.
To me, it's more like a comedy about adults than children, and the cliché of Johnny English is no longer interesting, and the silent film Mr. Bean is even more fun.
The fact that Great Britain is now in a very bad state is always an urgent concern.
Kevin was surprised to find that his small role as a supervising agent had somehow infiltrated the most secretive British intelligence organization and had begun to expose the names of other agents.
This was the last straw for the now-barely-coming prime minister, whose reputation was in a bad way: the actress Emma Thompson was completely given to the role of the fake Theresa May, but the script was not so difficult.
His detectives told him that he would have to re-examine a retired agent, because he knew the name of every active spy.
And that one episode of Johnny English, the retired, unhinged man who now works as a teacher in a rich school and gives lessons in espionage, even though he's not allowed to do so - that episode alone seemed a little funny to me.
English was soon sent back to Whitehall to conduct an emergency organization, and there he rejoined his former helpful sidekick, Bow - played by the late Ben Miller.
Bow is now a family man, his bride is like a commander, and it seems that this fun role was played in vain by Vicky Peppardini.
Thus, Batman and Robin meet again, and they make a terrible mistake in the Mystery of the Queen's Service, and meet the gorgeous Ofelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is tricked into a charismatic technological billionaire who convinces him that he will eliminate all of Britain's computer problems, and this is the evil Jason Volt played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their fun journey: dressed as waiters, lighting a fire in a French restaurant, going on a real yacht with Volte, and English making headlines with a virtual reality headset.
I don't remember the continuation, but of course, the humor of this film seems to be for children only.
A very moderate film.
And finally, in reference to Johnny English's other films, I ask: Couldn't the British film industry have given such a talented Rowan Atkinson a more appropriate role?
The Labour Party refused to set a plan that would allow the British to work four days but be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbin of the Labour Party devised a plan to work four days for the Bitanci, but be paid for five days.
According to reports, the money collected due to artificial intelligence will be paid to the workers by the heads of the companies for the fifth day.
Thus, the workers would enjoy three days' rest, but would take home the same money.
According to sources, this view fits well with the party's financial side and the plans of the country to bring the workers closer.
The move to a four-day workweek was supported by the Congress as a direct way for working people to take advantage of the opportunities of a frequently changing economy.
A key source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times that the political changes were expected to be announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen very soon, but a four-day workweek is more suitable for the party to move towards a sound economy and general industrial plans.
The Labour Party was not the first to come up with such plans - in 2017, the Green Party had already made a statement ahead of the snap election with a four-day system.
However, the Labour Party did not fully resist this attempt.
A party spokesman said: 'Four-day work is not party policy and we cannot care about it now.'
Chancellor John Macdonell held a Labour conference last week to focus his views on social change in the economy.
According to MacDonnell, it was important for him to regain control of the directors and the speculators.
These plans of the chancellor meant that once again the shareholders of these water companies could not get their share, because the Labour party could send the government different results if it disordered the order.
He also proposed plans to include ordinary workers in the board of directors of companies and to create funds for the subsequent transfer of property, and to give 10% of its capital to the workers of private firms, giving them dividends of up to 500 fountain per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discussed the possibility that the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their view on the political television show "60 Minutes".
The FBI's investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavano delayed the final election of his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least a week and left an acute question - whether the Bureau's results would lead to confidence in the support of Republican senators.
In the Sunday 60 Minutes interview, correspondent Scott Pellley spoke about the possibility that Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, who are both Republicans, believe that the FBI investigation could change their minds.
Kennedy was more visible than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
I spoke to Judge Kavano, who was supposed to be at the hearing.
I immediately called him and asked him if it was your fault.
He was very determined, bold and single-minded".
However, Graham's voice seems to be unchanged.
"I have made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, but it will require a very strong indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one: Brett refused it outright", Graham added, referring to Christine Blaysey Ford.
"None of the people who were present could prove this.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see any changes".
What is the Global Townsman Festival and has it helped in any way?
This Saturday, New York City will host the annual music event, Global Townspeople's Festival, which features influential stars as it addresses the crucial issue of how to fight poverty.
Now, after seven years of the event, tens of thousands of people gather at the Elder Grove in Central Park, not only to watch the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but to remember that the main goal of the event is to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Urbanists' Day, which was announced in 2012, is a continuation of the Global project on fighting poverty - an international interest organization whose main goal is to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people fighting poverty.
If you are not ready to get a VIP-ticket, then the person who comes to the show must do various activities to get a free ticket, such as volunteering, sending a letter to the world leader, making a phone call and other effective measures to address this problem.
But did the festival produce any results in 12 years?
Is the idea of giving a free concert the right way to convince real people, or is it more like clictivism - just signing petitions and believing that various posts on the internet are actually beneficial?
Since 2011, the Global Townsfolk Festival has registered over 19 million cases of aid and disputed works among them for various purposes.
According to reports, these goals have forced various world leaders and politicians to commit more than $37 million to the fund, which is expected to help more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the event's organizers reported that 390 works, worth about $10 billion, had been paid or collected.
According to the organization, the money collected at this time has left its mark on the lives of at least 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important must-do's is the British investor and leader organization The Power of Nutrition, whose main goal is to help children, and who, thanks to the 4700 tweets written in their name, have pledged $35 million to the country of Rwanda to fight the problem of malnutrition.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, the people's government and all the people around the world, we can eradicate the problem of hunger forever in history", said Tracy Ullman, spokesperson for the organization, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
Also, repeating the words of the organization, after more than 5000 steps were taken on the nutrition problem of mothers and children dedicated to Britain, the government announced a project to finance more than 5 million women with children.
One of the most frequently asked questions is, "How are we going to end extreme poverty?"
The festival website answers: This road will be very long and difficult - it will be in difficult times.
But if we remember the great long forgotten human rights movements, we will surely win this battle, because in unity is strength.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi Bee, Janeel Mone are the stars who will perform at this year's event; the New York festival will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
US Interior Minister: We can use naval forces to block Russian energy exports
Washington could use its naval forces to demand Russian energy exports if necessary, particularly in the Middle East, the Washington Examiner quoted U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke as saying.
According to Zinké, Russia is not involved in Syria in vain, especially since the situation called for by the Legislative Government is only a pretext for the discussion of the energy market.
"I think the reason Russia is a frequent visitor to the Middle East is that they are intermediaries in the energy sphere, because the same is true in Eastern and Southern Europe", the minister said.
According to the leaders, there are many ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States has the advantage of having a transparent Navy and, if necessary, not having access to the free market for their energy resources", he said.
Zinké addressed participants at the Non-Profit Organization Meeting of the Energy Consumers Alliance, who considered themselves the "voice of the energy consumers of the United States".
He compared Washington's view of the situation in Russia and Iran, saying that they were similar.
"The option of Iran and Russia is just to use and replace fuel", he said, noting that Russia's profile is limited because the Russian economy is tied to the burning fields.
These statements came as the Trump administration was faced with the problem of increasing and selling natural gas to Europe at a much cheaper price in order to push Russia out.
By the way, US President Donald Trump and his administration have urged Germany not to participate in the construction of the North Stream-2 project, which is expected to increase Russia's influence in Europe.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the $11 billion North Stream-2 pipeline will double its capacity to 110 billion cubic meters and is merely an economic project.
The Kremlin claimed that Washington's fierce opposition to the project was purely economic and exemplified a disingenuous struggle.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak stated during his September meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow: "I think energy resources should not be a tool of pressure and consumers have the right to choose their own suppliers".
The negative position of the United States had a negative impact on Germany, which agreed to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the German Federation of Industry, advised the US Energy Policy Organization and Berlin and Moscow to stay away from bilateral agreements.
After the meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the head of the German Federation of Industry, Dieter Kempf, said: "I will be in a difficult situation if a third country gets involved in our energy issue".
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Worrentz has announced plans to run for president in 2020
On Saturday, Massachusetts state senator Elizabeth Worrent confirmed that she intends to run for president after the congressional midterm elections.
In the administration building of the city of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his intention to run for president.
The Hill newspaper quoted her as saying: "It is time to give women the right to travel to Washington and rule the country by changing the government's harsh view of us".
I will seriously think about participating in the presidential elections after November 6.
Warren expressed his opinion that US President Donald Trump was not leading the district in the right direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy", he said.
Warren boldly gave Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavano his negative assessment.
On Friday, he wrote on his Twitter microblog: "But before the election we will need an FBI investigation.
However, according to the results of the polls published on Thursday, many voters disagree with Warren's participation in the 2020 election.
According to a poll by the Center for Political Research at Saffolk University, 58% of Massachusetts voters believe the senator will not win the election, according to a Boston Globe article.
Thirty-two percent supported his candidacy.
The most votes from the polls were cast by former state governor Deval Patrick; in the potential race, 38% were in favor and 48% opposed.
In the run-up to the 2020 presidential race, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders were mentioned alongside other prominent Democrats.
As reported by the Associated Press, Biden said he would make his official decision in January.
Sarah Palin told Donald Trump at a polling place: "My son has a post-traumatic stress disorder".
Tрэk Payn, now 26, served in Iraq for a year.
On Monday night, he was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence.
"I understand very well the other families, when my son returned from the war, our soldiers brought him not only wounds, but also wounds of the soul", she said at a rally of voters for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paynlin called the arrest of his son a "deeply disturbing" topic, and said that his son and other veterans return from the war with a changed and tough heart. "The only question that bothers them is how much respect they have for the country, the soldiers and the military who have sacrificed for it".
Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wacilla Police Department in Wacilla, Alaska, said that Trek Payn was arrested on suspicion of domestic abuse - he threw a gun at a woman while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia oppose new U.S. policy on housing
The District of Columbia and eighteen states view the U.S. policy of supporting criminal groups, domestic abuse and violence as legally favorable.
As reported by NBC News, in order to refute such a policy, representatives of 18 states and the District of Columbia in Washington, D.C., on Friday appealed to the court consultation to protect refugees.
The real name of Grace was not mentioned in the legal suit against Sessions against the federal politician, which was decided by the American Free Citizens Union in August.
Grace was persecuted by her partner and the bloodless sons of Xu - members of the gang, but on July 20 the United States refused to give her asylum.
He was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Grace considered gangs and domestic violence in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala to be the most common problem, as these countries have the highest number of asylum seekers in the United States.
A new 2014 U.S. law overturned a previous immigration board decision to provide shelter to undocumented refugees fleeing domestic abuse.
On Friday, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Rasin noted that the new policy "abolishes state, federal and international laws".
According to the court consultation, "all appeals under federal law were considered on a case-by-case basis, and this prohibition abrogated all principles".
The lawyers said in their appeal that the policy of not admitting refugees harms the US economy, as most would be entrepreneurs and create jobs.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June allowed immigration judges to stop providing refugees with shelter.
In his statement of 11 June, Seshns stated: "Asylum is only available to certain social groups who are persecuted or threatened because of their race, religion, nationality or political views".
The refuge was never meant to solve all problems, even the biggest problems of everyday life on the planet.
The number of victims during the rescue operation in Palo doubled in search warrants
The situation was difficult for the survivors.
In the evacuation center in the city of Palou, 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who is in a very tense condition, comforts her son who is in a difficult situation.
A ambulance is available every minute to evacuate critical situations.
Clean water is scarce.
People saw those returning to their homes trying to save their flooded belongings.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake destroyed hospitals, injured hundreds of people.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were left in the Paluu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to prolonged tremors.
His eyes filled with tears when he recalled the powerful earthquake that occurred when he was staying in a hotel room with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save.
I think I was crushed by the wall debris", Harris told the Associated Press, adding, "We came to town with our family for a wedding".
I heard my wife scream for help, then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and child.
I hope they are in a safe place.
The American ambassador blamed China for using propaganda advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper made a four-page advertisement in the American daily newspaper about the mutual benefits of US-Chinese trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda to the US press.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump accused China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, citing a best-selling newspaper in Iowa published in the Des Moines Register, in a paid advertisement for the China Daily, but China denied the accusation.
US officials told Reuters that Trump accused Beijing of interfering in the US elections, which led to the creation of a new company in Washington to increase pressure on China.
Beijing and Washington equalized import tariffs due to their trade wars, while other countries placed their goods through advertising.
Chinese and American experts believe that new tariffs were devised in China to reduce exports from other states, such as Iowa, for Trump's support of the Republican Party.
U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Bransstad, a former governor of Iowa who sold agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In his article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstead wrote: "China is now doing a double-crossing by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
The Chinese leadership used the free speech and press traditions of the United States to spread its propaganda through paid advertising in the Des Moines Register newspaper.
On the contrary, in Beijing newspaper kiosks you will not find articles that highlight the Chinese people and the worrying economic development that disagree with the government policy, because the press materials are under the control of the Chinese Communist Party.
A well-known Chinese newspaper objected to the publication of his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts say Republicans are sidelined in the midterm election, following the example of Kavano's failure
Many Republicans support and endorse Brett Kavano's candidacy for the Supreme Court despite being accused of sexual assault; they will see a backlash in the midterm elections, especially from women in the background", noted the analyst.
In this tense time, the majority of Republicans expressed their desire to vote.
Professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, Grant Richer, said in an interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper The Hill: "These things are irreversible".
Richer doubted that the unexpected demand of Arizona state senator Jeff Flake, who said an FBI investigation would be enough to silence angry voters, would calm the situation.
As reported by Washington, D.C., on Friday, senior adviser and press-secretary of the international progressive group Move on, Karin Jean-Pér, noted: "It was a women's night, and they will not forget it tomorrow or in November".
As reported by the Mic news agency, when Kavanaugh was seen in the Senate corridor, protesters organized a demonstration on Friday under the slogan November Comes!, after Republicans who were watching the Judiciary Committee refused to look at the testimony of Christine Bleysi Ford and push forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy.
According to the impartial political analyst, Styu Rotenberg: "The interest in this work will be raised by the citizens".
People say that this is still in the language of the people and it is real.
But it may be higher, especially among hesitant female voters in the suburbs and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don't vote even if they don't like the president".
Until Ford's public testimony, which indicated his accusation of sexual assault, analysts predicted a sharp reaction if Republicans rushed to confirm the nomination to the Supreme Court.
Earlier this week, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said that the event was "very confusing" for the Republican Party, NBC News reported.
As the director of the U.S. Preferential Committee, Guy Cecil, who assisted the Democrats in the election, observed: "The word here is not just about electing or being elected to the committee, but about putting Kavano on the bench and how they came out of this situation, what their attitude was".
However, after the arguments of Ford and Kavano, the Americans were divided into two groups, but the proponents of the slug were more numerous.
A new YouGov poll showed that 41 percent of respondents believed or partly believed Ford's testimony, and 35 percent believed or partly believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents believed that Kavano was deceived in his presentation, and 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
Flakes's press release says the FBI is investigating another witness to Kavano's victim, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Kavano testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had drunk himself and jumped into Ford when he was 17.
During a party at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court nominee showed off her genitals, Ramirez claimed.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet in opposition to Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web, computer genius Tim Berners-Lee, has launched a new startup in the face of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The project, built on the Solid platform with open source code from Berners-Lee, was called Inrupt.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored, who they can access it to, or whether they want to provide information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt is to dominate the world.
'We have to do it now,' he said of the startup.
This is a historical moment.
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data.
It contains a contact list, a to-do list, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all on one browser and all at once.
The uniqueness of online personal data storage is that the user chooses what information he or she can access.
The company calls this personal empowerment with information.
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company offers resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of a security platform purchased from Berner-Lee, Bruce, IBM, several state-owned developers and an organization of freelance programmers hired to work on the project.
Starting this week, developers around the world will be able to use their centralized applications, a tool available on the website Inrupt.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team are not going to discuss the issue of a complete business model change with Facebook and Google in consultation with Facebook and Google.
We do not ask them for permission.
On Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote on his Medium portal: "The mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem, protecting the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid".
He created the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a key role in the discussion of net neutrality.
Despite launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the Open Information Institute, World Internet Consortium, an international non-profit organization Web Foundation.
"I remain optimistic about the future era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Victoria Cross winner of the First World War is celebrated
One hundred years later, the only clergyman of the Anglican Church to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his heroism in the First World War.
On 29 September 1918, during the assault on the communes of Belanglish and Leokur, the Podpolkovnik Bernar Vann received the award.
However, he did not know that he had received the highest military award of Great Britain, as he was killed by a sniper 4 days later.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was erected in his honor at a parade in the county of Northamptonshire, in the town of Rashden, with the participation of his grandchildren.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the plaque was "a great meaning" 100 years after the heroism of his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, under the heavy fog, heavy artillery and machine gun fire, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Vanne, his battalion passed through the Canal de Saint-Kant.
Finally, reaching the firebrand, he led the line forward with great valour and single-handedly destroyed three of the detachment.
A month before the end of the war, on 4 October 1918, the German sniper killed Podpolkovnik Vann.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said he would never be able to repeat the "heroic" of his grandfather.
After the parade of the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood, he and his brother Dr. James Vanne placed flowers in the family's memorial to their grandfather.
"It was a great pleasure for us to be able to participate in the parade, because it was a great success for us to show the hero's heroism.
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Swinka Pepppa
Imagine that you stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 tournament, but were denied access.
The schedule of the tournament in San Jose included 13 matches, six of which were shown on the main map overnight on 5 UK channels.
At 6 o'clock, when Gegard Musaci and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a face-to-face meeting, the replacement of the report by Svinka Pepppa shocked British audiences.
For some, it left no trace, for they did not sleep to see the battle.
One fan called the replacement of the show with a children's cartoon on his Twitter account a "somewhat absurd joke".
Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said: "This content at 6 a.m. was not worthy of the government's view, so we had to transfer it to a children's program".
Yes, Swinka Pepppa. I'm going to the movies.
Scott Kokker, president of Bellator, said they would work on their own schedule to ensure that UK fans could watch the tournament in the future.
I think we'll think about repeating the translation and work on it", said Koker.
Now in the UK, Sunday is six in the morning and we can't decide on our time until Sunday because they have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was interrupted, we were thinking about technical flaws and trying to correct them, there were many messages from both sides, and they were not friendly.
We thought about technical flaws and tried to correct them.
But this did not happen, and all questions were left to the government.
He promised that it would never happen again.
This time we increased the battle for the Fannats from five to six and we did not have time - in the future there will be five battles as always.
This is a sad situation.
Radio program Desert Island Discs reports: Tom Dailey felt like he was sexually attractive
Olympic diver Tom Daley grew up with a sexual attraction, but this was a strengthening of his own strength to win.
"I didn't realize that everyone was not like me until I went to middle school", the 24-year-old said.
In an interview with Radio 4's Desert Island Discs host Lauren Lavern, she spoke out in support of gay rights to inspire hope in others.
He also said that as the head of the family, he thought less about winning at the Olympic Games.
The longtime regular host of the show, Christie Young, took a few months off due to illness.
"She felt inferior to everyone else on Laverne's first show because it was unacceptable to like boys and girls at the same time", said Dailey.
His words: "Until that moment, I had a feeling of being worse and different than others, and it gave me the strength and energy to succeed".
According to her, she wanted to prove herself as an individual so that knowing her sexual orientation would not change the way people viewed her.
At this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, the two-time bronze medalist, a member of the LGBT campaign, called on other countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He explained his courage by his ability to live openly and the shame that others felt.
"I fell in love with American director Dustin Lens Black, whom I met in 2013, and it started unexpectedly", said the three-time world champion.
She married an Oscar winner 20 years her senior last year - and said the age difference was never a problem for her.
She went to her first Olympics at the age of 14 and 3 years later her father died of cancer - "It's hard to find people who have had one rise and one fall at the same age and who have gone through so much despite being young", she said.
In June, Robert Ray told Black-Dayley: "My view of the world has changed", said Dayley.
"If you asked me last year, I would say I should have won a gold medal".
But you know, there are things in the world that are more important than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbi.
Her son, Robert, was named after his grandfather, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from a brain tumor.
"My father couldn't accept his mother's death and one of his questions was about the availability of tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, because he wanted to sit in the front row", said Deyley.
"I couldn't tell you that you couldn't sit in the front row, Dad", he said.
"I held his hand to my thigh and when he stopped taking money, I thought he was a nice guy", she said.
In her sophomore year, she won bronze at the 2012 Olympic Games.
"I knew that swimming in front of my people at the Olympic Games was my lifelong dream", he said.
Also, the song Proud by Hézér Smol inspired her during the preparations for the Olympic Games and took her to her heart and still pierces her body today.

The Mikelson game in the Ryder Cup is very loose
On Sunday, American Phil Mikelso will set his own record in the 47th Ryder Cup, but he needs to get back to his form so that the record is not a disaster.
Mikelson, who was competing for the 12th time every two years, was replaced by captain Jim Furik in Saturday's forwards and foreballs.
The five-time winner, who was at the center of many events in the United States, spent half his days sitting in the fan stand and the rest of his time on the field working on the game that bothered him.
The 48-year-old was not at ease even at the peak of his career and the uneven narrow field at Le Golf National was not very suitable for him and gave the player his punishment due to his mistaken hits.
Although the golf course did not scare off in Sunday's 9th game, Mikelson is set to play against the winning Great Britain player, who has joined newcomer Tommy Flitwood to win all four games this week, and the Open champion, Francesco Moменаri.
If the Americans, who are 4 points behind in 12 games, get a "hot start", the game could be tense for Mikelson.
Furik expressed confidence in his companion, though that was all he could say about him.
"He understood his role in the game today, he hugged me on the back and said he was ready for tomorrow's game", said Furik.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has worked with the team before and this week.
I didn't know he played two matches.
I tried to convince myself that we should go as we thought, and that's what happened.
He wants to be where others are.
On Sunday, Mikelson surpassed the record of Nick Faldo by surpassing the number of Ryder Cup games.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never matched a personal record.
In 7 taims, Mikelson has won 18 and lost 20, but Furic believes that his presence in the team has a different feeling.
"He's a very wordy, funny, thorny guy, he likes to make jokes and he's a very good guy in the team", he explained.
I think the young players got excited when they played with him last week.
It offers more than just a simple game.
Thomas Bjorn , captain of the European team , knows that his big advantage may be lost
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knew from experience that the final day of the single-season Ryder Cup could turn into a heated race.
In his first match in 1997, Valderram, led by seventeen-year-old Sev Ballesteros, won by the smallest margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2, five points ahead of the Americans.
"You always remember the great advantage in Valderram: our advantage was when we lost in Brooklyn and when we won in Valderram, there is no surplus", Bjorn said on Friday after looking at the results of the game with the score of 5:3 in 2018 and yesterday's score of 10:6 by Golf National golf club.
So history will show me and this team that this is not the end.
You'll do better than that tomorrow.
Go there and do it right.
It won't be over until you've scored.
Our goal is to try to win and that's what we're focused on.
I've got 12 players playing for us and we know we're up against the best players on the planet", I said.
Always excited about how players would play on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never rush ahead of time".
Tomorrow there will be a race with another man.
Tomorrow will be a separate competition, and that's another matter.
It's nice to be with your partner when the competition is going well, but when you're playing alone you're testing your skills as a golfer.
We have to get the players to put all their strength into tomorrow's game.
Tomorrow, I'll have to forget about putting all my strength into the game and give it 100 percent.
His teammate Jim Furik will have better competition than his players in individual events than in pairs, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Tomas, who scored three points from four.
On the final day, Furiq himself was at the head of both of these changes; as a representative of the winning team in Brooklyn and as the loser of the European national team after he had scored the Medina miracle.
In 1999, captain Ben Krenshow, gathering his team before the final race, said: "I know every word that's going to be said".
Tomorrow we have 12 important games and you want to start as fast as in Brooklyn and Medina.
This force was greatly pressured into the match when it was only going one way in the middle of the tournament.
We tried to prepare your team, in a way that we thought was miraculous.
Thomas was unable to get up at the start of the attack and was challenged in the top-flight match with Rory Makilroy, Paul Casey, Dustin Rose, John Ram, Tom Flitwood and Ian Poulter, and other Europeans in the top half of the game.
After his particular choice, Bjorn said: "The reason I behave like this with this group of guys is, I think, because they are so attractive to me".
Germany ' s new warship is delayed yet again
According to local press reports, the new German Navy frigate was to be introduced in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but due to the inadequacy of the systems and the rapid rise in prices, this delay was resurrected.
According to the newspaper Die Zeif, according to a representative of the military sector, the commissioning of the new frigate Reypland-Pfaalz, which is similar to the Baden-Vürtemberg, is delayed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was to be delivered to the Navy in 2014, but problems with the supply of manufactured goods prevented the ambitious project.
The four ships of the class Baden-Vürtemberg will replace the older frigates of the class Bremen, ordered by the Navy in 2007.
According to calculations, they were equipped with powerful gun, anti-ship and anti-satellite missile sets, as well as low radiolocation, optical and infrared surveillance technologies.
Other important features of the new frigates included the fact that they were to be sent for even longer maintenance - two years away from their bases in the port.
However, as Die Zelt notes, the constant delays indicate that these advanced warships will be outdated by the time of the use of armed force, in addition to demonstrating their capabilities to Germany among other countries.
Last year, the German Navy officially refused to commission the disastrous F125 and returned it to the shipyard - instead of building and repairing the ships at Hamburg's Blohm & Voss - the newspapers headlines.
This was the first time that the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder.
The reasons for the return of the ship were not stated, although the German mass media pointed to the ship's "severe programming and hardware flaws" and relied on its ineffectiveness in the performance of military duties.
The lack of a supply program was particularly significant, as the crew of the vessels of the "Baden Vürtemberg" had to employ about 120 sailors, which was only half the personal strength of the earlier "Bremen" class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship's weight was too heavy, which reduced its performance, thus delaying the future modernization of the Navy.
The 7000-tonne ships of the Reynland-Pfaalz were twice as heavy as the German ships of the same class used in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the project was also costly, taking into account the training of the crew.
The price was remarkably high: from an initial cost of 2.2 billion euros, the current price reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars).
The problems with the new frigates are particularly important because of recent warnings about the reduction of German naval forces.
Earlier this year, Parliamentary Commissioner for Military Forces Hans-Peter-Bartels admitted that the reserve ships near the expansion (dislocation) of the Naval Fleet were actually running out.
According to the official, the problem was exacerbated over time, as there were no new replacements for the old ships that had been out of service.
He was disappointed that not a single frigate of the class Baden-Würtemberg could join the fleet.
National Fund studies the secret life of sea lions
The search for the Scottish Highlands was aimed at finding out how the jaguars used the ladshaft in their hunting.
We hope that the data obtained will bring new innovations to the study of the life of rare nesting mammals and help the conservation of nature.
Researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will be involved in the study of the great dwarf, the small great dwarf, the long-eared grey dwarf, and the devil butterfly, the Dabonton, which is found in the Interview Gardens in the Wester-Ross district.
During the entire season, special registrars will be installed in key locations around the hotel to monitor the livelihood of the lizards.
Also, employees and volunteers of the ShMF will conduct mobile surveys using portable detectors.
By recording and analyzing sounds, it is possible to determine the frequencies and types of sounds of the larvae.
The next step is to map and report the habitats, and to study the landscape by copying to create a picture of their life.
Rob Dyuar, a nature conservation advisor at the ShMF, is investigating what areas of the vineyard are in, and how each area is taking advantage of the features.
This information will help to determine the relationship between habitat management, grassland management and how the herons are related to forestry conservation and other species.
In Scotland and Great Britain, the population of the black-footed ferret has declined over the past 100 years.
They are threatened by construction and technological activities, which prevent them from adapting to their living conditions.
Wind and lighting equipment, such as sticky tapes for seeds, chemically processed building materials, and domestic cats are also a danger.
The lizards are not actually blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, ears are more useful than eyes when catching prey.
They use sophisticated technical echolocation to avoid obstacles in their flight paths.
The country is seriously considered by the SMPF, which has 270 historic houses, 38 important gardens and 76000 hectares of land.
There are 10 trained specialists who help with regular examinations and night visits.
The organization has even created the only specialized sparrow reserve in Scotland, with 8 of the 10 species living on the David Topson estate in Trev County.
According to area director David Thompson, the area is a good place for the larvae.
'This place, Trev, is good for sparrows,' he said.
Here are old houses, many perennial trees, and good living conditions", he said.
However, there are many unknown facts about the larvae, so we need to understand what is needed for the population here and elsewhere.
He stressed the importance of checking for the presence of caterpillars before serving on the property, since the destruction of one nest could kill 400 females and young caterpillars, and could wipe out the entire local population.
The larvae are protected by law, so every safety, killing, survival, overnight stay, destruction is checked.
The Scottish Foundation activist Elizabeth Ferrell called for help to preserve the sparrows.
His words: "We know about the sea urchins and we don't know about their populations in life".
Ronaldo denies rape charges and his lawyers intend to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegation of rape a "fake news" and said that people were going to be famous because of his name.
His lawyers were going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these allegations.
The attacker of the Portuguese and Juventus national teams was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in 2009 in a room at a Las Vegas hotel.
In 2010, Ronaldo was reportedly paid $375,000 to a woman to keep her from talking about what happened.
A few hours after the claim was published, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called it a "fake news" in front of 142 million Instagram followers.
No-no-no.
What they're saying today is a lie".
They think they will be honored for my name.
This is a common occurrence.
These things are part of my work.
I am a happy person and I am doing well".
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are going to sue Der Spiegel for "distorting news stories about his private life".
According to the lawyer, Christian Schertz, the footballer is accused of violating his personal rights and demands compensation depending on the degree of moral damage, probably the most serious violation of rights that has occurred in recent years.
The unfortunate incident is thought to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronald and Mayorgha reportedly returned to his room and, according to documents filed with Clark's Nevada court district, he allegedly raped Mayorgha.
According to the girl, after the rape, Ronaldo knelt before her and said: "I'm 99%a good guy, but I was cheated 1%".
According to the documents, they had slept together, but it was by mutual consent, as Ronaldou claimed.
According to Majorga, he had turned himself in to the police and photographed his wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement for fear of "open insults".
The 34-year-old woman said that she now wants to cancel the contract, because she still cannot get over the trauma of the incident.
After a fictitious attack on Ronaldo, he was one step away from a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Italian club Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret its car production
The UK will "regret forever" losing its status as the world's leading car manufacturer, according to Greek Clark, the post-Brexit minister for business and entrepreneurship.
According to a statement by the BBC, Toyota's official leadership said that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they would stop at Bernaston, not far from Derby - a news that made the minister think.
'We need a deal,' said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese carmaker has warned that a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses due to delays at the border.
The Bernaston plant, which produced about 150,000 cars, exported Toyota's Auris and Avencis brands during the past year, 90% to other European Union countries.
"If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, the production at our plant will stop", believes Martin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernaston.
British carmakers such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover were concerned about leaving the EU as they disagreed on how the car trade should work.
For example, BMW announced that it would close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month.
The biggest threat posed by car manufacturers is the no-deal exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Toyota production line, which operates at Twilling Time, receives spare parts for cars made to order from UK manufacturers every 37 minutes from the same European Union.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal by 29 March, there could be disruptions along the border, which industry workers believe could lead to delays and parts shortages.
Toyota said that the plant would not be able to hold spare parts for more than a day, and that production would be halted.
The "Change" plan, which was drawn up by Theresa May, is a well-calculated framework for future relations with the EU, so that such changes will not happen", Mr. Clark said.
"We want a deal", Mr. Clark said. <seg id="15" Translator-id='User 03'> "We want a good deal, the satisfaction of today's success, the possibility of a deal in the future", he told BBC Radio 4 in the program Today.
Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers have learned that we need to continue to work as hard as possible.
Toyota warned that it could not say how long production would be halted, adding that additional losses would reduce the factory's competitiveness in the future and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsuvallaris, the head of the Unite union, worked at the Bernaston plant for 24 years, and his colleagues were very sad: I can tell by experience that if jobs are cut, they will be gone.
The government spokesman said that "we have a clear and firm plan for our future relations with the European Union".
White House considers Trump and Rosenstein meeting likely to be postponed
The White House's meeting Sunday with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rozenstein may be "postponed for another week" because of the continuing battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavano.
Rozenstein, special counsel to Robert Müller, led the investigation into Russian election interference; ties between Trump and Russian aides were tied to the administration's potential opposition to the president.
Rumors circulated in Washington for several months that Trump would dismiss the deputy attorney general and thereby endanger Müller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rozenstein was recording conversations with Trump and investigating the feasibility of the 25th Amendment.
Rozenstein rejected this report.
On Monday, he made his way to the White House to announce his intention to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who is in New York on Thursday, was announced at the UN.
Trump "preferred" not to fire Rozenstein, but the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearings delayed the meeting to avoid a vote, and Brett Kavano and the woman accusing him of sexual harassment, Christine Blaysi Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Kavano, which has postponed the Senate vote for an even longer period.
On Monday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was interviewed by Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rozenstein, "They haven't set a date yet, maybe this week, I think they'll postpone it another week because of other things going on at the Supreme Court", he said.
See, I like to keep the press informed.
Some reporters have denied this assertion: Sanders has not held a briefing for reporters at the White House since September 10.
The presenter, Chris Wallace, asked why the program was not being held.
Sanders: I wouldn't call the absence of a briefing a peek at the TV reporters in order to show off, but I don't deny the fact that they showed off.
Trump did not deny the increase in direct meetings with the press.
"The president has more Q&A sessions than any other president", he said, without saying anything to prove it. "We looked at those numbers".
Sanders said the briefing would be held as usual, but if matbugat wants to ask the U.S. president a direct question, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it, you've seen how we've done it a lot a week ago, and a conversation with the president of the United States replaces a press briefing.
Trump has always answered questions not only at the White House, but also at public meetings, or at press conferences before high guests.
Single press conferences are very few.
He explained why he had been so open and amazing to reporters in New York this week.
Scottish Health Minister writes to EU worker, Scottish health officials about sorrow over Brexit
The Scottish Health Minister thanked the EU staff, the Scottish health workers and the country and its people and urged them to continue their work after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter six months before the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has taken on the responsibility of covering the costs of citizens working in the autonomous public service in applying for EU immigration status.
In her letter, Ms. Friedman wrote: "We have been negotiating with the UK about leaving the EU all summer and the decision we have been waiting for has been taken in the autumn.
But Britain also accelerated work on the possibility of a no-deal exit.
I know it's a very traumatic time for all of us.
That is why I wanted to say that every worker, regardless of his nationality, deserves respect.
The EU has a wealth of experience working outside of it, improving the work of healthcare workers and providing a great service to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland  is your home and we definitely want you to stay with us.
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Midfielder of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christiaan Aberkrombi, who underwent emergency surgery on Saturday after suffering a head injury while playing against the Vanderbilt Kommodores, lost the game by a score of 31:27, reports sports journalist Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Tennessee head coach Steyt Rod Reed reported that the injury was taken before the break.
"When it reached the Linea ridge, it fell", Reed said.
Trainers and doctors gave Abercrombi oxygen before putting him on a stretcher, and then took him away for further examination.
A representative of Tennessee State told Tennessee-based WSMV channel Chris Harris that he was released from surgery at Abercombie Vanderbilt Medical Center.
"We don't have any information about the type/size of the injury", Harris added, adding that Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
A second-year student, Abercrombi spent her first season in Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he attempted to catch the ball five times before the game was stopped, resulting in 18 repeats of this maneuver during the season.
New coat of arms tax on foreign buyers of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged an additional coat of arms tax when purchasing real estate in the UK; according to the new plans of the Tory political party, this money will go to the homeless program.
This move was made to frustrate Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in attracting young voters.
The additional coat of arms tax will be raised for non-taxpayers in the UK.
The UK Finance Ministry expects it to raise £120 million a year for the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged an additional coat of arms tax when purchasing real estate in the UK - the money will go to the homeless program, Theresa May announced today.
This move was seen as a downplaying of Jeremy Corbyn's successes by promising affordable housing to young voters and counting on high-income people.
The heraldic tax would be collected in Great Britain from individuals and firms who did not pay taxes, and the surplus money would give the government the incentive to create a program of affordable housing for homeless people.
Additionally, the new emblem tax on second homes and rental units introduced two years earlier was only 3%.
The UK Finance Ministry hopes to collect 120 million pounds sterling in taxes annually.
Estimates suggest that 13% of London's newly built homes are purchased by foreign representatives of the United Kingdom and that rising prices are preventing other people from buying.
Because of foreign buyers, many of the country's affluent areas, especially in the capital, were called "heart-cities" because they spent much of their time outside the country.
The new policy came a week after Boris Johnson asked many young people to reduce the new coat of arms tax to help them buy a house.
In a plea for the correction of the "British property scandal", May urged Mrs. May to abandon the quota for cheap property and accused her of the failure of the kings to remove the land, which was being used by large construction firms, but which they had not.
Mr. Corbin's new housing reforms included paying rent and evicting innocent residents.
His wish was to empower local self-government bodies to build new houses.
Mrs May: "I said last year that I would dedicate my premiership to reviving the British dream and improving the living conditions for the next generation".
This is called housing market reform.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, this does not apply to British foreigners who do not live in Britain but buy a cheap home and work.
The dream of creating their own home is a reality for many people, the problem of sleeping in the open air is very remote.
"My ultimate goal is to govern Scotland", said Jack Ross.
Jack Ross, manager of the Sunderland Football Club, had the ambition to manage Scotland one day.
The 42-year-old Scot, who finished third in the First League, three points behind, was very pleased to work on the revival of the North-Eastern club.
He moved to the Stade de Light this year after returning to the Scottish Premier League last season.
BBC Radio Scotland has broadcast the following to Sportsound:
I wanted to play for my country".
When I was a kid, I used to watch Scotland matches with my dad at Hampden Stadium and he always attracted me.
But such an opportunity will only come if I have great success in managing the club.
Sanderland's managers before Ross included Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Ellardays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gustavo Poyet and Paulo Di Kanyo.
After rejecting previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town and coming to manage a big Scottish football club, I was never afraid to come after such influential people", said future manager of Scottish football club, Alloa Athletic, Ross.
Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?
Due to its construction and capabilities, it has its place in the Premier League without a doubt", he said.
"To achieve this is not an easy task, but I will consider myself successful only if I bring the club back there.
During his managerial career, Ross worked as an assistant manager at Dambarton and coached at the Hearts staff for 15 months, but only for 3 years.
He then helped Alloá to the third echelon after relegation and lifted Sent-Mirren from the relegation threshold to the title champion the following season.
I feel more comfortable than I did during the climbs of Clyde, Hartlpul, Folker, Sent-Mirren and Gamilton Akademik", said Ross.
"It must have been a very trying moment", he recalls, taking responsibility for Alloa.
I sincerely believed that management was more important to me than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was fine, doing well, and forgiving.
But playing is complicated.
You have to go through a lot every day.
I still go through stress and pressure, but management makes me feel good.
I have always wanted to rule, and now that I am ruling, I feel comfortable in all aspects of my life.
You can listen to Jack Ross's full performance on Sunday 30 September from 12:00 to 13:00 on the BBC Radio Scotland show Sportsound.
The best time to drink beer is Saturday at 17:30 according to survey data
Great pressure was put on restaurant chains, although this led to an increase in the revenues of British pubs experiencing financial difficulties.
Statistical surveys show that sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while in restaurants they decreased by 4.8%.
According to sales company CGA Peter Martin: In the arc of England's prolonged participation in the World Cup and the prolongation of hot days, July went along the scheme of June: if the pubs saw a 2.8% increase in turnover, restaurants suffered the most.
The 1.8% decline in sales volume in June only intensified in July.
Other intangible pubs have the same inequality as the losses of restaurants.
Food and pubs were also affected by the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
People wanted only water to drink.
Sales of drinks in pubs and bar chains increased by 6.6% per month, while food sales were only 3%.
Paul Newman, an analyst at the cultural-recreational and hotel company RSM, said: "This is a trend we expect to see from April, .
When it comes to the external market, weather, social and sporting news remain the main conditions.
Despite the difficulty of reducing sales by 4.8% compared to the previous year, most restaurants are trying not to give up and continue the struggle alongside cost reduction.
The long, warm summer was a difficult time for food-obsessed companies, and only time will tell if the mild weather we experienced in August was breathtaking.
The increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, along with new holdings, was 2.7% in July and showed a gradual introduction of brands to the market.
The Coffer Peach Tracker control is an example of the collection and analysis of £9 billion in revenue by 47 working groups for British pubs, bars and restaurants.
Every fifth child in Russia has a secret account in social networks
According to the survey, every fifth child, some as young as 11, has a social media account that is hidden from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20 000 middle school students showed an increase in fake pages on Instagram.
This news pointed to the danger of a proliferation of sexual writings.
20% of students were able to show their main accounts to parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, have social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20 000 middle school students showed an increase in fake pages on Instagram.
This news pointed to the danger of a proliferation of sexual writings.
20% of students were able to show their main accounts to parents, with censorship, without any extra information and in a private way.
One mother read on the website of her 13-year-old daughter that she was encouraging others to "rape" her.
According to a study by the Digital Awareness Research Center and the Conference of Private School Directors, 40% of students aged 11 to 18 have two accounts and half have a private account.
Mike Bykenen, head of the private school in KD, said: "Many teenagers are online, so parents and teachers can't find them".
Earlier this year , at the Scottish Athletics Council , the voice of the competitors will be played by Эйлид Дойл .
British track and field athlete, Eilid Doyle, was elected as a volunteer director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the annual meeting of the higher bodies.
The decision by Doyle, Scotland's most prestigious athlete, was described by the head of the board, Jen Beatty, as a chance for those managing the sport to use the experience of the last decade of the athlete.
"He is a very respected figure in the Scottish, British and international athletics organizations, and we believe that if he is included in the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors, he will be very useful", said Beatty.
"I want to be the voice of the athletes and help lead Scottish sport and make my contribution", Doyle said.
Her partner, the four-time Olympic Games champion American runner who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, lost her ability to walk after a micro-stroke, and is now a regular expert on Bi-bi-si.
"I had a stroke a month ago", he wrote on Twitter.
I could not walk.
Doctors said that time would tell if he would recover.
It was a difficult task, but he recovered completely, learned to walk again, and is now exercising!
Thank you for encouraging me with your words.
Voice in the network for ads comparing mammals to cows
The company that produces milk-milking equipment also agreed with public opinion on the comparison of nursing mothers to dairy cows in advertisements.
The technological consumer company Elvie has released a humorous video-presentation called the world's first silent deck hill, the purpose of the video is to make the life of nursing mothers easier.
In the cow-clad mansion, four mothers dance to the tune of a song with the words: Yes, I am my own milk, but you do not see my tail and If you do not see it, it is not a cow's milk, but my milk.
The addendum continues: 'Shoul, shoul, I feed the children, shoul, shoul, I breastfeed my wives.'
However, the ad, which was posted on the Facebook page, sparked controversy in the network.
This recording, which gathered 77000 viewers and hundreds of comments, aroused a disagreement among the audience, many of whom expressed that they had not fully appreciated the fears of the dairy industry.
One user said, "It's a very tricky thing to advertise cows in this app".
They need to get pregnant and give birth so they can have milk like us, but the difference is that when they have children, they steal them.
The sucker was placed on a breast-gaulter with the name Elvie/Mother, which was unrecognizable to the sucker.
The second explained: "It is clear that the injury is for the mother and the child".
Hey, what's the point of using them in advertising?
Others say that it is advertising that is far from real.
Others supported the ad, and one letter seemed to him to be "joyful".
I think it's a great idea.
If I were breastfeeding, I would buy a vacuum cleaner like this.
Milking made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement was a little dreamy, but I took it as it was.
This is a genius king".
Second comment: This is a joke about mothers who breastfeed in the toilet or at work and feel like they are cows.
This is not a publicity praising or denigrating the dairy industry .
In late spring, women dance with milk pumps in their box-loaded bust-gaulters.
The concept of the campaign was based on the fact that most women feel like cows because of their breastfeeding.
However, the Elvie device is silent, without wire and tube, inserted in breastgallters undetectable and allows the mother to carry her babies around and out during breastfeeding.
According to Ana Balarin, director and partner of the advertising agency Mother, Elvie is a revolutionary product, and it deserves to be sent with boldness and seduction.
When comparing the milking of cows and insemination of cows, we showed the problems of milking and the feeling of relaxation in the fascinating and interesting form of the new pump.
This is not the first time that milkshakes have appeared on the front page of a newspaper.
During the London fashion week, a mother of two walked onto the podium of designer Marta Yakubovsky with a milk syringe.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly placed in tent camps along the border of Teham
The number of detained migrant children has surged, but border crossings have not changed in months, which is due to the Trump administration's statements and measures that have made it difficult for their adoptive parents to take the children in.
Most of the adoptees were once undercover immigrants themselves, so those who claim their rights for children risk being left behind.
The threat came in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members would have to take fingerprints and be sent to immigration authorities.
Last week, senior immigration and customs officer Matthew Albenz arrested people who had filed dozens of petitions before Congress for the agency to take custody of minors.
Later the agency found that 70% of the arrested were not convicted.
Up to 80% of the people, sponsors and people in sponsored families, are living in this country illegally and most of them are foreigners.
That's why we are persecuting these people".
In order to speed up the processing of the children, the authorities introduced new rules, some of whom, according to the workers of the priots, must appear in court within a month after their arrest, not 60 days.
The immigration court may not be attended by the applicant personally, but by videoconference.
Those who refuse to provide assistance will be immediately expelled from the country.
According to the words of the workers of the priyut, the prolonged detention of children who arrived in the last month, the prolonged detention of children, increased the incidence of childhood unrest, flight, violence.
According to the lawyers, this risk is found in large institutions such as Tornilio, because the large territory of the camp is dangerous for children.
If you move children without emotional preparation, it will harm the psyche of children if they do not say goodbye to their friends", they added.
Syria calls on America, France and Turkey to withdraw their "occupying forces"
Despite eight years of war in the country, United Nations Secretary-General Walid al-Mugalim called on Syrian refugees to return home.
Deputy Prime Minister Mugalim said that foreign troops who are illegally in Syria under the pretext of fighting terrorism will be dealt with.
"They must leave the country without any conditions", he told the assembly.
"The war in Syria ended in 2011, when 360,000 people were killed and millions were displaced", he said.
It is Damascus that continues this holy war, liberating the territory of Syria from the terrorists and the illegal aliens", said Mugalim.
The United States maintains about 2,000 armed forces in Syria, training and advising them; in general, the US has been inciting both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
The war-torn country was ruled by France with an armed force of over 1,000 men.
"The conditions are good for the return of refugees", said Mugalim, who blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fear" that encouraged refugees to stay out.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to assist in their return", he said.
"They politicize a question that is only humanitarian".
"Without a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on a ceasefire, no assistance will be provided for the reconstruction of Syria", the United States and the European Union warned.
Diplomats from the United Nations said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last Idlib uprising provided an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces targeting the three-million-populated province.
However, Mugalim noted that the terms of the agreement were "clear"; it gave hope that the war would be "destroyed" by the jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon draft a post-war Syrian constitution and hold the first sessions of a new committee composed of representatives of the government and opposition, which will pave the way for elections.
The Muğalim stated that the committee's work should be limited to consideration of the articles of the current constitution, and added to the mix, setting the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee.
Why Trump Will Win His Second Term
According to this logic, Trump would win the 2020 election if the president's term did not expire early due to impeachment or a controversy, as most liberal viewers had hoped.
Without a doubt, this is the most dramatic presidential final in history!
At this time, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the ratings of prime-time time on CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers, while on MSNBC the ratings have tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, Fox News had 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and now has 2.4 million viewers during prime time. The first place was taken by the evening news program, Rachel Maddow Show, on MSNBC, which has 3.5 million viewers.
"This is the fire that these people are drawing, we will not understand it", said Neil Baer, the showrunner of the drama "The Last Candidate" about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack on the Capitol on ABC.
Neill Showell, a veteran of comedy genre scripts and author of The Happy Seasons: And How to Get into the Hollywood Boys Club, relies on another theory.
He recalled riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver informed him that he had chosen Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because it's interesting", the driver replied, as Mrs. Showell had said.
Chaos makes people feel better.
Undoubtedly, unlike anything else on television, the Washington-based storylines can determine the future of "Rowe Wedded", the ability of immigrant families to unite, and the health of the world economy.
Only the most superficial spectators can have the delight of extinguishing.
Yet it's not just about being informed citizens, because sometimes at 6 p.m. you find yourself sitting around a panel of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward's "Fear" book, looking at the results of Paul Manafort's $15000 ostrich-skin bombshell (the Washington Post called it "the full suit") and Sturmi Daniels' black-and-white depiction of Trump's anatomy.
I won't be able to look at Super Mario, for example, the same way I did.
Part of his job is to show you everything like a reality show, to give you food for the evening, " said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Stars of Lombard", about the daily casting and plot twists of the Trump show (the fight against the NFL, Kim Jong-un's praise).
You can't miss an episode to stay behind.
When Mr. Flis visited this week, it was 27°C outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was not to be separated: at this time Brett Kavano was to meet face-to-face with the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs to determine the future of the Supreme Court, which was on the line.
I remember how we were doing these crazy shows at the time: "This is the beginning of the end for western civilization", Mr. Flis told me.
I thought he was joking, but he turned out to be right.

Foreign exchange enters the toughest midterm choice battle
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district saw a cash flow due to the grouping of congressional districts and therefore two presidents fighting for one seat.
In the newly renamed suburb of Pittsburgh, Republican Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a seat in the last spring's election, was living.
Currently, Lamb is opposed to the representative of the old 12th district, which resembles the new 17th Pennsylvania district, another incumbent, Republican Kit Rotfus.
The map was removed in January when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old regions had been unconstitutionally changed in favor of the Republicans.
The contest for the new 17th district included a financing struggle between the Democratic Electoral Committee of the Congress and the main financial parties of the National Republican Electoral Committee.
Lamb's name became known after winning a special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March.
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the region by 20 points.
Political experts favored the Democrats.
The US fined Salvador for aiding China, but later refused
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing, while Washington resisted.
In June 2017, Trump met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella and stayed briefly at a Panamanian hotel before the partners transferred the leadership of the Trump Organization.
"For recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan, State Department officials have decided to recall representatives of the American diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama", department spokesman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
Perhaps the fines were just for Salvador: in 2017, it had received about $140 million in aid from the United States, including for drug research, development and economic aid.
The proposed penalties, which would include cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be too severe for Central America and its extremely high unemployment and murder rates.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-profile meeting devoted to security and economic growth to continue the previous meeting that year, which had discussed the possibility of reducing the number of migrants arriving in the United States.
However, in mid-September, officials of the high administration expressed their desire to continue the conference, thus ending the investigation into the imposition of fines for Salvador.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence is poised to speak at a conference in mid-October to show the importance of the administration.
Then, uninformed and unpunished, the three American delegates left Washington for El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic.
Mr. Bolton's White House representative refused to give details of the debate, and three American staffers, including two diplomats, agreed to speak about internal disputes anonymously.
Their statements were corroborated by a pro-administration analyst who remained anonymous.
Reading history
Another possible cover-up is the report by lawyer Robert Müller about Mr. Trump's obstruction of justice, which is now widely documented in the society's documents.
According to reports, Müller is also investigating the Trump campaign's collusion with Russia to attack our elections.
If Congress changes its ownership, Trump will be held accountable in this body, as he was preparing to meet with voters, and will ultimately face a jury of his colleagues.
There are many ifs, but I'm not talking about Mr. Trump's unbeatable win and the fall of his European equivalents.
We are going to have to make choices that will affect the timing of the fight on both sides of the Atlantic.
In 1938, if the West supported the Czechoslovaks in their resistance to Hitler, German officers were ready to overthrow him.
We lost and missed the chance to escape the terrible slaughter that followed.
History repeats itself in such a way that the endless march of democracy is accelerated or slowed.
Americans are experiencing such turning points in modern times.
What are we going to do if Trump releases Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the head of the Mueller investigation?
The newspaper reported that Rozenstein had trouble last year after suggesting that the president be secretly dismissed and assuming that he was unfit for office.
The Times report is not true", said Rozenstein.
"If the investigation of Brett Kavano, who was asked to do the new Federal Bureau of Investigation, is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed by the Supreme Court despite the coercion and false testimony, how do we respond?
And first of all, in a midterm election, do we vote for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not pass this test, democracy will have a long winter.
But I am confident that we will win, because I learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that occupied my country.
He survived, moved to America, and 60 years later, on Shabbat, sent me to light a candle on a table with a symbol of the swastika.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisner, a field research associate at the Brookings Institution, chairman of the Washington organization "Responsible and Ethical Citizens" and author of "The Last Palace: The Stormy Century of Europe in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Graham Dorran, a player of the "Rangers", welcomes the fight with the "Rapid" of Vienna with enthusiasm.
Earlier in the month, the Rangers finished the game with a scoreless draw against Villarreal in Spain, and now, on Thursday, they are preparing to face Vienna Rapids, with the chances of entering the Europa League group G if they beat the Austrians rising.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorran from making his first appearance, so we only saw him in the 2-2 loss to Villarreal, but he believes the Raiders will take advantage of that success and make even bigger gains.
"It's a good score for us, because Villarreal is a strong team", said the 31-year-old.
"We started the game with the idea of doing something, and we came out with the score.
We probably would have made more, but in the end the basic calculation may have been a fair result.
They were stronger in the first half, and we showed ourselves better in the second half.
Thursday is another big European night.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a very difficult game because our opponents scored high in the last game, but I hope with people who support us we can win.
Thinking about my injuries and the changes that have taken place at the club, last year has been really difficult, but I feel good about where I am now.
The team is in a good mood, they play with enthusiasm, they train.
I hope we can continue with the success we had last season".
Women lose sleep in the capital of Kazakhstan for fear of pension accumulation
Although the respondents were aware of the care they were receiving, very few spoke to their family members about it.
Half of the participants in the nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term surveillance.
Only about 10 percent of children are told about it.
"People want to be looked after by family members, but they don't do anything to talk about it", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
That's where we start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare for family care without expressing your wishes.
Work with your counselor and family members to discuss where and how to get help, as this choice can be an important factor in determining the price.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
The choice of financing for long-term supervision may include the traditional long-term supervision trachovac policy, a hybrid insurance policy to cover that cost, or a voluntary self-funded insurance policy (if you have the money).
Prepare your legal documents; avoid court disputes.
Get a health insurance card, so you can identify a trusted person who will take care of your health and if you can't communicate, the professionals will be able to fulfill your wishes.
Also, make a trust for your finances.
You will choose someone you trust to take care of your finances and, if you are incapacitated, to pay your bills.
Keep in mind the details: Imagine that your grandparent needs urgent medical attention and is in the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a preparedness plan.
"It's not just about financial indicators, what are the doctors like?" asked Martin.
"What kind of medicines?
Who's going to watch the dog?
Make a plan for that.
In Ilfracombe , a man fired several shots from a pneumatic rifle
On the way home in the evening, a man was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle.
The 40-year-old victim, Ilfracombe, suffered gunshot wounds to the chest, abdomen and arm while in the vicinity of Oxford Groov, Devon.
Officers described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 BST, as "a coincidence".
The victim did not see the shooter.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are asking witnesses for help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials say at least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the communication breakdown, the rescue workers could not get any information from the Donggala district, located north of Palo, near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palo after the disaster.
Some of the main facts about Palau and Donggala, located in Sulawesi:
Palou is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located in a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary with a major earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is an administrative district in northwest Sulawesi extending over 300 km (180 mi) along the coast.
In 2017, the administrative region of the province, the district, had 299,200 inhabitants.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstay of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of the Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Moralo, on the opposite bank of the Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, the island of Palau and the Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed more than a hundred homes.
In 1996, a tsunami occurred in the western part of the Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring and earthquakes occur regularly here.
The following are the most powerful earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake and tsunami hit the west coast of the Indonesian province of Achech, north of Sumatra, killing 226,000 people in 14 countries along the Indian Ocean - more than half of them Achechans.
2005: In late March and early April, a powerful earthquake struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake on the southern coast of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, causes a tsunami that kills about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurs near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami over 10 meters long, destroying dozens of villages and leaving about 300 people dead.
2016: A small earthquake in Achebe's Pidijaya district caused devastation and panic, as people recalled the devastating effects of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the destroyed buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists in a difficult situation.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was convicted of domestic abuse
Track Paynlin, the eldest son of Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Paynlin, was the prisoner responsible for the attack.
According to a report by the Alaska State Police released Saturday, 29-year-old Payn from Wausilla, Alaska, is suspected of domestic abuse, obstruction of a domestic abuse report and resisting arrest.
According to police reports, the woman confiscated her phone when she tried to call the police about the crimes.
Pэйлин was held in the Mat-Su detention center with $500 worth of unsecured bonds, reports KTUU.
On the Sabbath, he was brought before the court and asked to tell about his guilt.
Paynlin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also guilty of a class B felony, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It was not the first time that a criminal case was brought against Payn.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Payn.
His mother, Sarah Payn, called the police and reported the attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with assaulting a family, obstructing a report on domestic violence, and carrying a rifle while intoxicated.
His companion told her that he had hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Paynlin was criticized by a veteran group for associating her son's aggressive behavior with posttraumatic stress disorder due to his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquakes and tsunamis: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed more than a thousand homes.
Electric and communications networks are not functioning, and the number of dead is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck near Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
Videos showing the season of impact are circulating on social networks.
When the tsunami hit the shore, hundreds of people had gathered in the city of Palo to attend a beach festival.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
The New York federal prosecutor's office is seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, suspected of killing eight people in New York - a rare punishment that has not been used in the state since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov used a rented car Home Depot to attack a bike path along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and a cyclist.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "knew" to kill eight victims and "knowingly" inflicted substantial bodily harm, in an attempt to seek the death penalty imposed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty was possible in both of these points.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury indicted Saipovka on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, assault, destruction of a car, and aiding a racket used in a federal criminal case, which is usually organized by the prosecutor's office.
The prosecutor's office said the attack required "serious planning and indiscretion", and said the act was "spineless, brutal and immoral".
"Saipov has inflicted injuries, damages and damages to Diego, including to Enrique Andjelini, Nicholas Klivs, Ann-Lor Decadt, Darren Dreyck, Ariel Erlij, Ernan Ferручchi, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the last execution in the Southern District of New York.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug smugglers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal New York case was in 1953 to the family of Yulius and Ethel Rozenberg, who had been executed two years earlier for espionage against the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were electrocuted on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he did.
On the basis of the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to police, he also asked to hoist the flag of ISIS in the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
Saipov's defender, one of the federal public defenders, David Patton, said that he had "openly lost hope" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of a plea of guilty to life in prison without the possibility of parole will be very difficult for those involved in these events", said Patton.
The team of Saipov's defense pleaded with the prosecutor's office not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP thinks Brexit negotiations should be left to NAYDJEL FARAJA
Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference today.
The former leader of Ukip told his Eurosceptics that politicians "should feel warm" - because one of Theresa May's deputies suggested she talk to the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bon said at a march in Birmingham that Britain would stay out of the way if Mr. Faraj was the Brexit secretary.
But the problem of reconciling Mrs May's deeply divided ranks has led conservative Tories to join a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister fought for the implementation of the Checker compromise plan during the Brexit, anti-Brexit and EU attacks.
The Allies said he would try to negotiate with Brussels despite the rejection, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his package and "chaos".
Mr. Boun told Solihall that "to leave means to leave", telling the rally participants that he wanted to "leave Chechnya".
He said he needed to level the playing field and negotiate with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would go", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we need to get rid of Checker".
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying: "We did not fight the world wars for obedience.
We want to make our own laws in our country".
Bown rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: The idea that Britons had changed their minds and wanted to stay is completely untrue.
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins also told reporters at the march: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chechens are not popular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for them, they are not popular among our party and activists, they really are marching in the streets and seeking our election in the first place.
Please drop the Checks and start listening.
In his address to May, he added: "Prime ministers continue their work while keeping their promises".
According to Faraj, if the protesting politicians want to betray the 2016 referendum resolution, they should do it to "feel hot".
"Now we are talking about trust between the people and our political classes", he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and today we're going to say to them, 'We're not going to let you do that.'
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to feel the warmth of our political class on the verge of betraying Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave Brexit a victory, and we will not rest until we have an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, the opposing sides passed through Birmingham, after which they held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists have been arresting Tori anti-Brexit banners since the group began operating this week.
Labour's Lord Adonis ridiculed conservatives for the security problems faced by the party's app at the opening of the conference.
"These people tell us that they are going to deploy IT systems, that the technology that is left in Canada can be there for free trade, without limits in Ireland", he added.
This is just a farce.
There is no good Brexit", he added.
Warren is considering a presidential bid
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was "thinking deeply about her candidacy for president" after the November election.
As reported by Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future in western Massachusetts' mayoral race on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against Republican Representative Jeff Dilg, who was chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
He was at the center of rumors that he might be able to fight Trump in 2020.
He met with the mayor's voters for the 36th time since Trump took office in the city of Holyoke on Saturday afternoon.
The person who was present asked him if he was thinking of running for president.
Warren replied: "It's time for women to go to Washington to correct our broken government, including the women above".
The Sims Killer is captured
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported Saturday that a suspect in the murder of Louisiana State University basketball player Wade Sims has been arrested.
Police in Baton Rouge reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying the person in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot in the early hours of Friday morning outside the campus of Southern University.
"Wade Sims was shot in the head and ultimately died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
When Wade left his friend, Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned, admitted to carrying a weapon and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested by accident and detained by the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 198-inch-tall youngster grew up in Baton Rouge, where Sims played in 32 games of 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Team division helps Lewis Hamilton win the world title by defeating Sebastian Fettel
When Mercedes's Valtteri Bottas was ordered to push forward Lewis Hamilton at Saturday's race, it became clear that such a split would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start from the pole and defended his position in the first two turns and helped his teammate, but he did not attack Hamilton.
Fettel had entered one of the boxers, and Hamilton would have remained in the tail of the stream, thus making it a decisive moment.
Mercedes passed the first lap and came behind Fettel, but Hamilton, a bit behind the wheel, took the lead: thus the Ferrari driver, at double speed, pulled out of the third lap without risking losing control.
Max Ferстапpen started from the last row of the grid, and on his 21st birthday, he was seventh at the end of the first round.
Then I quickly reached the finish and Kimmi held the tyres for most of the race, hoping to take the fourth place of Raickkonen.
He finally entered the ring on lap 44, but as he was fourth, he was unable to increase his pace with eight laps remaining.
It was a very difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job over the weekend and helped me to turn around like a real gentleman.
"The team did a great job to get first and second", Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for telling her not to leave a letter that accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavano of rape.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly appeal to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead explained that the events in the Senate were "evil, vicious and deceitful".
"The only thing that can happen and the most remarkable thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is anger, people showing themselves as evil, vicious and deceitful", he said.
Looking at the releases and the classified information that was circulated, they say Ay-ay, I didn't do it.
I did not do that.
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you broadcast?
Remember the answer... Have you leaked classified information? - Yes, what?
Aye-aye, no.
It's not me.
Wait a minute.
We were... No we are not", he added, as the senator sensed.
A letter detailing the charges against Ford Kavano had been sent to Feinstein, and it was circulated to the public in September, but Feinstein denied leaving his office.
"I did not disseminate Dr. Ford's allegations, the incident", Feinstein told the committee, according to Zee Hill.
He asked me to keep confidentiality and I did.
But his refusal did not please the president, who commented during a Saturday night rally: "I tell you what, it was really bad body language.
Maybe it wasn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
While the three women continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate accused of the affair, the president believed the Democrats had used the charges to their advantage.
It is important to restore power by various means.
You see their evil, their cruelty, whoever they make it hard for, whoever they go through, they just want to take power and control".
Elite League: Dandi Stars 5: 3 Belfast Dжайантs
Patrick Duayer scored two goals in the match against Djiantz at Dundee.
The Dandi Stars recovered from their elite league defeat to the Belfast Giants on Friday, winning 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
Djiantz won the championship by two goals over Patrick Duayer and his strikes.
Before Duayer took the lead, Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooley were relegated to the home position.
Before Lucas Lundдваald Nilsen's two goals ensured their victory, François Buchar equalized the score in favour of Dandi.
In the Elite League, Adam Kiff's pupils suffered three defeats before winning 2-1 at Dundee on Friday night in Belfast.
This was the fourth meeting of the teams this season, the Giants having won three times before.
With the help of a pass from Kendal MacFol at 3:35, Duayer scored the first goal in the fourth minute with a goal from David Rutherford, and two minutes later, Bovillier doubled the lead.
During the strong opening, Sullivan entered the home leg at 13:10 with Matt Markwardt passing to Cooney to tie the game at 15:16.
When Duayer scored his second goal late in the first period, it was clear that the Djayants were leading the first half.
The owners regrouped and Buchar scored at 27:37, the majority of the team, again tied.
In the second period, Nielsen was joined by Cowney and Charles Corcoran to help lead Dundee, who won their team by five points during the final period.
The Giants, who have won four of their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at home against Milton Keynes.
More than 100 people have been saved by the earthquake
The Indonesian air dispatcher was given the title of hero for safely lifting the aircraft with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people died in the tsunami that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, and many others were missing.
Strong aftershocks continued in the area, leaving many people in the city of Palow unable to escape the ruins.
But despite saving the lives of his colleagues, 21-year-old Antony Guanavan refused to leave Agun Palu's heavily fortified dispatcher's outpost at Mutiara Siss Al-Jufri airport.
He remained on the spot to see if the 6321 Batik Air flight, which was on the runway at the time, could fly safely.
Dispatcher noticed that the visca was breaking down and jumped from it.
He later died in a hospital.
Indonesian Air Navigation spokesman Johannes Sirait said the move could save hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter from Baliqpapan to Kalimantan to take her to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died before the helicopter reached Pauli this morning.
"When we heard these things, our hearts were overwhelmed".
At the same time, the government fears the death toll could reach thousands, as the country's disaster mitigation agency reported that access to Donggala, Sihi and Butung was limited.
"The number of dead continues to rise, as most of the bodies are under the rubble, many are not reachable", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nuгрохо.
Waves of up to six metres crushed the Palu, which will be a burial ground on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft and supplies were brought.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, the ambulance brings a body.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarket is wrapped.
Jann Geльфand, head of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross has rushed to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palunga on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready? According to CNN report.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by a devastating earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian air disaster: Air Niugini says one person is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
An airline on a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia said one person was missing after it was reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been successfully evacuated from the sunken plane.
According to Air Niugini, the airline could not find a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local government, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the age or nationality of the passenger.
After the plane landed in the water, local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew.
Officials said seven people were hospitalized on Friday.
According to the airline, six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all of them are stable.
The cause of the accident and the true sequence of events remained unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane flew off the runway.
American passenger Bill Jeans described the plane going very low.
"That's very good", said Jane.
According to Jane's account, the water was up to his waist, so he and others were able to get to the emergency exit of the submerged plane.
He told of the panic and screams of the flight attendants and of his slight head injury.
According to the US Navy, sailors working nearby to improve the sea also assisted in the rescue, before the aircraft sank to a depth of 30 metres (100 ft).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in the PNG in the last two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugini.
Analyst shows chronology of the night of burning woman alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office based the case on a 2014 reconsideration of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Roullett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, used cell phone tapes to compile their movements together on the night of their death.
Roullett said that he had seen several cell phones showing that Chambers was with Tellis on the night of her death - information that contradicted his earlier reports, The Clarion Ledger.
The data showed that she was with Chambers on her cell phone, but Tellis said she was with her friend Michael Sanford; the police decided to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stated that he was not in town, saying that he had been speaking on Saturday.
When asked by prosecutors if it was true that Tellis was in Sanford's car, Sanford said: "She's lying because my car was in Nashville that night".
Another coincidence is that Telllis said she knew Chambers about two weeks after he died.
According to cell phone records, they had known each other for only a week.
Roullett said that some time after Chambers' death, Telllis deleted all of Chambers' messages, phone calls, and contact information from his phone.
"She washed him out of her life", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final argument on Sunday.
The judge said that he was waiting for the jury session on the same day.
The High Breed: What is sensible hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wanted to counter the negative attitude in the genre by filling their music with good news.
Bristol band The High Breed has been known to go beyond the origins of political messages and focus on social issues.
They want to go back to basics and consciously popularize hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a revival in the UK thanks to the likes of Akala and Lowki.
Another black man?!
A New York babysitter is being sued by her family for writing a racistic text
A New York babysitter who was fired from a discriminatory job after receiving a text message sent to her by a single parent, summoned the family to court, and the text read: This is another black person.
The family rejected the racist position, comparing the trial to "robbery".
When mother of two, Linsi Plasco-Flaxman, arrived on her new babysitter, Gisele Morris' first day of work in 2016, she was devastated to learn that she was black.
"WASHING, WASHING, WASHING" is a line from the song "A Black-Bodied Man" written by Linsi Plazko-Flaxman to her husband.
But instead of sending the text to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
Realizing his carelessness, the "uncomfortable" Placo-Flaxman fired Morris because their departing African-American worker had done badly and they were waiting for a Filipino woman instead, the New York Post reported.
They returned home with Uber, who paid Moris for a day's work.
Morris now sued the family for dismissal and, despite being uncontracted, initially sought $350 a day in compensation for the six-month house he had been hired to live in.
"I'm going to show them that it doesn't work like that", he told Post on Friday, adding, "It's discrimination".
The family responded by saying that they were racist, that it was the right thing to do to fire Maurice, because they were afraid that if they hurt him, we wouldn't trust him.
My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
He is not a racist.
We are not racist", her husband, Joel Placo, told the Post.
Would you give your children to someone who was cruel, even though you were alone?
The newborn?
You see".
Comparing the trial process to a "raiding", Plazko said that his wife was only two months from giving birth and that she was "in a very difficult situation".
Would you follow such a man?
This is not a very good job", the investment banker added.
The trial is still ongoing, and the public court quickly sentenced the couple via social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers say they won't accept the bad news readers are talking about
After the book was accepted, the Bond girl Karen Yankeel wrote: It is difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who read this book for the first time before it was published.
It is interesting to know about the great successes of Paddington now".
She said she was optimistic about being turned down for a job before her father's little toy bear inspired her to write a children's book, saying she was "very sad" that it was 60 years since the book was published, because last year it had sent her father to the end.
She called Paddington "a very important member of our family", and her father added that he was quietly proud of her achievements.
"He was a very quiet, unpretentious man", she said.
Maybe Paddington was real to her, like a successful child: you're proud, but your part isn't here.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his dream, he gave Paddington the proper credit".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye by telephone
When she fell to the ground, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2nd Hospital - where doctors tried to save her life.
"Ned called me several times to tell me that he was in a very bad condition and that they could not help him", Ednan-Laperoz said.
"Then Ned called me, saying that he was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I said goodbye.
I said: Tashi, my daughter, I love you very much.
See you soon.
I will be with you.
The medications prescribed by doctors to keep the heart functioning were slowly being exhausted and his body was leaving.
Soon after, she died, and all that ended.
Knowing that this was happening, I had to sit back and wait.
I could not cry, cry out, or scream because I was with my family and people.
I really shouldn't have left.
At the last moment, Mrs. Ednan-Lapperuz, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with all the passengers, and forgot about the trials she had passed.
"No one knew", he replied.
I bowed my head, and tears came down my eyes.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt compassion for Ned.
She needed my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much.
Postcards from grieving women to prevent suicide in print
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide try to help others avoid suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries placed postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to call for help on the Wales Bridge.
Davis' son Tyler suffered from depression at age 13 and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want parents to feel the same way I do every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, a 45-year-old resident of Lydney, told me that her son was a promising chef with a hearty smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
Everyone said that his smile lit up the room".
However, he left his work before his death, for he was "in the darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found the body after his brother committed suicide.
Davis said: "I'm sad every day that it's going to have some kind of strong impact.
Although Davis was friendly, he made postcards to let people know if there were people he could talk to.
Do not be silent and talk".
Mrs. Humphries, who had been friends with Davis for many years, lost her 15-year-old boyfriend Mark shortly after her mother's death.
And he said, He hath told him of his troubles, and of his visions, and he told him not.
A few days before Christmas, we saw how his attitude changed.
It was like he was the best on Christmas Day - when he opened the children's presents he didn't even look at them".
Her death was a great heartache for them, but they must overcome it: "It's a rift in this family.
That's what separates us.
But we all have to keep going and fight".
If you struggle to overcome this, you can call Samaritans on 116 123 (UK and Ireland), write to jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritans website.
Brett Kavano's future hangs in the balance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation begins its work
"I thought if we could get what he asked for - time-limited, limited investigation - we could bring some kind of interconnection", Flayk said on Saturday, expressing his fear of a "tarka" against the backdrop of the end of the committee's entrenched partisanism.
Why did Kavano and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance was due to time.
With only five weeks to go before the midterm elections on November 6 - and if the Republicans behave badly, they are expected to weaken their efforts to accept a candidate for the country's highest court.
Kavanaugh worked for George W. Bush at the White House and through Bush, met his current wife, Ashley, who was Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI reports?
Elections are currently held in the Senate, which is made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet known whether Kavano will be able to garner at least 50 votes in the Senate chamber, which will allow Vice President Mike Peska to stop the plot and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean refugees under Kim plummeted
The South Korean deputy said that since Kim Jong-un came to power, the number of North Korean refugees arriving in South Korea has decreased.
According to the Southern Integration Ministry, Pak Byon Sook reported that there were only 1127 refugees last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Pak said that the main factors are the strengthening of border control between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs for smugglers.
Pyongyang did not provide any explanation to the public.
Most of the people from the North were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Many of them pass more easily through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, than the well-guarded demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them by force.
The North and South were still at war, but their relations had improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on denuclearization.
This came after the historic June meeting of US presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to build a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yongho blamed the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"If there is no trust in the United States, we will not have national security, and in such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm", Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and declared him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavano "hysterical" and expressed his temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview with the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't imagine that if she behaved like this, they would call her hysterical", Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavano's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kawano emotionally denied the allegations that Dr. Kristin Bэйzik had raped Ford in her youth.
In the opening words, Kavano was very emotional, sometimes screaming, and in agony, he told about his family and school years.
He also consistently denounced the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "a vicious and coordinated assassination" - which he said was organized by liberals dissatisfied with Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi thought that Kavanaugh's testimony showed his opposition to the Democrats, and therefore he could not serve on the Supreme Court.
"I think he's being disqualified by the way he's referring to the Clintons and the Democrats with these kinds of messages", she said.
Pelosi objected to the question of whether Kavanaugh would be impeached if confirmed, and whether the Democrats would win a majority in the House.
"I'm saying - if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he shouldn't be in the Supreme Court, not just the court that we have now", Pelosi said.
Kavano is currently a judge on the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about potential decisions by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe Wedd, who was considered a conservative judge.
At the ratification hearings, Kavano did not answer questions about whether he had rejected certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and say 'Everything is fine,'" Pelosi said.
Women should have it too.
This fair diatribe, angry months and years, she could not take away without weeping.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that simple, is it?"
She continued: "One woman who worked as a manager helped me a lot, she also cried when she got angry, but when she got angry and started crying, she used the technique of telling this guy, she said, 'You might think that when I cry, it's hard for me too.
I'm getting mad.
And then he goes on.
I think that's amazing.
Due to the lack of explanation, tears were allowed as a partial opening.
One of the most memorable moments of my male-dominated office work was when I was crying with unspeakable rage, and an older woman caught me - a cold boss - I was always a little afraid - and dragged me into the carriage.
"Then he told me, 'Don't let anyone know you've been crying.'
They don't know you're angry.
They will think you are sad and they will be happy, because they have been able to drop you.
At the time, Democratic congresswoman Patricia Schröder of Colorado served with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, after Mr. Hart had been caught in an extramarital affair on board the ship Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the race, Mrs. Schröder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she should not consider becoming president and participating in the election.
"It was a thoughtless decision", he joked to me 30 years later.
There were seven candidates in the race, and none of them needed to be nominated.
Some called it "Belarus and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was late, he was behind in raising money, so he vowed not to compete unless he collected $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave men $1,000 only gave him $250.
"Do they think they're going to get a discount?" he thought.
When he announced that he would not participate in the official campaign, he felt the same way - gratitude to those who supported him, despair from the system of fundraising and attracting voters' attention, no delegates, and exposure to sexism - he gasped.
"You'd think I was nervous", said Schröder of the press' reaction to him.
"You think of Kleenex as my corporate donor.
What are they planning to put on my grave?
He is a country?
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the US-China trade war were sound, and that the confrontation between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, even though the war is not over yet.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by levying taxes on China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (150 billion euros) worth of goods, with half of all goods entering the United States from China effectively taxed.
Beijing has always responded in the same way: recently it increased tariffs of five to ten percent on goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has promised to stay with the United States, and the second-largest economy on earth is unlikely to disappear any time soon.
Limiting Washington means yielding to demands, but it would be very uncomfortable for Chinese President Xi Jinping to publicly worship the United States.
But experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, the U.S. trade war pressure could provide China with good long-term support, reducing the interconnectedness of the two economies.
"If a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create economic conditions in different countries, then observers will be much more dangerous", said Ebigel Grace, an Asia researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria is "ready" to return refugees
Syria is reportedly ready for the free return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mugalim noted the improvement in conditions in the country.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continued to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal life.
Due to the terrorism and the economic measures against daily life and way of life, all conditions are now created for the voluntary return of refugees.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million people have fled Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people in need of humanitarian assistance live in the country.
Al-Mugalim said the media would support the Syrian regime in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he made it clear that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had supported the attackers.
Paris won the Ryder Cup in Europe
In 2018, the European team won the Ryder Cup held in Paris, France at the Le Golf National, defeating the USA team by a score of 16,5-10,5.
The U.S. lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The Danish captain Thomas Bjorn won the European crown after his team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the USA.
US star Phil Mikelson, struggling for most of the tournament, entered the ball in the 3rd pair of the 16th hole, thus winning the match over Francesco Molarinari.
Italian golfer Molinairi has shone through all of his tours, with the current tournament format since 1979 being 1-4 players going 5-0-0.
American Jordan Smith lost to the lowest ranked player of the European team, Denmark Torbjern Olesen, 5-4 in the final.
World's best player Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to England's Jan Pulter, who had last played in the Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the best winner of the European Tour with a career-high 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It was a difficult year.
I want to thank Thomas for choosing me and for trusting me.
I am very happy, very happy with the return of the cup.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to be able to help", Garcia said emotionally after winning in Europe.
He handed the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who had defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in the singles on Sunday.
"I'm proud to win Tiger Woods because I grew up watching this guy", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods won all four matches in France and now holds the Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, having won 14 major titles, not only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team tried to find the ferveys over the weekend, with Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finals remaining, who had played top-level golf at the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance of the team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
Today was a time when Europe was somewhat warmer in the morning.
We were given.
I took off my hat in front of Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will unite, we will work with the American Ryder Cup Committee, we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to serve as captain.
You have to do your job.
We were defeated".
