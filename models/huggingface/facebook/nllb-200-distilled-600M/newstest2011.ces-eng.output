The CSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or the sugar factory.
The new city councils of the CFSP will apparently have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their former colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and the House of Representatives.
The members of the new Council of the CZSSD "tested" the notoriously established slang that has emerged in the city hall during the last years when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, introduced by the Prague political cremation during the previous era of the mayor Pavel Beme, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, the new councilman doesn't understand the familiar concepts.
At least he says so.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know".
"I'm a newcomer to Prague politics", said the cultural adviser, Lukáš Kautsky, when asked about the "Kmotra" dictionary.
Although he was a political veteran, councillor Karel Březyn reacted similarly.
Like the term "golf pit".
"It's the only expression you've ever given me that I use occasionally".
"I don't generally recognize slang otherwise".
From the dictionary, which Aktuálně.cz published in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial board selected six examples, mostly those notoriously linked to the Prague city hall.
The Socialists were supposed to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the biggest golf pit in Prague", "go to the candy store", "bull's neck", "betrayal of the capital" and "crying".
Three council members agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who will be the future head of Prague's education - first promised an interview, but later did not answer the phone.
Fifth Councillor Petr Dolínek has just turned down the test.
"I'm not going to solve these things at all, and I'm not going to judge the way the citizen democrats have fun".
"I'm now dealing with how we're going to get along in our programs", he replied.
As already mentioned, the councillor Lukáš Kaucký would not have recognised in the title above that the speaker was an influential businessman and friend of the expressionist Bém Roman Janoušk.
"Voldemort" tells Kaukki nothing, and the only term he correctly estimated on the test is "the biggest golf pit in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel", says Kaucký, and immediately adds, "but I know it more from the newspapers".
"I'm going to have to pay for some language course", he jokes.
The golf pit is now being deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březín, but also by the environment minister, Lukas Pchachy.
Both Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is, and Lucas Plaché is also familiar with where to find this character - he knows the meaning of the phrase "go to the candy store".
"I mean, go to some Prague business", is a shy close to dissolution that's the headquarters of the Janush companies.
He recalls, as does Brescia, that he learned from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the test frequencies, there is no such obsolete dictionary of slang terms.
"I've consulted with colleagues, but we don't seem to have any".
"We prefer to call ourselves names, sometimes abbreviations and abbreviations are used", says the chairman of the Prague SSR, Petr Hulínský, nicknamed Hulda by his party.
"I was called Briesas at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that", confesses Karel Bresin, who goes by his nickname.
The newspaper Actualmente.cz has tried the name and it works.
The councillor Weinert is a party-friendly grandfather or less so, the deputy Miroslav Poche, who has been accused of party sponsorship fraud before the election, is nicknamed "Games" by some colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only thing the Social Democrats allow in their domestic speech.
Hulda is not heard by Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz has also recorded another nickname for the Prague president.
The "Doctor of Law" is said to recall that Petr Hulínský obtained his JUDd. degree from the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to curb the torture of "witches", issued a brochure
The women declared witches in Burkina Faso have several characteristics in common.
They are more of an older generation, unable to work, for example, for health reasons, unmarried and childless.
The one who becomes a witch is sent to isolation to avoid endangering the rest of the village.
"A man's fate is very seldom reached".
"Even young healthy women are not married because they help with work and give birth to children", describes a nun who cares for more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities in a special home in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measures".
She's issued a newsletter that should help curb the witch hunt.
It's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read", noted Die Standard, a daily newspaper, on the disadvantage of literacy.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which borders Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmah, 70, died last week after being tortured, fuel-fed and burned by three women and two men.
The BBC server reported the case.
The perpetrators claim that it was an unfortunate coincidence of circumstances.
According to their version, the woman was given an oil used for ritual anointing.
He was reported to have started after the group tried to "exorcise the evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is promoted by people regardless of their level of education.
The Daily Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "The consummation of human souls has always been a danger".
While the government in Burkina Faso is trying to mitigate the witch hunt, the president himself was present in The Gambia last year.
"The Gambian president, Jammi, after the death of his aunt, launched an extensive witch hunt, allegedly to have been involved in her death and to have attempted to kill the president himself with black magic".
"He called for help from shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's personal security, forcibly escorted randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president's farm in Kanilai", Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, prisoners were forced to drink herbal medicine with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners didn't survive their stay on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly 1,000 prisoners were finally released.
The bachelor's tenant: Sink in the rocks, higher rent signed
An elderly man walked through the door of the RPG client center of the house of "coal baron" Zdenek Bakaly, the largest private rental property owner in the Czech Republic.
He's carrying a file with new leases for three apartments: his own, his daughter's, and his son, who's serving his sentence.
All three of them just got their rent raised.
Instead of 3500 a month, the son will pay 4100 crowns for a 2+1 second-class apartment from next year.
"And there is no warm water and the petram must be melted", the man points with his finger to his son's new covenant, which he has full authority to sign.
"But I signed it", he explains half angry and half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which has described the new lease terms as 'inappropriate and immoral', advises tenants not to sign the new contract and to wait until 7 December to publish instructions on how to proceed against it.
But the man just waves his hand over it.
"One says it, the other says it", he blurred.
Ostrava is becoming a major deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments in the Czech Republic are still rented.
Currently.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The Havirov RPG waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and is already full on Tuesday at 9am.
Right next to the door is a security guard with a call machine.
"Lease 2011", a special button on his touchscreen lights up.
One touch and a numbered paper comes out of the machine.
You don't even get to read "157" and your number is already ringing on the big screen under the ceiling of the waiting room.
You'll be in half a second.
An elderly couple comes to ask for rent after a while, but the waiting room's bustle is obviously not about the new rent.
Most people have come to deal with common problems like they used to - repair requests, insurance incidents, and the like.
Letters with new leases have been received in Ostrava's mailboxes by tenants of most of the RPG portfolio's 44,000 apartments since mid-November.
RPG houses in their letters suggest a 15 to 38 percent increase in rent.
A special barrier to new rents was opened at the client centre on 18 November.
"It's been going on for over a week, so it's only a matter of time", respond the waitress after a moment's hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and the former Bacala mining apartments are a hot topic in the area.
Before the election, he was grabbed quite swiftly by the deputy speaker of parliament and the Ostravian native Lubomír Zaorálek of the CSSD, and even now the local newspapers are full of him.
"Twenty years after that, I want a new floor".
"Neither did the...the other plate in the bathroom", the man mentioned in the introduction relieves himself.
Most of the time, according to the workers, retirees come to see if they can get a rent discount if they sign in on time as the RPG promises them in the special offer.
Half-a-day discount on the February rent, and other tenants who sign a new contract by December 15.
The Havre "deregulation" barrier, however, is definitely not filled in.
"Of the 360 clients hired yesterday, only about 40 to 50 were hired in 2011", estimate the workers behind the barrier.
RPG, on the web and on its walls, suggests individual contract negotiation wherever needed.
However, if the rental is not agreed by both parties, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and fully legitimate legal process", RPG warns on its website.
"No one will be judged here", one of the RPG workers at the apartment thinks, and a man on the street outside the client center gives her a partial statement.
"I have a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left to eat, I don't deserve to be judged", he says.
But the worker will find out after a while.
"We'll see".
"Mr. Zaoralek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting", he thinks.
Rental regulations will end in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, an increase in rent is an economic necessity.
'The existing rent is still not even up to the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund,' recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of RPG Byty's residential portfolio, who said that the main reason for the increase in rent was the neglect of the housing fund, which the angry tenant accused of.
While RPGs could have invested $4 billion in rental properties in the five years between 2005 and 2010, over the four years between 2011 and 2014, that figure is expected to be $5.2 billion.
Meanwhile, the large screen hanging from the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the Havre waiting room repeats some red-colored information.
"The 2011 rental increase of 15% and less is for 31,200 apartments, that's more than 90% of RPG apartments".
"And it's always going to be at most $7.50 per square foot and a month", appears on the screen.
Only 400 RPG-portfolio apartments will see a 38 percent increase in rent.
"In these cases, the increase is from an extremely low amount of 19,66 CZK per square metre", notes RPG.
The 2,600 apartments will be the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation won't drive rent-to-rents but will be spread out over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) will be returned to the company's apartments, mainly for heat savings - new windows and heating.
They're primarily to be obtained by people who sign a lease agreement.
The office includes a kindergarten, the architects understood.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect it to also cover a mini-school with everything that goes with it - colorful walls, fancy furniture, a bunch of toys, and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, it has been open to children of Arch.Design employees.
The architectural and design company Arch.Design, whose studios produced a number of important Brno buildings, has been counting on space for its business mini-school since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs nearly 90 people, mostly in the baby boom, and it was concerned that women designers and architects could get back to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of reduced hours, the preschool is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees under the social programme.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine the demanding work of child care.
The mini-school was conceived by the staff of Arch.Design and with the support of the management, they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company mini-school is financed from the European Social Fund through the Human Resources and Employment Operational Programme and the Czech State Budget.
The grant funding (Czech Republic's grant of CZK 2,8 million) allowed them to purchase equipment and equipment and to provide qualified staff and operations for two years.
After the financial subsidy has been exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to operate a mini-school at its own expense for 3 years.
The project took one year to prepare and was a major aid to Economy Rating in the grant application.
The childcare is provided by qualified staff, and the children are cared for by a nurse and a teacher of the school on a daily basis, so children can attend the school without age restrictions, but most of them are over 3 years old.
Since this is a "mini-school", there can be only five children present at the same time, but there are more in attendance during the day.
The operation of the daycare centre is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the daycare centre regardless of the hierarchy of positions in the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme load in a mini-school is comparable to the pre-school framework programme.
Children not only play here but also receive a quality education - from basic knowledge to preparation for school seating, English is taught.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys, stimulated games, but also with a computer that the children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check on their child at any time and avoid stressful situations with late pickup from schools away from the parents' workplace.
This makes parents more productive with their working hours.
No wonder loyalty between employee and employer is naturally established.
Arch.Design has thus been ranked among Czech companies that offer a significant benefit in hiring new employees, are family-friendly and through this programme has strengthened personnel marketing.
The house of bones is still fascinating after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of an ancient lizard, the stairs resemble the back of a dinosaur, and the balconies are open with fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
The local house earned its nickname, the House of Bones, because of its organic shapes.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade reminiscent of sheaves and ubiquitous soft curves, all are typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The roof of the house is played with dream lines, delicate colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
With close observation, geometry, rhythm and a well-thought-out order are visible.
At night, the entire facade of the house is made even more dramatic, illuminated to enhance the impression of the brightness of the colors.
The curvature and curvature of shapes are also found in interiors.
The wood in the waves copies window frames, rails, decorative elements of doors, hooks, and leaves.
The Batlló House, located in the Eixample district on Passeig de Gracia shopping street No. 43, was built in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, a wealthy industrialist named Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of Antoni Gaud did not design by himself.
He was the collaborator of architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his design board that the decorations for the property owner's representative apartment and the use of mosaics on the facade were created.
A number of other artists and creators worked on the facade.
The joint work on the Casa Batlló designs started a successful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol was involved in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá and Güell Park, which houses other works by Gaudí.
From the time the house was completed, the local people nicknamed it the "House of Bones" because of its organic shapes.
Others called it "the living house" because of its specific window opening mechanism.
It is also said that the top of the building depicts the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motifs also include other sculptural elements.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for his home at the time with ventilation ducts and typical chimneys.
Strange, their 45-degree inclination may seem.
When Gaudí created, he absolutely disrespected the building codes of his time and did not let them bind him.
At the beginning of construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, when the project was completed, the city council was horrified by the result and asked for a correction.
For example, the council was troubled by the fact that the building interfered with the pillars and the public sidewalk.
On the contrary, the amendment was never made: only 15 days after the call of the city, Josep Batlló applied for (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two tallest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
The second floor gallery had a social room and the third floor had a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented by a jewellery store.
The entire six-story house runs through the stairs leading up to the roof terrace itself.
The basic elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social section can be fully connected by opening the living room door and the larger company can communicate comfortably together without keeping the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, renovated by Gaudí, has been given a new facade and an unconventional roof and two additional floors.
Also impressive is Gaudí's play with light, the blue and white glazed tiles that cover the inner courtyard, and the lights.
A two-color game provides maximum lighting across all floors of the house.
Simply put, white reflects more light than dark, which absorbs sunlight.
The Casa Batlló, which was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, is open to all.
On the first floor of the house, the most spacious and most prestigious apartment is open to the public.
The owners decided to take this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the inspections as they found that this was a very advantageous undertaking and further expanded the inspections to include common and attic spaces, including roof terraces.
The entrance fee to the monument is certainly not negligible, it is 16,50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and tourist pass holders have a 20% discount.
The amount is well above the price of entrance to other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the true atmosphere of a dragon tower house, you must quickly befriend one of the tenants of the shed and visit him at home.
How to choose mattresses and grills: Women have different requirements than men
Not the bed frame, but the quality of the bed surface, the mattress and grill, are the foundation for a really good bed.
However, they must be harmonised to suit the specific user.
The choice depends on a number of factors, from weight, height, age, health status, and sex.
The type of interior into which the mattress and grill are placed is also important.
A typical example?
Latex mattresses are not suitable for weekend huts where people bathe regularly because they heat up more slowly.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
However, it is necessary to rotate them regularly.
If they don't have many exhaust ducts in the core and they're still on a hard board, they retain moisture.
It's also custom that determines the choice.
Those who have spent longer periods abroad, where very high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will find it hard to feel comfortable on a low, hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they couldn't sleep here".
"They needed a mattress with a softening layer of sluggish foam to support their stretched shoulders, legs, and hips".
"These are recommended even for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder and are so misinterpreting 'information' from the joints and skin", explains Sylva Hadamczik, a specialist in savory furniture.
Many hockey players, as well as other customers, were given a foam mattress years ago.
"It's fine now, the mattress is Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico".
You don't have to be an NHL fighter to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its hardness and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapted to your warm body.
Nothing's pushing you, you're not gonna turn around like a hard-fought game at night.
You'll just sleep better.
The foam also acts as a protection against overtaking.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of the foot, usually about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman, about 180 cm tall, need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for the two beds, which is 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example for singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For convenience and possible visitation.
"The rule of bed width is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly bent in the elbow", advises Ing. Helena Prokop, a master of the craft and decorator's guild, who has been teaching in professional schools for many years on the subject of healthy sleep and furniture ergonomics.
Each one needs its own grill and mattress for a double bed, but be careful when buying to adjust the height of the mattress.
Otherwise, you can only mount the grids to different heights, but you may not be able to do that in every frame of the bed.
The foam mattress should be at least 14 cm high, with a brush-shaped frame of at least 15, of which at least 3 cm for the molding and baking layers.
"When you touch your hands or sit on a mattress, you definitely must not feel the springs", warns Helena Prokop.
Every mattress requires a certain type of grille.
A full-roofed bed, with mattresses and underpants like big Siamese twins, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
Mattresses are badly winded, and they can't be washed, which is common today.
And since we usually sweat 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat at night, it's clear that after five to seven years, the mattress will start to look like a big (and clogged) net.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans that suggest mattresses can last up to 25 years or even a lifetime guarantee.
But everything has its own ways.
And that's why the salesman's practical advice: For a mattress that is 120 or 140 centimeters wide, do not give up on the hygiene and work-stamped coating, but rather add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and clean.
Although mattresses are commonly made today, they are spread all over the circuit, so when you unpack, you get two parts (which is very important for the laundry and the size of the washing machine!), yet the manipulation of larger types (and one person) could be a bit like a lightweight struggle in a ring with a heavy one.
Do you have a hard disk in your bed instead of a grill?
I never did!
Maximum bed for one night visits.
However, if the board is no longer there, provide it with ventilation holes and use a mattress with a spring frame and a height of at least 15 cm with a bag of springs (Taschenfederkern) and a layer of sausage.
Polyurethane mattresses don't fit into that kind of foundation.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (such as a combination of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-woven lamella grills with 14 to 18 lamellae, but you will always benefit from grills with a larger number of lamellae, 28 or more, where the lamellae in the bearing area are doubled and their hardness can be regulated.
The positioning lamel grids are not covered by the brush-shaped mattress because they do not react to the positioning.
In addition to the hardness of the lamel, the so-called shoulder strap can be added.
It is a special grip that allows the lamella to be pressed or even tilted to make the shoulder feel good.
For men with shoulders all over their backs, that's a big deal.
Even mattress manufacturers remember her, who in the "women's" began using the softening zone just around the shoulders.
They also remember women - they are given a softer surface in the hip places.
For the most demanding customers, wingspan or plate grids with so-called multi-turn grinding are provided.
The pressure decreases to several points and the voltage decreases.
However, be careful, once you use the right mattress and grill the wrong pillow (large and "forced"), most "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and only touch the shoulders with the tips to relax the shoulder muscles.
The recommended size is 50 x 60 cm, which is preferred, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be level (along with the shoulder strap or the softened zone in the mattress) with the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original straw-filled lawn.
Their producers are increasingly using natural materials or at least mixtures.
The trend is just the mattress bio.
The raw materials of the oil from which polyurethane foams are made are replaced by natural oils, such as hops and soybeans.
It's the kind of soybean that's used by all the famous producers.
"Bio in mattresses means that the core is made of a material of pure natural origin", explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress straps, with aloe vera being one of the first.
But you can also take microcapsules to release the fresh scent of forest or lavender.
There's a split between men and women.
While a man is "cooled" by a plant extract from his belly to absorb heat and cool his body, a woman's clothes are "swept".
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, so the weaker sex is warmer.
Favorite of the day?
The mattress made of cold foam (has larger pores with a broken cell structure, is therefore more durable than regular polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
Combining the different hardness of cold foam and "thin" foam, they create a multi-zone mattress that knows exactly where to put its head, hips, and paws.
You'll pay from seven thousand crowns and above for a good mattress.
Those that meet the health criteria have a lower VAT rate and are considered health aids.
Gumotex was the first to achieve this advantage in the Czech Republic.
Saving on a mattress and grill is not easy.
Sometimes, for example, the actions of manufacturers or vendors offering two mattresses for the price of one can be used.
For example, Magniflex offers Duofreeze mattresses with all memory foam in a drawer for 11,990 crowns.
The second one is now available for free.
Tempur's material set in motion an era of sluggish, or viscoelastic, foams with an open cellular structure and high density at a "cosmic" pace.
It originally came about as a NASA material because astronauts were exposed to enormous overload when they were launched.
Temperature softens in the heat, but solidifies in the cold.
It adapts perfectly to the warmth of the human body and optimally distributes its pressure.
It is therefore ideal for preventing bedbugs, but also for increasing sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for medical products, such as special underfoot cushions that lighten the legs and the vascular system.
For example, domestic producers use Eucatherm C foam, Twinsaver foam and the like.
People tracking devices are increasingly needed by parents to keep an eye on their children.
The fear of having a child is making more and more people think of GPS surveillance.
The system originally designed to search for cars can also track people's movements, helping in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Annika Janatko.
The device is about the size of a cheese box, but soon it may be only as big as a watch.
Many people were frightened by the disappearance of Annika and began to question how to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that this is not a spy, but another way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy", says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the Czech market's leading suppliers of surveillance equipment.
"I admit that in some cases, such devices may be misused, for example, when they are put in a bag for someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case".
"Mostly, customers actually buy it for security reasons", Pilin added.
He believes that a child should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dan Bockova points out that if a child doesn't want to wear anything like that, they'll just get rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity in how to deliberately lose things when they don't want to be in control".
"They used to have high expectations for parents, but they can be turned off like these tracking devices", says Bočková.
She also said it was questionable whether such a facility would actually help in the event of an attack.
"In the case of a premeditated kidnapping, the perpetrator will almost always make sure that the child has no electronics with him that could reveal his location".
"Now it's a phone".
"As they begin to expand their tracking devices, they will look for them, too, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising".
"In such cases, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police", says the psychologist.
However, it admits that similar devices can help in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and passengers, even if the tracking device is destroyed immediately after an attack, its presence can help.
'The device may be set to dispatch the position periodically after a certain period of time.'
'If it is damaged, at least the last location of the person concerned shall be available.'
"The more expensive devices have built-in tilt meters, so even if a person slips and remains motionless, the device will immediately send a position-specific warning", says Czech.
He says that a similar service can be provided by navigation smartphones, which can also upload special software.
The problem with current tracking devices is that they are either devices similar to wax box-sized hangers or smaller mobile phones.
They're always at risk of losing them.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, a device that looks like a regular digital watch is being tested.
"It would have the greatest advantage that the potential aggressor may not have to know the tracking device at all".
"Or he'll only know them after a while, and that could give the police extra time", he adds.
Whether they develop tracking devices into bracelets or hangers, they'll still use the same technology used to monitor cars.
It is a combination of GPS positioning (used by regular car navigation) and a mobile phone function that reports the current position of the vehicle.
The army has fire ropes that would have turned the Czech Republic upside down, but they'll only last two years.
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of ropes to detonate the mines.
Last year, the Department of Defense delivered 224 kilometers of rope to the warehouse.
The army has stocks for 225 years.
The problem is, the rope's life span is two, four years at most.
The army bought the fire ropes from the STV Group, a.s. for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff, justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of fire cord, wrote off the MF DNES that the troops use 60 kilometers of firewood per year for training.
However, it is clear from the calculations of the military firefighters that MF DNES has addressed that all generals, army commanders, secretaries and cleaning staff would then have to undergo a very intensive firefighting training every year.
The Minister of Defence, Alexander Vondr, and the Army Commander, Vlastimila Picka, are not excluded.
That's the only way to justify the army's annual consumption of 60 kilometers of fireworks.
This length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were, the army's stockpile would last more than a decade.
If, on the contrary, the experts say that a minimum of two metres of fire rope is sufficient for the basic training of each new professional, the army has secured, through fresh purchases, even with increased consumption of wedding or special units, supplies for the 225 years mentioned.
The soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade recently complained to Minister Vondrov that they have almost no ammunition in their handguns, so they are also limited in shooting for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't even mind that they buy so many lighters from us over and over again".
"But it's their decision, and they know what they're going to get".
"For us, the military is a good customer, and we as traders try to serve it", says Jan Děcký, business manager of STV Group.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek justifies hundreds of kilometers of purchased ropes by saying that the military will have stockpiles of this "munition" for at least 10 years.
Jan Děcký of STV Group, however, only talks about four years of lighter life and police or military firefighters even two years.
"In perfect storage, the four can be", says one of them, who, as a soldier, refuses to reveal his name because of military criticism.
After the war has ended, each ammunition must be carefully tested for reliability and safety.
But these tests are not free and cost extra money.
Another argument the department makes is a quantitative discount on 445 kilometers of fire ropes.
"We were 60 percent less than last year's supply of 2,444 kilometers", explains a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense buyer's statement.
For comparison, the annual consumption of firearms by police firefighters who dispose of World War II or post-Soviet munitions does not exceed 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only enough ammunition to be consumed before they die.
It has been proven safe for firefighters, and it can also be more flexible in obtaining more modern and therefore more reliable types of rope.
The Ministry of Defense is already having considerable trouble disposing of tens of thousands of tons of warsaw pact-era ammunition when the 27,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to move to the Rhine.
The Czech firemen MF DNES has approached have the same problem in a few years: they will eliminate hundreds of kilometres of old lighters that today "cheap" buy.
To this day, I draw on the contacts I've gained through the competition.
The winning spot in the "Property of the Year" contest helped Lucas Pytloun sell the franchise to his hotel.
Last year's winner of the Livestock of the Year was the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberce.
His success story is like a movie.
Luke likes to travel.
And abroad, he realized there was a lack of quality accommodation in Libera at a reasonable price.
With savings from foreign brigades and a bank loan, he bought a half-destroyed five-story house.
It was a great courage to think that he was a third-year college student.
"The quality-price ratio at our place today has not given me reason not to try", says Lukas Pytloun.
The first apartment renovated began to be rented to foreign workers.
He put all the profits back into a house he gradually converted into a 54-bed boarding house.
Since then, in seven years of business, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels in Libera with a total capacity of over 300 beds for all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of these was the four-star Pytloun design hotel until recently.
But this year, he's added another one of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel on the island of Tisa, where we sold our franchise concept and other interested customers of the Pytloun hotel franchise are reporting", says last year's No. 1 businessman.
"And the winner of the Livestock of the Year competition was a big part of the sale of the hotel's license", Pytloun added.
His victory brought him greater fame and popularity in and around Liberty.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulating me, and I must say, it was nice", she recalls.
I definitely recommend the contest to anyone who's trying to do something.
It's not even necessary to win, every appearance is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances he might not otherwise have.
"I began to trade regularly with some of the competitors I met".
He said that the fame of success has affected every employee.
And he's in his 70s.
"I see more loyalty and pride in them for being involved in something that has gained universal recognition".
"It's not just my personal achievement, it's the result of the good work we all do together".
"Only my name is put on the front", says Luke Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a calmer year than we had at Farmett.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
But thanks to the winner's determination, Farmet has worse times.
Last year, the owner of Farmet, Karel Žďárský, won first place in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition.
The jury then appreciated the efforts by which he built a turnover of 100 million from a small tool shop in Česká Skalice.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me but all my colleagues and has given us confidence to compete", says the winner of last year's competition today.
Early in Farmet's history, there was a desire to do something useful.
So when the state offered to hire Karl Žďárský's father a small workshop as compensation for Communists' confiscated property, he did not hesitate for long, rejecting a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his father, they started a plastic bathroom company.
Soon after, they began to specialize in the use of herbal oil.
After 18 years, it has become the largest automaker in Central Europe.
The company has gained greater awareness among the general public after its success in the media competition.
"Not only did our customers start to perceive Farmet much better, but foreign partners also started to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in their country", says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, however, Farmett was not just a sign of triumphal euphoria.
The valuation was based on the company's economic performance up to 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And 2009 was the hardest year for the sales of engineering products.
The crisis was at its peak, and the citizens had not yet been so affected, but companies were already halting their investment projects and restricting purchases of new machinery and technology.
"Of course, we didn't get away with it either".
"The economy dropped 40 percent, we had to cut production and there were also layoffs", explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must be able to take such unpopular measures from time to time.
But they managed to keep the company profitable, even if less than before the crisis.
But what they didn't do at Farmett was invest in R&D.
"We built a research and training centre with grants, strengthened presentations at international fairs, won major awards at domestic exhibitions", says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that the crisis is behind them.
Demand is rising again, and with it, the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere", says Karel Žďárský.
A survey that removes nonsense regulations
The Absurdity of the Year poll is the fourth installment of the business cycle.
Some nonsense regulations have already been repealed.
The unfamous winner of the next year of the Absurdity of the Year poll was the obligation to carry documents to the office that are also available to officials online.
More than a third of the less than 4,000 voters voted in favor.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper copy of the trade register, although an official could obtain it with two clicks of a mouse.
The survey will change that.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require the registration of the business register when checking the insurers", said Jana Buraňová, spokeswoman for the USSR.
To study all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with, and to cancel the nonsense, is the meaning of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This is the fourth edition of the business event organised by the Economic News this year and is gaining a growing public interest.
If last year there were about 3,000 voters, this year there were almost 4,000.
And no wonder, there are a lot of different legal obligations that are just for business retention, and we have a lot of them.
"We are perhaps the world's leading tax lease lease companies", says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
In recent years, ease of doing business has become a stated goal of all governments.
But the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving much compared to the rest of the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic has placed itself in 74th position in terms of business conditions, eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year was first announced in 2006 and is held annually under the same scenario.
Anyone can enter administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition closes.
The website www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. The organiser of the competition will then select seven candidates for the "anti-censorship" and let the public vote on it online during October at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
This year's survey included more than 100, or 105, statutes and regulations that are meaningless.
The tips were sent by businessmen, but also by trade unions and journalists.
For example, among the "finalists" of the competition, the nominees were required to pay a toll on motorways and expressways, or to paint every two years for entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets.
The list of this year's seven entries is published on the page of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November on Václav Square in Prague, is part of a hapenning that regularly attracts political and social figures.
For example, this year the competition was culminated with the participation of Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, President of the Czech Chamber of Commerce.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws businessmen underfoot, so my goal is to eliminate at least three dozen paragraphs each year that are unnecessarily complicating business today", said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
An attempt to overturn a meaningless order does not seem futile.
In 2007, the most difficult thing for people was the obligation of an entrepreneur to notify the grocery office of the place where the permanent establishment is located three days in advance of the intention to go to the exhibition or the trip with a stand.
This obligation was abolished by the new Life Insurance Act.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was to report a work trip of up to 30 days for its foreign employee, was abolished by the so-called Green Card Act.
And to the third of all good.
The absurdity of 2009 was the order for physical therapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor weights in their office.
This was eased this year by a Health Ministry announcement - the requirement to have a refrigerator is gone.
The new category recognises socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects shall be evaluated.
The new feature of the fifth annual Economic Newspaper Competition is the category of Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The aim of this competition is to promote sound and fair business.
"We want to support companies that take their business environmentally and promote socially responsible activities into account", says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of mobile operator Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as the Rebel of the Year competition.
This year's first edition of the 2010 Vodafone Firma Main Competition, a special sub-category, was open to companies for which business success is not the only long-term goal.
The stories of each of them are very inspiring and would have made a separate article.
Although the subject-matter of their activities differs diametrically from each other, support and consideration can be considered as the common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, for example, it concerns disabled people, and in another, it may concern personal problems or the health of their own employees.
For example, the Prague software company Et Netera was among the 14 finalists, which promotes the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then take part in a series of tournaments in different sports.
Another example of a responsible company in Pardubice is Isolit-Bravo, which has been a major contributor to the Foundation Fund for Disabled Children for 17 years.
The company, which owns more than 70 percent of its disabled employees, was awarded the title of Responsible company of the Central Czech Region and placed third in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced flexible working hours, further reduced to an average of 35 hours per week but without a proportionate reduction in pay.
The jury also awarded her the title for preferring to buy from Czech producers, supporting civic activities in the immediate vicinity and protecting the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment", explains activist Miluše Ryznarová.
Enlogit, an IT company in the Ústí region, takes care of its employees' health and provides ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports them to work from home and uses catering services provided by a local protected workshop at its corporate events.
"We also support the People in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Roma community", says Ondrej Suchý, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, it is worth mentioning the activities of Praní and the cleaning company from the Karlovy Vary, which contributes to the pension insurance of its employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We also contribute to food, transport, training and recreation", says Josef Strapáč of the Bruntal construction company Czasch, a winner in Moravian-Silesian Region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition who answered the questionnaire questions attached to the application were automatically submitted to the Responsible Company of the Year category and sent it to the organisers no later than 15 August.
The questionnaire replies that were incorrectly completed or incomplete were then excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Competition Responsible Company of the Year, but they are not disqualified from the 'main' contest of the Vodafone Company of the Year".
"Self-submission to this competition alone is not possible, as it is a sub-category of the main competition of the Company of the Year", explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzeň police arrested a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzeň, the anti-corruption police arrested her in recent days.
The detectives placed the rails on a local media businessman and real estate developer named Lubocha G.
The claimant allegedly tried to manipulate the public tendering procedure in progress to settle the restitution claims so that the land offered in the tender would be acquired by a specific beneficiary.
He was supposed to pay half a million crowns to Luboš G.
"I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for the offence of bribery in public procurement and competition", said Provo, the head of the Plzeň State Prosecutor's Office, Antonia Zelená, adding that no further details could be provided in view of the ongoing investigation.
Forty-six-year-old businessman was released after 24 hours by the police.
The way in which it could have influenced the public competition can only be speculated with the minimum of official information.
Lubomir Černá, spokesman for the Land Fund, said that police had actually arrested a detained workplace in Plzeň during a public competition.
"It was a client, not our employee", she explained.
The public tender is entitled 'Calling for tender for land transfer rights under the Land Act', according to the Black Administration, and is held if more than one eligible applicant has expressed an interest in the land offered.
'These persons are offering a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land under the call.'
'The order of the acquirers is determined on the basis of the claims offered and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims,' explained the Fund's spokesperson.
Luboš G. apparently had information on who had applied for the contest and, as he was also the person entitled to the contest, having purchased a number of restitution claims, offered the landlords that he would not participate.
He must have been collecting a severance package for that.
That would explain why he had such a large amount of money in custody.
Lubos G. had extra-standard contacts to the PF in Plzeň in the past.
He was a key figure in the case of former PF chief Vaclav Sankota, who was prosecuted for giving in return land on which a decision to place the building had already been issued.
It was at that time that Luboš G. obtained from the Fund, for example, land for the construction of public transport, in particular at the site where the entry highway into the Borská polska industrial zone was to be built.
Later, he exchanged them very favorably with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city itself, which was worth much more.
The city council had to step in, because otherwise it would have put the building in jeopardy by blocking the land.
Housing fees are hundreds a month.
From January, households will have to pay not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and steam, heat supplies and somewhere, rent increases.
Families will have to withdraw up to 100 crowns a month from their wallets from January.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, and in some cities you'll have to pay a tenth for water supplies, and in many places, central heating will be up to 10 percent more expensive.
The electricity supply in households should be 100 crore less per year than it is now.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission is not in a position to take any further action to prevent the use of the electricity from the renewable energy sector.
Gas is slowly retreating, but at the time when people are drowning the most and thus consuming the most.
So he also has to count hundreds of crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are being auctioned across the republic, central heating prices vary from place to place.
The price increases are mainly planned by the larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or the Castle of Kings will pay about 50 crowns a month for central heating from January, and more than 1,000 crowns a year for families in Liberia.
Prague's residents are also facing a 9 percent water and sewerage discount if the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent doesn't change, the roasted ones will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lowest in the whole of the Republic.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are already among the highest, the water and stowage prices are expected to rise by 7.4%.
For example, rental prices could rise sharply in 450,000 rental apartments where regulation ends in January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rent by up to 100 percent from January.
Those who won't agree to the new rental rate are going to sue the company.
The regulated rents that people pay in about 300,000 homes could rise by as much as 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk on fern and rum.
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally, a better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are the drinks most often consumed by alcoholics under the age of 15.
The exception is not the children who are being treated in hospital for monkeys repeatedly.
This is the experience of doctors who have experienced similar cases in the infant ward of hospitals.
"No beer or wine is completely out of style because it takes a long time to get drunk".
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol", said Ludek Pelikán, chief of the children's department at the Hořovica Hospital in central Czechia.
"If they can get a bottle of my dad's from the closet, it's probably whiskey, but fern and vodka are the dominant".
"The advantage of vodka is that it is poured into the juice and it doesn't make you feel so much", explained the principal.
And the spokesman for Motol Faculty Hospital, Eva Jurin, is also right.
"It's usually fernet or rum".
"It's modern alcohol today, especially in elementary schools".
"In some cases, it was the saliva they brought from home", Jurin said.
According to Mayor Pelican, drunken hospitalization of 13 or 14 year olds is a fairly common phenomenon.
Before the fires, where he's been working since this year, he worked for ten years at the pediatrics center in Motol where ambulances tie up the broken schoolchildren from around the area.
"There was a girl who lay with us about four times".
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was brought to us with 3.5 milliliters of extra blood alcohol combined with ecstasy", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at a show in the Holeshovice at some dance party".
"Interestingly, her mother didn't find it strange at all that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours", the mayor said.
Parental disinterest or even their considerable tolerance for drinking to their own offspring is often considered the main cause of the growing childhood drinking problem.
However, experts say that the word dependency is not a real issue for children.
"Alcoholics" means chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all its associated phenomena, and this is not the case in children".
"Those who drink repeatedly tend to have a distinctive unmanaged family-social background", explained Mayor Pelican.
According to Jurin's spokesman, about 40 drunk children were hospitalized at the children's clinic in Motol this year by mid-November.
But only those with severe poisoning who had to stay in the hospital get into the statistics.
Child alcoholics who are taken by their parents after an ambulance or taken home by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases where children just sit down after school and drink a bottle of soda, Pelican says there are three seasonal fluctuations to rely on: Witchcraft, New Year's Eve, and the end of the school year.
"They either drink the mourning of a bad testimony or celebrate the beginning of the holiday".
"But I've experienced seven child drunkards at once on a witch's table", said Pelican.
A drunk who spends the night detoxifying under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically at an advantage over a drunk who suffers from a nasty hangover at home the next day.
Early headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose trigger an irrigation infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"They're actually better off because they're having a good night's sleep and nothing hurts".
"They're just confused by where they are", admitted Pelican, adding that he sometimes makes patients feel better at least by calculating the cost of their treatment.
An ambulance and an emergency hospital bed can cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I used it as a means of education, then I calculated directly on the visit for the children how much their drinking cost and that they could also spend the whole summer in the brigade to make money for that one party", Pelican added.
However, it considers that health insurers do not take regressive measures to recover treatment costs from parents in the case of child alcoholics.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159s, out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has replaced with the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to Seville, Spain, on Tuesday, where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer is based.
It's the first time such a machine has ever been owned by anyone other than the Czech army.
So far, they've only been abroad for practice or show years.
It is a two-seater version of the L-159T1 that has been operated by the Czech Army and that has been airworthy.
The remaining three machines are single-seater L-159.
They're currently being held at the Waterfront Air and a commercial broker, Omnipol, took them over last week.
When the planes will physically take off from the Vodoest, according to Jan Pejsk of the Defense Press Office, is not yet known.
"The L-159 single-seat replacement aircraft were sequestered from long-term storage aircraft without further investment or investment from the Ministry of Rescue".
"The two-seat L-159T1s have been replaced in their current condition and shape", said the Footwork.
He added that the army would not be left without two-seat aircraft, since the Ministry signed a CZK 200 million contract with Aer Vodochodja in May 2009 to convert four unnecessary L-159s into two-seat machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other will be taken over by the end of this year.
According to the Foot, the EADS was committed to infiltrating the air force of some Allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that the L-159s are purchased by EADS and will be used for training pilots from NATO countries".
"It is therefore a matter for the customer how he will implement this", said Peșek.
The Economist newspapers have said before that the Spanish army, for example, has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa and the purchase of three more for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirka Topolanka.
The Ministry of Defence did not write a tender for the purchase and directly contacted EADS.
The defence leadership at the time argued that the exchange would support future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army has bought 72 machines from the Air and only uses 24, the rest they want to sell.
The purchase of the Casa planes will probably have a court order.
The European Commission has brought an action against the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice on the ground that the aircraft were to be selected on the basis of a pan-European tender rather than by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, the last one should arrive at Prague's Kbela airport within 14 days.
A longer indicator than a ring means a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a sign longer than a ring are at lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion from a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
It could be related to the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results suggest that the relative length of the finger may serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60", said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, especially in combination with genetic risk or other risk factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in the UK followed more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and over 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
More than half of the study participants had a pointer on their right hand shorter than a ring.
They were as likely to get prostate cancer as 19 percent of those with the same length of fingers.
But for those with a longer-than-ring index, the risk dropped 33 percent, even to 87 percent for men in their 60's.
The ratio of the lengths of the two fingers mentioned above - formed during the prenatal period - apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones that the baby is exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone matches a longer lead.
Previous research has shown that testosterone is the cause of growing prostate cancer.
A leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told the Czech Broadcasting Corporation that he was familiar with the study, but he did not think the link between finger length and cancer was "fully proven".
The Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
The roads and sidewalks are mostly covered in snow, and road users in many places have been driving all night.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between 89 and 93 kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and also stands D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
The Central Automobile Club (CAMC) dispatcher told the news.
A truck crashed at mile 91, two trucks collided at mile 93, and the crash resulted in injuries.
Several passenger cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at 185 km towards Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should either go down the 190 km road just behind Brno or drive over Brno and then drive to the 182 km road at Kývalce.
There are several miles of columns.
There's also an accident on the D11 highway, right on the way to Prague.
There are several centimeters of snow in Prague, with temperatures at minus seven degrees Celsius.
The columns of cars are made, for example, in Prosek, and the Styrboholska is also stuck.
The safest means of transportation is the subway.
Trams run late, for example, on the route between Charles's Town Hall and Peace Hall.
The Prague crisis team is due to meet again at 8:00 a.m.
Railways and airports also face problems.
The Czech railways have already had to cancel seven expressways due to the snow.
For example, the Prague to Kralup or Prague to Beroun route has problems.
Passengers should check the situation.
Ruzyna Airport was closed from 11pm on Wednesday to 5am.
Most roads in southern Moravia are already paved, but only with increased caution.
In Vishkovsk there are three byways that are impassable, in Brno, snow tongues form places, and in Blanensk, snow chains are necessary to overcome certain communications in the upper places of the snow chain.
Vishkovsk was one of the worst affected areas.
Rousynov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Saratice - Mileshovice are still closed.
They'll need to be pressed with a fridge to stretch them.
When they'll be launched, we can't predict yet.
In Hodonín, caution is needed in the White Carpathians.
The roads, which are only maintained by inert precipitation for nature conservation, contain up to five centimetres of snow, the CCC said.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, most often in the northern Czech Republic, sometimes as much as 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snow in the Czech Republic is gradually receding.
The American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known as the XM-25 code.
The generals hope the new automatic rifle will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is like a small, super-precise cannon.
Its projectiles are laser-guided to a few metres.
The special 25mm cartridges developed for this rifle, containing a highly explosive cartridge, actually work like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when hitting a target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can therefore be used against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle, behind a wall, or in a pit.
Shora is usually unprotected, and a deadly rain of steel shrapnel can knock him out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier basically treats it by finding the target, sending a laser beam to it, which determines the distance, thus obtaining a precise target point, adjusting the dimension and pressing the trigger".
"Let's say you measured 543 meters".
"When you press the trigger, the weapon loads and fires a rocket at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters", Audette said.
400 jobs to be relocated
Fujitsu is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their workplace from the current administration building at Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year.
Fujitsu Japan is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant in the computer and maintenance industry said Wednesday, 400 men and women will move their jobs from the current administration building in the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex on Lyons Street in the Frankfurt area called Niederrad, in July next year.
According to a spokesman for Fujista, 100 more of the Group's jobs, which are currently distributed in the region, are expected to be moved there in the near future.
The rental offer was very attractive and the large offices in Astro Park were said to be more in line with the work of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only for rent.
Competent businessman Bernd Wagner said, "We have found a headquarters in Frankfurt-Niederrad with excellent infrastructure".
Excellent airport connectivity is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The Frankfurt Economic Forum's chief economic adviser Markus Frank (CDU) said that this had helped to gain a "global player".
It's a "fantastic show of trust in this place".
Fujitsu is a city-friendly game, and settlement is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Green), regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed of his plan by the company's management in time.
"Of course we offered our help to the company", said Corvis.
But friendly contacts could not change the computer maker's difficulties with the Marienbader-class tenant.
The result was a decisive economic reason.
Now it's about avoiding long vacations in such a prominent location.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative".
The house on Rathaus Square, which was used by Fujitsu until now, and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were among the most discussed building projects in the spa town ten years ago, along with the other buildings on Marienbader Square.
The project was a joint project between the city and a private designer, the city entree, which was criticized for the massive construction of the areas that had previously served as parking lots and also for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, moved into the houses, as did the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was then still affiliated with Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired jointly by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and sold a year later to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu Group of Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides, for example, companies with computers and servers and provides the necessary service.
The headquarters in the Rhine and Mohan region is one of the largest in Germany, but the largest number of Fujitsu employees is in Munich.
Fujitsu Technology Solutions' subsidiary is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, with Fujitsu Services and TDS as additional subsidiaries at this location.
The administrative building Astro Park was rented for this purpose for 7,000 square metres.
The complex, which is named after the starry terrain, is 20 years old and is home to the central electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon is shutting down the server - threats against Assang
WikiLeaks is getting in a tight spot.
Amazon has turned off the discovery platform on its servers.
It's possible that this was done under political pressure after the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic messages.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
WikiLeaks, the disclosure platform, is under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their current home server in America and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's most wanted list, is supposed to be abstaining, according to a news report in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server".
"Free speech in the land of the free", activists announced via Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
The Internet company Amazon had recently downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to manage the high number of documents accessed in the release of secret diplomatic messages.
Using Twitter, WikiLeaks explained the move: "Okay - we're now spending our dollars hiring people in Europe".
If Amazon has such a problem with free speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon has stopped using its servers for WikiLeaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's associates reportedly searched, CNN reported, based on information from Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security has threatened a boycott of the Amazon, the Guardian reported.
"I wish Amazon had taken this step sooner, given the earlier release of classified information on WikiLeaks", the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, impolite and recklessly, and it puts our national security at risk and threatens life on the planet", said a statement from a neutral senator.
"No responsible company - American or foreign - should help WikiLeaks in their efforts to spread stolen material".
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's most wanted list.
According to a report in the London Independent, a 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, and Scotland Yard is said to know the exact location.
The Internet activist has always referred to the Swedish investigation as a plot by his opponents.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were threats.
"There were even calls for the murder of Julian Assange".
That's why Assange is rightly worried about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's why the founder of WikiLeaks will keep hiding.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In the United States, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has called for the person responsible for the WikiLeaks post to be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, a prime minister's adviser, Stephen Harper, told television - perhaps ironically - that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use a "target plane".
Meanwhile, a verbal gunfight between the White House and Assange has broken out.
U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange was asking Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to resign if she was responsible for the recently released spy calls to diplomats.
"I'm not entirely sure why we care about the opinion of one person with the website", Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and interests in this country are far more important than its website".
The U.S. government is now extensively investigating the security of its data banks.
The special commissioner has been appointed by the deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism Measures, Russell Travers, the White House said.
Travers has become responsible for developing the "necessary structural reforms" that are needed after the embassy reports are published on WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government has also announced that it wants to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should they become endangered by a WikiLeaks post.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them", said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary".
The University of Frost
At Gelato University in Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better season.
The three-day ice cream-making course is a big hit, and visitors come from all over the world.
Where do you get that ice cream anyway?
From Gelatiere and Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a Czech ice cream maker who's a little outdated, makes ice cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio takes a piece of ice cream out of a refrigerator, squeezes it in a shell and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to go to the Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream, they don't want to miss the Gelato-University of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, he established an ice cream maker's university to make ice cream from his machines match the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day Gelatieri course is a huge attraction and visitors come from all over the world.
But there are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and practices in your own ice cream shop.
Some people in their midlife crisis are eager for a new career, others dare to lean on the thin ice of their vague aspirations.
This time it's 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents -- from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and would like to offer a high-quality European product in the future in the country of industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and after years of stressful work, she wants to start her own business.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and a man from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman at Julia's house came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal properties of perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste, but also silk softness and consistency are decisive.
During his training at the Southern and Patriotic Cakes, Luciano remembers: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there's the notorious dose of romance".
The first step of production seems quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients of milk, skimmed milk, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns the towel on the machine and leaks the pasteurized white base cream, the base of all kinds of dairy ice cream.
The professor is immediately overwhelmed with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural ingredients without a stabilizer?
How can one experiment on one's own?
Luciano warns, let the spirit of the age take you into the unknown.
Those who say that ice cream is "of natural ingredients only" have apparently used stabilizers, mostly natural products such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, you can make ice cream without stabilizers, but it has to be sold within a day or it will collapse and the customer will eat the ice cream itself.
Certain variations of the basic substance are permitted.
It'll be more intense with the aromatic essence.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the flavor of the ice cream by the ingredients that are purchased in the supermarket, either in the fruit department or in the sweet department.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"The donors will try to force you to get a lot of flavored ingredients".
"But you should just experiment".
Be with fruit sorbetes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or a white basic ice cream that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa into the basis for all kinds of chocolate tastings.
Now she can take an ice cream machine course.
Luciano always has four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and ice cream - either with eggs or without them in the base material, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be done with fruit ice cream.
More flavorings, more fruit pineapple - not always better for taste.
Rice ice cream may not taste more like nuts when it contains more nuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the balanced mixture properly delivers the taste of gelato, Luciano says.
The production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: if peaches with a high sugar content are used, the sugar content of the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream needs an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano produces a device to measure the sugar content of the fruit (a winemaker uses it to measure the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
Making ice cream doesn't require as much physical effort as it used to.
It does not only aid the machine for the automatic production of the basic material.
There is also a device that simultaneously mixes the finished ice cream mixture into cream and cools it to a minus temperature.
With all the automation, we're not gonna avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo will stain himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit pies when a giant blender gets out of control.
"In every course", believes Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens".
Double-light auditors
The EFSA is linked to an industry that is experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a panel of experts at Testbiotech, which considers itself an independent biotechnology impact assessment institute.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've documented it well", said testbiotech head Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of Efsa's group of genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another expert at Efsa have been under contract to Ilsa's lobby group for several years.
It's funded by companies like Monsanto, Nestle, Bayer.
Kuiper was instrumental in the Efsa control regulations for genetic plants, and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticizes.
The EFSA rules are said to be in full compliance with the Ilsi documents and thus bear the handwriting of an industry which should be inspected by an authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has warned of a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from Ephesus moved to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without any additions or transition period - and changed sides.
Also, Central German Radio (MDR) recently revealed the EU-control agency's staff links with the industrial lobby, which has sparked interest from both the Environment Ministry and EU MEPs.
Meanwhile, Efsa can't recognize a conflict of interest.
All the relevant data, including those from the industry, are processed, if they are of high technical quality, is stated in one statement.
Professionals working for Efsa are not required to have no contact with industry.
But he has to prove it.
Kuiper admits to working for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the USA.
It is designated as a neutral forum for experts in science, industry and politics - among other things, for assessing the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticize the current use of genetically modified plants in animals without any attempt at feeding, and the lack of testing of the response of genetic plants to environmental influences.
"We want to know what, for example, a genetically modified corn will do in the field", says Then.
The current practice is to only test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which is not a reliable result.
"If risks are not sought, how can they be found?" asks Prosecutor Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees with that.
A researcher in the field of genetic engineering since 1994, she is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, industry, as in the United States, and now in Europe, is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That's why there are almost no scientists left who aren't connected to the corporations.
Studies that are critical to society are usually not published.
"The industry controls security research", Hilbeck believes.
The stone trail
Uli Gsell also got some, about 400 pounds in total.
On Monday night, he was standing outside Stuttgart station, tubing on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story goes, in September, the buoys came and began to tear apart a large part of the northern wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands demonstrated against the S21, a billion-dollar reduction in stations.
When construction stopped, most of the wings were in ruins.
Sliced into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheim limestone, a soft, rough stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's got a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics".
"He must not disappear".
It says, "A cheap and thin stone, simple and original".
When he cut one, he smelled like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the pieces yet.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
A stone footprint from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen, a former French army munitions depot where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
44-year-old man who sells old stones.
He bought all the ones that were made during the Stuttgart drilling.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed to the ground or disappeared to the landfill", says a wooden booth that was once a guardhouse in his office.
He says he was cursed and threatened when all the newspapers said in September that he bought the remains of the North Wing from a demolition company.
But he's been talking to S-21 opponents all day.
And he explained that he couldn't do the demolition.
And if that's happening, then it's the smartest thing to do is use the stones again.
Then it took about 200 S-21s, each about 80 kilograms in weight, for a piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memorial, some also hope to bring it back when it is rebuilt.
Rongen bought 500 tons of cargo from 25 large trucks.
About half of it's still in the woods, the rest sold out a long time ago.
Gardener, landscaper, builder of houses.
They came from all corners and pulled what went into the trunk and the trailer.
Stuttgart's stones of contention have long since been turned into "snakes" or the edges of herbal slopes.
"This stone is nothing special", says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political stuff".
He gets into his field car and goes for a ride through his 20-acre kingdom.
He studied law first, dropped out, then biology, then became interested in computers, and finally became a stone trader.
And a lover of stone.
He has 40,000 tons of stones in his pocket.
He's bringing his treasure from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest antique dealer in the republic.
It's slowing down.
There are artificially crafted sand dunes in the snow.
"They once belonged to the Marien-Bridge in Dresden", he says.
The sand-beetle from Labe, yellow, warm, excited.
"My favourite stone".
We're going up the road through the woods.
He points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe Station.
And then there's the next one.
"A little travertine".
These pictures once belonged to the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
There are stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt-travertine from the police headquarters in Stuttgart, red granite from the San Blasien temple, tuff from the hospital in Heilbron.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how they used to hand-break stones and transport them using simple stones and bull carts, he becomes quite reverent.
"It would be a scandal if something like this were crushed".
He didn't become rich, very rich at all.
Today, however, the stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition, there are stoneworkers, one sculptor, one quarryer, one glassmaker, and one gardener up in the woods.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying", says the one who evaluates the residual.
He's going to Cologne soon.
There's also a stone to be salvaged.
The Battle of the Talents for High Potentials
There's a lot of people at the refreshments.
16 students are pressing for loafers with salmon, tomato soup and candy.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and Volkswagen Motor Manufacturers have invited engineering and design students to the workshop.
They're here to talk about the car of the future with the developers of VW - and to get to know Volkswagen, by the way.
Many companies are trying to make it in the race for the smartest heads, just like VW, and they're betting on collaborating with universities.
Their mission is to recruit the most talented graduates into the auditioning industry as soon as possible, before they even get into the job market and get interested in others.
Since universities do not publish student achievement lists, companies are trying to find out and acquire exceptional talent in practice-oriented projects.
At TU Braunschweig, the car company is trying to get talent the next day.
A young lady in the personal department is handing out prints, rubber bears and VW logos.
He tells promising young talents about internship programs, student jobs, and shows them the way to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is running the project with VW.
He sees benefits for both parties: "Students will get in touch with the industry and gain experience".
"VW can get to know students at the same time, get to know interesting candidates, and think about who would be a good colleague".
Cooperation like this, according to Sella, is not uncommon.
But the news is, he's so openly fighting for his students.
"It was more of a substantial professional project", says Selle.
The fight for freshmen is probably gonna be even harder.
In many sectors, companies are no longer able to select their employees from a long pool of applicants.
It must, on the contrary, endeavour and endeavour to attract a particularly highly qualified workforce.
Above all, graduates of engineering have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers, 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to VDI's predictions, the so-called engineer shortage will continue to grow.
Roman Dicta is going after KPMG, an accounting and consulting firm, to hunt for talent.
It organizes challenging Recruiting events such as KPMG-Race, a type of modern treasure race where participants must find their way by GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the United States next year.
Participants can also browse KPMG's branches and get to know the company.
The participants shall be decided in advance in two rounds.
Only Crème de la Crème of many interested parties will fly to the United States.
In the battle for high potentials at universities, the dictates will be tougher laws.
"We want to distinguish ourselves with our race from others".
"A simple trip on a sailing ship was too little for us".
It seems the talent hunter of the Dict seems to be in luck.
"We've been in touch with all participants in similar events last year".
"Some will soon graduate and plan to apply for jobs with us", he says.
In addition to direct campus advocacy, SMEs are primarily classically presenting themselves in labour markets.
"We're trying to contact graduates at professional exhibitions".
'As in Intersolar,' says Sitha Stübe, head of personnel at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
There are currently 35 positions listed on the company's website.
"It's just difficult these days to fill vacancies".
"It's a lot of time and money", he says.
Another option is to contact the professors at the university.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiburg.
"Professors tell us that we can do internships or write theses".
The solar specialist doesn't run any expensive promotions.
Instead, the company tries to appeal to other advantages: a personal atmosphere, low hierarchy, and easy communication.
"Big companies often can't offer that", says Stübe's head of personal services.
Money has long been a key factor in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good procedure options are other decisive factors.
In one study, Solarworld ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute draws up an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, the staff are asked how satisfied they are with their work and working environment and the framework conditions of the staff are monitored.
The head of Stübe's personnel department hopes that the location will earn her points among job seekers.
"I think the interested parties are particularly informed about the external assessments of the potential employer", he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies looking to build a long-term strategy and reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr Krieger, it means, first and foremost, internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees", he says.
This is known professionally as internal employer branding, which is the promotion of the employer on the market within its own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors".
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will be able to advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances on their own.
"It's like a game of ropes", Kriegler says.
Obama stops the new oil wells
In the coming years, no new oil wells will be built off the coast of the US-Federal State of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Washington government has issued a corresponding ban - and thereby definitively cancelled earlier plans.
New wells off the Atlantic coast are also prohibited.
Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced this on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should be in place for at least the next five years, is the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon drilling tower in April.
Before this disaster, which claimed the lives of 11 workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled to the opposition and industry his willingness to allow new wells in the eastern Gulf.
The defendants are trying to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign oil supplies.
To this day, it is unclear who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf.
The UK energy giant BP is at the centre of criticism, facing billions of requests.
The commission of inquiry, appointed by Obama, should present the results by December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban he had been paying since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies submitted applications for new drilling plans.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster with stricter controls and strict security regulations.
The inspection authority is undergoing a major reform, which has brought many corruption allegations to its attention.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would eliminate lucrative tax evasion opportunities for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now openly warning that stricter regulation will drastically reduce the volume of oil extracted in the Gulf.
"Government plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the gas and oil industries", according to the results of a current survey by industry consultancy BDO - even before the drilling ban was imposed on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complained about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what the regulations will change".
Investments in new mining projects are being postponed until further notice - to the detriment of growth.
Ogoni area burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a pump: billions of litres of leaked oil have destroyed the nature of Nigeria's Ogoni region.
People live off the theft, corruption and illegal oil production.
Celestine Akpobari is thinking well.
"Don't worry", reassures the environmental activist: "You'll get enough oil mud in front of the lens today".
A 37-year-old Nigerian man watched an attempt to photograph a boy who was barking his breast in water surrounded by mud. The scene is almost beautiful in the water glow with rainbow colors.
The fact that brown oil spills float under the surface is invisible.
She used to collect enough shrimp in containers here, says Esther Badom, on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slow flowing water has become completely dead.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil spilled into a huge wet area from a broken pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to reach the fishery: Ogoni, in the heart of the Niger River Delta, is one of the worst-affected areas in the world.
The entire extent of the trigger is only noticeable on the way down the river through mangrove swamps with many side streams.
The engine on the boat cooks brown porridge instead of light water, and whoever dips his hand in the water pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves are like black pines, and the palms rarely let their leaves sadly hang.
We're looking for the birds that are common in wetlands: Once the engine on the boat is quiet, they get angry in the former paradise, where it smells like a pump, a creepy silence.
"What is happening here is an environmental warfare", says sadly Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant fear of health".
The comparison to war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement is a battleground where fighting has been going on for decades: over 60 years ago, the first European invaders arrived, the first resistance against the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa was formed in the 1980s, and Shell had to stop production in 1993 because it was too dangerous for its employees.
To date, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni area: while it benefits daily from an entire delta area three times the size of Switzerland with more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipeline over two million barrels of black gold, the Ogoni oil field is in a very volatile state for the company.
Every few hundred yards, steel structures are pulled out of the water like bizarre statues: "Christmas trees", so they are too tenderly called drill holes.
They're 50 years old, most of them dead-cut.
At any moment, this kind of drilling hole head breaks, Akpobari says, and then it drains a constant stream of oil into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion gallons of oil leaked into the delta's ecosystems in 50 years: Each year, as much as the Exxon Valdez supertanker disaster 21 years ago, one of the largest environmental disasters in human history, leaked into the sea off the coast of Alaska.
There is a dispute over who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell classifies sabotage and organized oil theft as more than 90 percent pollution, environmentalists cite crumbling well heads and unstable pipelines as the main cause.
Shell requires far fewer security regulations in Nigeria than is the norm in the world, said US scientist Richard Steiner in 2008: "The number of behavioural problems alone is said to be "many times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-filled workshop under the open sky, the figure emerges from the mangroves: completely naked and oil-filled.
Under one of the many vessels that are partly connected by a line, partly scattered around the earth, there is a fire: an illegal small refinery.
Oil in a pot of fire heats up for hours, explains Michael, the group's leader.
First, the gas leaks out of the pipe into the gas tank, then the kerosene drops at the end of the pipe, and finally the diesel.
This way, Michael and his four associates produce up to four 300-liter cans a day: "We'll make 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The people of the Delta are exploiting a chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria only owns one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents a litre of diesel can still be a little more expensive for illegal producers: they get the raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" that connect to the pipeline throughout the Ogoni region: experts say that at least 16 million litres of oil are lost daily throughout the Niger Delta.
But only a negligible fraction of the raw materials temporarily stored are illegally harvested: the largest share is filled by organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military officials, into tankers and sold on the world market.
The debate over whether the disaster was caused by the inhabitants and their interventions or the lax production method is considered by activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies had not been considered invaders and had not destroyed the livelihoods of fishermen, there would have been no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries".
In the meantime, Ogoni's relationship with Shell is so damaged that only the Group's departure is considered: "Other nations like the Chinese may prove to be better".
Michael is restless.
"It's time to go", says the muscle maker.
"Soldiers could be here any minute".
If a special forces unit found them, they're not in prison, they're in painful bribery.
Also, soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw materials.
"This damned thing has taken our land to its bottom in every way", says Akpobari.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous construction error in the A380 engines.
The A380 has a major security flaw.
Investigators examined the emergency landing machine and found a possible construction error that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas Airlines wants to sue the engine manufacturers.
Qantas airbus passengers were apparently more fortunate in an emergency landing in early November than previously known: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety flaw in the engines of some A380s in its investigations - and now warns of a possible construction error.
The failure could have serious consequences: cracks could occur in one oil link due to wear, the ATSB said in a statement released on Thursday.
This fact could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce for 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It has submitted a reasoning to the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows for further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company will seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts were released and the carrier surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce has identified burning oil as the cause of the damage.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests on giant aircraft equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The safety deficiency was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas emergency landing, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily grounded three of its 11 A380.
Lufthansa has replaced one A380 engine as a safety precaution.
The double-decker is the largest private plane in the world.
A nationwide snowfall will cause traffic chaos
Germany in white: almost all over the country it snowed overnight.
Many roads are in chaos, and train and plane connections are disrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is freezing in Germany: Almost the entire republic collapsed in snow on Thursday night, causing traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, up to 15 centimeters of snow fall in some places.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, road service was still on duty, but the newly formed snow was not being controlled.
There was also a strong gust of wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is expecting a storm surge of 1.2 metres above normal in the morning off the coast of the Baltic Sea in Schleswig-Holstein.
Snow races have caused considerable problems on motorways and state roads in Saxony.
According to Meteomedia, the worst weather in Saskatchewan was a purple alarm, the highest ever.
From there, 30 centimeters of new snow came, strong, fresh winds causing the turns.
Several trucks and passengers were left overnight.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have reported major road problems.
A2 was hit by wind and snow, slow traffic and congestion.
There were snow issues in Durynsk on the A4 and A9.
According to the German route, there are major problems in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Düren and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the rails, overturned trees on the rails or broken upper wires and bends.
The long distance service from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped in Saxony.
In the Düren Saalfeld had to stop an ICE to Munich.
165 passengers on board received wool blankets, food and drink from firefighters and rescue workers.
Snow winds blowing over the road.
Many flights at major German airports were cancelled due to snowstorms.
According to the spokesman of the Flight Information Centre, cancelled flights from Munich have already been reported.
In Frankfurt nach Mohan, it was cancelled, according to Fraport's spokesman, for 40 years.
Road maintenance is in constant service.
Although few passengers remained unconnected at the airport, 400 field beds are available.
There were many accidents on many roads as early as Wednesday night.
Tonight, a truck driver was killed in a train crash at a railway junction in eastern Holstein.
The engineer was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to the snow-covered road: a truck was also caught on a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train, so the Bayreuth to Nuremberg route remained closed until the early hours of the morning.
And then a 30-year-old woman died after her car collapsed on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
But the good news for meteorologists is that the snow will remain in the form of light dust, and therefore it will rise even with light winds.
But the wind will weaken.
Only in the Baltic Sea will there be strong winds of hurricane strength.
But it's going to be very cold - up to minus 15 degrees locally.
Deutsche Bank is looking to buy twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to a news report, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in Frankfurt.
The property could be worth up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its Group headquarters: the twin towers in the Frankfurt bank district have been modernised; in the meantime bankers have been allowed back to their old jobs.
Now, however, the financial group seems to want the renovation costs back - and is looking for buyers for both skyscrapers, as reported by the Financial Times Deutschland, citing a spokesman.
The speaker did not give the reasons for the planned sale.
"We're still looking at whether it makes more sense to own or sell property and then rent it back", he said.
This means that the largest credit institution in Germany is once again giving up its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The Bank only acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from its own fund investors and subsequently underwent a costly renovation.
The energy conversion is estimated to have swallowed up around 200 million euros.
I think the sale would bring the bank a lot of money.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers renamed Greentowers at around 500 million euros.
The spokesman said it was not decided whether the building would be sold back to the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn the dead miners
More than 10,000 people have paid tribute to the sleeping miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after a series of mine explosions.
The dead have yet to be rescued because the security situation in the shaft remains complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a major explosion at the Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 were trapped in the mine.
A probe was launched into the shaft where the accident happened, but it found no trace of life.
Due to the high concentrations of toxic gases and the subsequent explosions, the rescue forces could not be withdrawn for safety reasons.
The second major detonation was the authorities and experts assuming that the miners had no chance of survival.
Still, they haven't been able to get the dead.
Now they've honored the memory of the dead's relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, New Zealand's South Island, 10,000 people gathered for sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
To honor the slaughtered miners, 29 tables were erected, with helmets, candles, and names of the miners.
Also, pictures and personal items like clothing and surfboards have found their place here.
The flags were half-ribbed on the state government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that miners would once again come out of the "depth of the earth", New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the commemorative event.
"But they never came home".
He can't say goodbye to his son until he sees his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was thrown into the mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats also attended the memorial.
British and South African miners were also hit during the explosion on November 19.
Rescue workers started by setting fire to a coal mine in New Zealand's South Island.
Once the poisonous gases dissolve, the high temperatures inside the mine will begin to cool, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you warriors!
Is horror a good thing for art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to push back the boundaries with his fight epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and in a big way kills almost with supernatural force his opponents - sounds ideal for young male spectators who are looking for bloody action, as our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and his enemies even roar his guts out of his belly alive when he's in a bad mood.
On the other hand, the One-Eyed, as he is actually called, won't say a word throughout the film, and the other characters will either say at most one or two sentences or be dragged into the painful death screams.
Otherwise, he's silent and playing in the terribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult movie enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera shots.
It's good that the film has multiple target groups, but it's a shame that they're excluding each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized drug-dealer trilogy "Pusher", is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to bring his works closer to the mainstream with either more humor or less brutality to the artistic audience.
Most art-cinema fans seem to be discouraged by the brain and guts that are everywhere.
Action movie fans get bored at the latest when the One-Eyed One goes off for reasons beyond their control with a group of violent Christian missionaries on ships to Jerusalem and hangs around forever in the wind and mist until the crew apparently arrives in America and remains silent.
No wonder Walhalla Rising was not released in theaters in Germany and is now available only on DVD.
It's a shame, not only because of the beautiful footage, but also because behind the distinctive façade, the places where the blood is stained, there's an exciting cinema that deserves a little attention.
This film is not about dialogue or the exact story, it's all about the atmosphere, a fiery dream that became a movie.
And that's not a run for the viewer.
Refn won't give him a moment of relief and slowly chokes him with his chilling footage and clouded hypnotic soundtrack, especially the indescribable hatred that comes from the characters' hearts.
Only a little blond boy who helps One-Eyed keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by evil.
Of all the one-eyed heroes whose motives are never explained, who becomes a time for enemies and transient allies a warrior from hell, perhaps an emissary of the devil.
It's a representation of destruction, perhaps, but also only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
It was an experience.
Mysterious earthwork
The IAEA has a new alert for a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is defending itself - and not allowing control.
At around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15s will attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It is on the Euphrates; the nearest major city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents indicate that it is a reactor that Syria allegedly built with North Korea's help in this square hidden in a valley that diverts from the current.
According to a CIA report from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited to producing plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be made.
The 1950s technology is the only thing that's good for it.
The CIA was presenting video with unfocused satellite imagery.
Using computer animation, she clarified where the components of the reactor could have been before the destruction, which is supposed to be a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, photographs were presented showing the building nearby or even from the inside.
The reactor was reportedly shortly before launch, but without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, not much more is known than then, even the riddles have grown larger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was very certain before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in al-Kibar, but had essentially no evidence that the country had an "active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence agencies in Europe are even more cautious, only talking about the "alleged reactor", even though they consider the CIA's presentation "credible".
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how certain he was that he had a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat said that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
The supposed "unused military buildings" were quickly cleared and the Syrians also smoothed the terrain.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of man-made uranium at el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received via a Member State satellite images of commercial dealers from the immediate aftermath of the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these footage are not on the market because they were bought exclusively by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
The IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it never had a secret nuclear program and never built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus has said.
But that was rejected by the IAEA after particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as has satellite imagery.
In addition, he forbade the auditors from a second inspection of al-Kibar and access to the ruins of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this", confirmed the official statement recently by then-Government Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case has been going on in vain since June 2008 and "is becoming a serious problem in terms of the credibility of the Authority", as admitted by a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - a serious breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA is overseeing.
The IAEA considers the key to progress on the issue of three other facilities that are supposed to be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor - and, unlike it, are still in existence.
The auditors have not yet disclosed which devices are involved, what their function is or why they are suspect.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally designates them as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C. (ISIS) has identified these objects and found a building complex on satellite imagery that is likely one of the suspected objects.
It's probably inside or near a military base - which is exactly why Syria is refusing IAEA access to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was reported that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition -- that the IAEA would be sent in advance by the US to scout the military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the facility by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has evidence and satellite imagery that material was transported back and forth between these three sites and the Euphrates Square.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one should be "related to fuel production".
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. enrichment of uranium and reprocessing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from and where it would later be used to make plutonium for a bomb, there are only probable estimates of these central questions.
It is also unknown whether the debris that could have hidden important traces is stored in these three locations.
Like hundreds of truckloads disappeared from the surface of the earth, no one seems to know where that shit got to.
The IAEA considers unlikely that the al-Tibni salt mine, which was inspected by Syria in 1998 as a suitable storage facility for radioactive waste, is located just a few kilometres from al-Kibar and across the Euphrates.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked him to the reactor in one of his satellite imagery analyses for the renowned journal Jane's Intelligence Review.
But space images show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out ground work at all suspicious sites and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clear the suspicions.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent many months developing a plan for auditors to allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only this effort shows how much interest the auditors have.
Meanwhile, Damascus has rejected this proposal.
If a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna reassured us that the reactor was destroyed and that the thing was not burning, for several months now, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about so-called special inspections, one of the toughest means the Vienna Nuclear Office has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose inspections, has already spoken about "possibilities I'm looking forward to in the future", but he's hesitant.
This choice carries a great risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA's governing council, and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they end up finding nothing?"
Love in time of war
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on her as-yet-unnamed directorial debut this summer, there have been problems.
She wrote the script herself, it's a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
Much more is not known yet - but it is also causing unrest.
There's a lot of talk about this Muslim woman falling in love with a Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, so the planned filming was quickly moved from Sarajevo to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and is in post-production, but there is still a protest in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women War Victims wrote to Jolie via the UN refugee agency UNHCR and asked to meet with the actress, now reports Bosnian newspapers - Jolie is also the UN refugee agency's ambassador.
It's not exactly diplomatic - she offered to meet the women in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In rape camps, love stories never happened, and Jolie's attitude toward the victims reveals a lot about the script.
Her organization has therefore recommended that the UN Refugee Agency release Jolie as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What scenes did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which had read her script, allowed the filming after a smaller shoot in Sarajevo - it's not entirely clear why Jolie didn't come.
The young author emphasizes that her film has no political intentions, that she has devoted herself to the conflict in Yugoslavia with great effort, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all parties involved.
It remains uncertain due to its contents.
There's another version of the film that's going on the Internet that sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the war started and they meet again when she's like a Bosnian Muslim girl being dragged into a Serb camp where he serves as a guard.
Which is actually quite different than "a rape victim falls in love with his tormentor".
The fact that Jolie really starts before the war is true.
Jolie insists that pressure is being exerted on her, which is "unfair and based on false information".
Now she can be freed by Hollywood hackers by illegally posting her script online, as they have done many times.
Nothing but gone
Tonight is good for the Irish again.
Not a trace of grief.
The home team dominates the host nation in Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans are shouting for joy at the sound of loud music, their asses on their feet.
Bailey-Pub in Cork, southern Ireland, is hot because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three metres into beer cups - and they hit.
"Birthing Pong" is called the bizarre theater and you can win 500 euros as a prize winner and a ticket to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this screaming beer game and this restrained computer guy, they don't quite fit together.
Yet, the 26-year-old man is trying to have fun, to relax from the weighty question that the future will bring.
His plan is not a passionate game in Las Vegas, he's going to New Zealand for an interview in January.
"I have such a strange feeling about it", he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job yet".
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she got her dream job as an Event Manager right away, maybe it's a good sign", says the young man, smiling.
Due to the poor outlook at home, two of the three Tanner brothers have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
Boys leave: Like the Tanners, it's like many families on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, predict experts at the ESRI Institute for Economic and Social Affairs in Dublin.
They even count 200,000 immigrants by 2015.
For such a small country of just 4.5 million people, it's a huge loss.
If the predictions are true, there will be a wave of migration like the one that took place in Ireland in the 1980s.
After decades of prosperity, discomfort is spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly affecting young, educated Irishmen who have only experienced a boom so far.
The loss of jobs and social degradation seemed absurd in these boom years.
Everyone needed it, money was too much.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times has many letters from readers complaining: "Everything is going wrong in Ireland".
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, he goes away and our country loses a generation".
"Let the last one please turn off".
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students' Union, sees the future in black because the government is only lying and offers no prospects for the future to young people.
"They're cutting the minimum wage, but they don't have a strategy to create new jobs", says the 20-year-old.
She watches her classmates go from one unpaid internship to another.
Her biggest concern is that she'll have to move out on her own in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing".
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to look at the issue in a positive way.
McLarnon is organising the WorkingAbroadExpo, an exhibition offering a comprehensive service on the subject of working abroad.
"For beginners in the job market, working abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps to a career", says the manager.
His website features photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley, but freedom and joy.
Sean O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something elsewhere for six months.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues in a construction project in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he's moving to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
O'Donovan, meanwhile, rarely gets home because he works overtime to pay off his home loan.
"Sometimes things are a little crazy", he says, crossing the threshold of his own home for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I'm not at all in".
He laughs desperately and walks through the cold rooms.
A small house is in a good neighborhood with well-maintained gardens, and large, expensive cars are parked in the driveways.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100% borrowed.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions", he says.
Is he worried that the loan might not work out?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, drinks hot tea, and says, "I don't have children to feed, and I'm young; even if things go wrong, I can start again".
A civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he hears so often now.
"No one needs to go hungry - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island", he says.
"A few minutes abroad is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we'll just feel like Irish".
He laughs and then tells us about his father, who left for England during the last financial crisis.
"After seven years, he was back and life in Ireland was flowing on, quite simply".
Cian Tanner likes the idea.
Keeping an open future and just waiting for life to unfold elsewhere.
He's also had a few years of work in London, and why shouldn't New Zealand be good for him and his girlfriend?
But there's one other thing that's been troubling him a lot these days: his 27th birthday celebration on Friday in Dublin.
She's afraid she might twist to the farewell party.
"Mostly no emotion", he says, and drinks a good beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing.
"Let's call it a party, just like that, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games".
Common practice of democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private enterprise.
Punitive activity is more worrying than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the latest Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it is possible to monitor changes in attitudes across the region.
In this year's survey, which was conducted in September and early October, two related issues dominate.
The first is that Latin America is in a fairly cheerful mood.
The second is to increase stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several Pacific Rim countries in South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy was recovering from a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous regions, are Democrats, which is down from the regional average (see Chart 2).
Around 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same as last year, but a large increase from 2001 when it was 25%. (Figure 3)
Some 34% said they trusted the House and 45% trusted the government, again the same as last year, but a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy in Latin America was undermined by the economic crisis.
The support was likely created during the global financial crisis because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009, and fell again this year to 32 percent.)
However, mood varies widely from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in the widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where recessions have been more severe and violent crime has worsened.
For only the second time since the surveys began, more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important problem rather than unemployment (see Chart 5).
About 31% say they or their close relatives were either victims of crime last year, but this is down from 38% last year and also the lowest number since 1995.
The stronger economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents across the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that allows their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela agree (and 80% there support private enterprise), although their left-wing president Hugo Chávez owns many private companies.
Brazil is the leading country in the field, as noted by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential respondent country in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Critical choices
No one expected the general election in Haiti on November 28 to be perfect.
But they were far worse than outsiders trying to help a country with disabilities to fear.
The election was filled with polls and repeat voting, ballots scattered across the channels, polling stations broken and intimidation.
The polling stations are open after hours of late.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around trying to find out where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed presidential candidates, have shouted that this is fraud and called for the election to be canceled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
Yet, Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said that "in many ways it was a pretty good choice".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean cautioned that they "do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, need not necessarily have called off the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are tied to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All the hopes of the election are not lost.
Two of the leading opposition candidates, Michel Martella, a rapper and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn from their original call to annul the vote.
But the problem could arise if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no voter support, is designated by the Electoral Commission as having achieved a decisive victory.
The ongoing cholera epidemic and the more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake have raised fears that voter turnout will be low.
Eventually, many Haitians wanted to vote, but disorganization prevented them from doing so.
About 250,000 identification cards required for voting remained unissued shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And so it's clear that the Haitians are going to do it themselves.
# After the peaks to the centre #
In the weeks of her sudden widowhood, Argentine President Cristina Fernández has been enjoying public sympathy, with her popularity increasing from 20 percent to more than 50 percent, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this success into a successful campaign for a second term in office next year may depend on the grieving Mrs. Fernández renouncing the uncompromising commitment of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And that's what all these signs are going to be based on.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to pursue economic policy after his wife successfully became president, was accustomed to budgeting that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend their additional income at will.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized by the death of Mr Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement have joined Mrs. Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which the government was framed and accused of corruption), Congress was unable to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not arguing", the president said.
The 2010 budget will now be spent on next year, with the president having more room to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: growth is likely to reach 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private and trade union estimates say it's approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was in an economic slump, prioritized poverty growth and reduction over inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector and cleared INDEC, the statistical agency that has taken over the official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernandez now temper this policy?
It called for negotiations between private enterprises and trade union leaders.
And her officials say they want to cut wages to 18 percent next year.
The economy was supported by the increase in world prices for Argentine agricultural exports.
But inflation disrupted growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
That may be why Mrs. Fernández is making known that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government entered into an agreement with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
Now, Mrs. Fernández is facing deals with creditors in the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that the IMF should not be aware of this fact, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to propose a new national consumer price index that would commemorate the introduction of the INDEC cleanup.
It is not yet clear whether Mrs. Fernández will want to remain in politics after her term ends when her husband is no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs the support of the middle class who's tired of kirchnerism.
By the time the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the tide of sympathy will be falling.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether to quietly renounce many of her husband's political views.
Half-incentive for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of their big brother overseas?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible voters, voted on November 27 for mayor and city council in five city districts, which can be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that prevail on the mainland and have a strong hold on business relations, including the partially free trade agreement, in the largest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the exam, but only narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party won three of the five mayoral offices, it failed to win a majority of the vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, which is inclined to greater Taiwanese independence, won almost 50% of the vote against 45% of the KMT.
If this is a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's share of the vote has dropped by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP was in the city council together with the KMT.
The election was held like most Taiwanese elections, which included loud election trucks and mass rallies with flags and a bunch of girls in dresses.
It was even part of an obligatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was campaigning for the KMT candidates on election night.
A man from the crowd shot young Mr. Lien in the face, wounded him and killed a spectator.
Oddly, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the head of the DPP, claims the shooting affected the election, the suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
I hope the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the mainland itself remained in the background.
Instead, candidates floated about plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threat from China.
The KMT thus tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refused to incite anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a reaction to the fact and a recognition that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
President Ma, for his part, confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The Beijing government can be expected to continue to engage in commercial bribery, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
They'd like to see political integration, too, but in order.
It's better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has discovered itself, anyway.
Two years ago, she was on the wrong footing: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a loudmouth and a clear advocate of independence.
But under Mrs. Tsai's leadership, a new generation has developed, which is moderate and DPP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been touted as the DPP's presidential candidate, as Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr. Chen, for example.
Their party is now doing everything it can to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for the research institutes that serve as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party is a "trusted alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be upset by this move.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that the DPP candidates would be better off if they insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will be fighting to choose between potential candidates.
KMT is authorized to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's reviews were poor, despite the overwhelming pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
Its dislike seems to be based primarily on unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
KMT spokesman says he's reorganizing his cabinet, as are local branches.
The strongly pushed proposals to support Taiwan in establishing friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonia Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point of no return is over".
Grammy nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the Best New Artist category
Acting at the President's request and the people must be legally noticed.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer who was chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is being named as one of the surprise Grammy Awards this year with a nomination in the Best New Artist category.
Since Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008's "Esperanza", the nominations came a little late, but it is in line with Grammy rules, where an artist cannot release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established".
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly took a step forward, and with her carefree vocal style and a flickering hand with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can speak of the Spaldings as a success recorded in 2003 by Norah Jones, the closest equivalent to Grammy voters seeking similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy judges rightly praise the Vijay Iyer Trio's album "Historicity" in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing ride on the album that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album by the experienced saxophonist James Moody, "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley, "Positootly".
Trombone Shorty, a charismatic New Orleans fan favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which is otherwise inclined to albums by Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin, and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, a savage group with steampunk knowledge, earned several well-deserved accolades in the big band category, with the competition being the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and the still-brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" provided a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a band member.
Grammy Award nominees: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical music category
The classical music nominees at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards have a wide selection of musicians and composers from around the world.
The lead in the nomination is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five points, and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the Southern California nominees was Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work commissioned through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance to win an award.
The classical music nominees are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The classical music producer of the year category has five nominees, including Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The classical album was nominated for Bruckner and his Symphonies No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As for the opera category, the nominations are Berg and Lulu from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and Marc Antonio e Cleopatra from Ars Lyric Houston; Kaija Saaria and L'Amour de Loin from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and The Enchanted Wanderer from the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and Ivanhoe from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers nominated for Grammys for contemporary music include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a performance recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic under the score of Esa-Pekka Salon.
The 30-minute piece is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and the Mandolin Concerto was nominated for instrumental performance by a soloist with orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote a 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin performer Avi Avitala, who performed in concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I sang it with the help of Middle Eastern tones and many North African rhythms", Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral performance for conducting the Chicago Symphony on the recording of Stravinsky's work.
Among the instrumental soloists nominated are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the violinist Paul Jacobs; the violinist Julia Fischer; and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were nominated for the singles this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of the classical transition, soprano Jessie Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Planned mosque in Temecule receives approval from the Planning Commission
The planned mosque in Temecule received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public witnessing.
Critics have attacked the project for promoting terrorism and for leading to a trade suspension.
However, the jury decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center would be in compliance with local laws and be aesthetically pleasing.
"Many good people came to support this project - Christians, Jews, for all you remember", Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"I am very proud of that as an American citizen".
"It means justice always wins".
"The odds are minimal", he added.
"Those who oppose, only shout out loud".
"We have really great people in our valley".
The talks began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight, when most of the time they took discussions with people who were for or against the center.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore", one comment appeared.
"We are the planet of monkeys with the Statue of Liberty embedded in the sand".
"America is down".
The Islamic Center has also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of about 135 families had been in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted a larger and more suitable space than the warehouse he had hired with a filter manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot Mediterranean-style mosque will also have two minarets and rise to a height of 43 feet.
It's supposed to occupy a 4.32 acre site on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes increase the possibility of new life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients is expanding the space for searching for new life on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth, and they say it's a sign that life has possibilities that stand outside the main elements that have been previously considered essential.
"This organism has a dual capacity".
"It can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic".
"This fact is very strange, but it is not evidence that it is some form of really 'extraterrestrial' life", commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
For a long time, six basic elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur - were considered essential to life.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after phosphorus replaces arsenic.
"You'll start to wonder what else is possible", said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is important for the search for life beyond Earth, because researchers need to be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report on this news release to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the find, sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report revealed the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
"It shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life", explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, U.K.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the substitution of one element for another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure", Cockell added.
It wasn't a random find.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it showed high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she thought that a microbe exposed to both elements might be able to replace one another.
"Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus".
"As a result, organisms find it very difficult to separate these elements".
"However, arsenic is so different that, like phosphorus, it doesn't work, and when it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes", Anbar explained.
Scientists are gathering bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposing them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which is the bacteria's ability to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better when phosphorus is present, but because they can also survive by replacing arsenic, there is an increased possibility that a form of life using arsenic could naturally occur elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, a microbiology assistant at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic being replaced with phosphorus is not new, but there has never been an example to prove this fact.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, so scientists speculated that it could be used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways of creating life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth", said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy, and the National Institutes of Health.
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton.
Two of the four exhibit dogs that were stolen from the Bellflower Motel were found, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff reported it on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two Akits and a Welsh pembroke corgis - went missing on Tuesday when someone stole a 2006 Chevrolet Express van where they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel, officials said.
Two dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon and two dogs will be left behind Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine", Whitmore said.
"They are in good condition".
"They were transferred to their rightful owners".
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he give any details about their whereabouts.
"The investigation is ongoing".
"We don't want to talk about it", Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules".
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not contacted to comment on the case.
They were thrilled when their two assets were found at a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and two dogs separated in Compton.
Akita Trace, three-year-old Trace dog and 10-month-old bitch Didi were unhurt, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who were scheduled to compete in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, were not found until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to compete in the AKC/Eucanuba National Championship in Long Beach, where they plan to show off Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days before the AKC/Eucanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on a couple's nearly month-long dog show trip.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered at the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car outside the window of their room.
They also took three dogs - a boxer dog, a Parson Russell terrier, and a British hot dog - who stayed in a motel room with them.
Akita and Pembroke left Welsh corgis in the car where it was supposed to be colder.
They opened the windows a little bit so the dogs could get enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car theft at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who leads them to the missing dogs.
It was unclear on Thursday whether prizes would be awarded.
The lion is ready to scream again now that the MGM restructuring gets final approval from the court.
After 18 months of shock and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Thursday officially blessed the creditors' "pre-packaged" plan to settle about $5 billion in debt, clearing the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company focused on producing and producing movies and TV shows.
On Thursday's report that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, MGM is no longer in any legal hurdle to restart Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the principal directors of the disassembled studio.
The number of employees will drop to about 320 from the original 400.
MGM will not suddenly exit Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has agreed on a planned financing facility to lend $500 million to finance new operations and production of MGM.
Now it's a connection to an investment bank that needs $75 million of its own and is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to resolve its finances as management struggled to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
That August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former CEO of Enron and a turnkey expert known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve the financial problems of MGM and 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to sell the company by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several interested parties, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus the financing demanded by the creditors.
By the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan, and after months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditors in late October.
When MGM officially pulls out of the audition in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collect $375,000 a month for their services that run the company, will receive a success fee of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which has only released one film this year, and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films featuring the book "The Hobbit", together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to negotiate a special loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its stake in these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, was looking for the possibility of merging the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys that will keep your gift budget balanced
The top contender this year is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by the video game system, but in both cases, it's a significant impact on the gift budget.
Let's say you can buy five BMX wheels for $99 for one iPad, and one Kinect game is worth 10 coral reels, or about 48 cups of Play-Doh.
But there's a way to balance your gift budget.
I recently visited three national toy retailers -- Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club -- and looked at what electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law was working; this year's technology toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, than in previous years.
While relatively few new toys with affiliated websites have appeared, the two most popular toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as are those with charging batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices mentioned are from Toys 'R' Us, except where otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, from age 3) are plush animals that sing when you squeeze their belly.
With one press, the animal makes a tone, and the second press starts to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start pressing, you can't stop.
The best choice for singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey.
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animated doll from Elmo Live Technology that can play the Simon Says game and also walk the moon with its innovative wheel-blocking folding leg.
The children are testing the dance instructor Mickey's toy, although their parents complain about a lack of noise control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you might remember Alfie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3-year-olds), with a backpack full of quizzes that are designed to turn driving into fun with a self-paced, funny workbook.
If you're sending a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60 for children ages 3 to 8) is the cheapest, easy-to-use, keyboard-based variant, although the games do not have as effective instruction as Leapster Explorer ($70 for children ages 3 to 12), the first major change in the Leapster lineup from Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with the older units.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90 for children ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-like system to introduce games and ebooks and has an SD card slot that allows family photos to be displayed.
And finally, the Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for kids 8 and up) is a set of five dice that are no bigger than a box of lights, each of which has a LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing the dice in a row before time runs out; it's great for competing in improvised word creation.
More and more toys have at least some sort of online connection.
At its peak, the toy stores were home to two toys, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
If you want to buy a toy online from Club Penguin for your child, you can choose, for example, the Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for children ages 6 to 12), which contains a hidden code coin.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credit from the Club Penguin store for any two items.
That could include a roller skating rink or a Puffle animal.
A little bit larger than the size of your toothbrush towel is the Hexbug Nano, $10 for kids ages 5 and up, the latest in a series of button-battery microbots.
The beetle moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It's fun to make a maze out of dice and see if he can find his way out.
It's also very durable.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in the back of our dog's lawn.
The introduction of more subtle police controls in China
As the city's military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked the square, strictly controlling his orders and issuing orders aloud with military authority.
He wanted the female members - the Chinese high-ranking enforcers of urban order, feared and despised for their harsh actions and their love of violence - to make a certain impression on the noise of the passersby.
"Put yourself up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispering quietly, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants stood in the spotlight.
Four pairs of black shoes are arranged according to the rules.
The four head covers fit perfectly into the hair, which is perfectly bound by blue and white stripes.
"I personally think they look average", said Mr. Tang in a glance.
"Models are nice".
More than one government has tried to revive the image of city clerks in China.
One city ordered that the new defenders have a college education.
Guangdong Province has changed the gray-green uniforms to a more attractive blue.
In central China, Wuhan replaced the hard-line view with a powerful weapon: In 2009, a report reported that 50 officers were relentlessly surrounding a snack cart and staring at the owner until the home salesman packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen surgery as its main image.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its city police force, selected specifically for their appearance, submissiveness and young age.
The aim is to show the police's more subtle, feminine side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese city groups.
Critics would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city ordinances, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media typically capture a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Police officers shot an uninvolved spectator to death after he used his cell phone to record a protest at a landfill.
Last year, a police training was held in Beijing, and a manual for the training was stolen and posted online, including a description of how to beat off criminals without blood marks.
This year, a shrewd melon dealer in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered a left brain injury.
A violent video game that can be downloaded online shows Chinese police officers attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan has intimidated the government", China Daily, the national newspaper, lamented last year after further discussion of the tactics.
The paper said "a thorough cleaning".
Skeptics say that's not enough.
After the district announced in October that there would be eight new female police officers, the editor of The Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real duties or are just distractions.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district required female applicants aged 18 to 22 years old with good looks and "five facial features in the right proportion".
Adepts should be taller than average, or over six feet [1.6 m].
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials say work is too psychologically demanding for women over 25.
"Their image is an important thing", said an unnamed police officer on Rednet.com, as if on a government website.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which are then determined by others, including height, weight, facial features, etc".
Then comes the line of nature and "inside qualities".
Women are like vase flowers, he said, adding, "In addition to being vase, they will have other responsibilities".
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district administration, strongly disagrees with this description.
But he pointed out that the requirements for a university degree are also common in China for other jobs, both sexes.
As well as a requirement for subtle facial features.
Which means the question of good looks is a topic of discussion among the Chinese.
Disability or paralysis is not certain.
"He cannot allow a lame or a backless person to serve us", said Mr. Zheng.
"His image would not be good".
Liu Yi, who is guarding Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, with an apple-like face and a delicately shaped mouth.
She doesn't think the emphasis on her looks could have a sexist flair, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her mining partner, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our job is to represent the city".
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just driving merchants into the streets where they can do their business.
Every morning, a group of more than ten merchants run on foot or on bicycles to sell as many tofu and tofu as possible before being evicted.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave".
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as the rider started running, and for a time he left his wheelchair with a noodle.
Cops describe their duties as more monotonous than laborious.
"Every day is basically the same thing", said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying marketing in her spare time.
"It's a big routine.
One reason is that female police officers do not have the same powers as their male counterparts to confiscate goods from merchants.
They can only threaten to report the incident to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from the sudden public manifestations of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after false rumors spread that police killed the salesman.
More than 10 police officers or officers were injured in the night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has escaped such violence so far.
But peace can barely be guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where a police officer was on patrol that morning, more than 50 people gathered on the corner.
The police seized a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by the regulations.
The bike owner could cry all he wanted.
15 minutes away from the police, face-to-face, elbows against vehicles and quick off with the motorcycle and its owner.
Liedong, 40, a coordinator with the men's group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, coordinators are men over 40 who are now only in a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in image maintenance and image attenuation.
"Sometimes we fight verbally".
"Sometimes we fight physically", Mr. Li said in a matter of minutes.
"It's usually the public that starts with it".
The prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign.
Justice Department prosecutors cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges related to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure lobbying, Senator Lawyers reported Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican who, up until the scandal, was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair made national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensigne's office said it was "delighted" by the decision, which followed almost a year of investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action at the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Justice Department "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the subject of an investigation and that there are no plans to bring any further charges against him in this matter".
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department who claimed there was substantial evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing to violate the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents published in the New York Times in October 2009 reported that Mr. Ensign was helping Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lucrative lobby that was to silence Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about a senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a treasurer for the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after employing Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, so many documents and interviews.
As Hampton was until recently Mr. Ensign's assistant, he was exempt from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for one year.
Ethics experts say the unusual arrangement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, violated the lobbying ban.
Evidence released "showed that this was a clear case of preparing for a violation of the law", said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients under government investigation.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasons for the decision in Senator Ensigna's case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department was cautious about political suits after a number of setbacks, including last year's decision to stay the case against former Senator Ted Stevens amid allegations of misprosecution.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid their guns", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a law firm that filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"It basically indicates that high-ranking government officials are not covered by the law", she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensigna's chief legal officer, said in an interview that he was called by the Justice Department's attorney on Monday and then the next day, and told him that the department had not found any charges against his client.
Mr. Ensigna's defense team is working with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a Wednesday statement, "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he submitted to the prosecutor.
"I'm not comfortable giving details of my discussions with the Justice Department except that we think they made the right decision", he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to halt its investigation into a separate complaint in which an ethics group alleged that Ensigna's parents' $96,000 payment to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The Election Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that money meant nothing but a gift.
One company that Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job for was NV Energy, the premier Nevada company that long supported the senator.
An email from December 2008 showed that after Mr Hampton began lobbying the company, Mr Ensigna's chief of staff, John Lopez, communicated with Mr Hampton and told him that he had "hit" the Home Office about the subject matter being discussed.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
When the affair first came to light last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of the criminal investigation, his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hopes the ethics committee will quickly follow the Justice Department and close the investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada", she continued.
Cheshire community appeal to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were written in the courtroom.
Minutes after minutes, they were tweeting terrible testimony.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 tweets dealt with the rape and binding of children to beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire, Connecticut, family members, was scheduled to conclude with the official death penalty, which the jury voted for.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with requests and arguments that the court would likely take years to recover.
One of the most provocative is that the intense reporting of the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by leading reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate leak of information with outrageous details then led the jury to make a decision to influence public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to consider whether new rules should also be required in court as new technologies emerge.
"As I have experienced in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the incorporation of new technology into the courtroom will affect the rights of a fair trial for individuals", said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes's chief counsel.
Judge Jon C. Blue of the state Supreme Court briefly dismissed the allegations regarding last week's proceeds, saying the media were "curately controlled" and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury acted under public influence.
But it's probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, courts have recognized that reporting notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision that the media trial in Sheppard v. Maxwell was "carnival atmosphere".
Some believe that this crime was the inspiration for the TV show and movie "The Runaway".
Some lawyers have said that appeals courts reviewing Hayes' verdict half a century later might be surprised to hear that new rules could be needed to determine how to communicate from courtrooms, something that was unimaginable in Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile cases, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of law at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be intrigued by the idea that restricting direct communication from courtrooms could make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many high-profile lawyers for Mr. Hayes who could argue for years to hold back the sentence.
For example, lawyers also argue that Mr. Hayes' case may have been biased when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of potential jurors by showing them horrifying crime pictures when selecting a jury.
Some of the jurors said they were appalled by the photos of the victim, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The lawyers also claim that they reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed a jury that was critical of the prosecutors and that by its decision it wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to consider the weekend.
The jury was not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process may be of the utmost interest.
They objected to a verdict issued last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was being discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media was constantly stirring up a flame of emotion about this case.
"The daily rush of media, cameras, and reporters before the court", wrote the lawyer, "was something that had not been seen here in New Haven before, and it may also be a national rarity".
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that immediate reporting was more outrageous than the reports later reported and that the court police should be in control of the scope of further proceedings.
But some lawyers have demanded appeals courts with the often-used argument that social and technological changes require adjustments in the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are striving for that right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision in Dr. Sheppard's case, because of the breadth of the process, and they wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case", they wrote, "is the case of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century".
Can politeness overcome the gap?
After a campaign that was notable for its outrageous and negative nature, little decency has been shown in Washington this week.
Is this the first patriotic act of genuine cooperation between two political parties or just an illusory moment before a swift return to party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting of President Obama and parliamentary leaders did not yield any key findings on the key issues to be discussed during the session.
In any case, it was a polite discussion about the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as the definition of their shared responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party struggle.
The Wednesday public meeting of the President's deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close cooperation over the course of several months has built a mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still divides members.
And it's pretty hard to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both parties are now in a test period - testing each other's marks of collegiality and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience in the face of renewed party war.
Therefore, the Tuesday meeting and its subsequent evaluation by the participants were also conducted with minimal demands or criticism.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too vast and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the relationship that has prevailed here for the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, expenses, health care, or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November election was prepared by Washington at least quickly.
"It's not a question of whether regulatory matters have changed", said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after the election.
The election stirred up the party's emotions and then they were silenced.
It's good".
In a few issues, especially those to be discussed in the House, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding solutions.
Bush's tax cuts at the end of the year are out of date, and no one thinks it's a good thing.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, either permanently or temporarily.
Like a likely compromise on unemployment benefits simply because Republicans can't watch them support property tax cuts while denying unemployment benefits to the unemployed.
After Tuesday's White House meeting, there is already greater optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of the new opening treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution notes that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to a two-party relationship when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Rather, it's likely a period of conflict, or even inevitable, he said.
"Once the things that need to be done are done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in the short term", he said.
Wehner also expressed a widespread skepticism - that politeness would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I look at everything that happens between now and 2012 as a shadow box, where the main events take place in 2012", he said.
The reasons are largely tied to the formation of the new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of overreacting, knowing they must live up to their promises and must cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These lines of support are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, raising the retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest tasks in Washington and are expected to put the deficit pressure on the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to present their plan as an official recommendation and thus fight to get as close to that number as possible.
The biggest opposition is among the elected officials in the jury who suggest that, in financial matters, we have, at least today, little basis or willingness to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and the Republican parliament.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, with Republicans calling on Obama to address the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What will cause the shift?
The public opinion.
There's plenty of evidence that despite the party bias in the last election, most Americans still want to see two parties working together.
If it could go to the bottom, as it did in 1995, then both sides will be watching the public's reaction very closely.
Anyone threatened with a vote cut will probably change course and seek compromise.
That can be an optimistic view.
The bias and orientation are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and it appears that there has been a greater ideological divide between Obama and the Republican parliamentary leaders than there was between the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that has emerged this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on issues that still divide them.
A disclosed US document describes Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city is run by a "kleptocracy" that continues to pay part of the bribes and protection payments that come to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia said in February's records.
The police and the Federal Security Service, to a large extent, have protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They're not just collecting money from legal businesses, but also from organized crime groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy -- which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of the office" -- will take its own when the money starts to move up the ladder.
The recording, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrel, was posted via WikiLeaks on their website on Wednesday.
The record shall be based on the sources whose names have been amended.
The record was made when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accuses him of being heavily involved in corruption.
He was removed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only see minimal changes in purity.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturin, who owns a prominent construction company, have repeatedly denied corruption charges for many years, and have won several lawsuits for perjury charges.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked about proven evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirt, it's crap".
The Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will be put to a vote.
But it is unusual to encounter such details expressed in this way, in an embassy report, and it is also unheard of for foreign diplomats to do so.
"The Moscow city government and its links to criminal elements have led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' confirming that the government operates more like a kleptocracy than a government", says the report.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the world of crime and mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior and the Prosecutor's Office, as well as throughout the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts have identified a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world".
"Luzhkov is on top of it".
"Federal Security Service, Interior Ministry and militia are on second rate".
"And finally, at the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors".
"It's an ineffective system where criminal groups fill vacancies in certain areas because the city doesn't provide certain services".
The report says the FSB takes money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, "Business owners in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups) because they not only have more weapons, resources and strength than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law".
"That's why protection against criminal gangs is no longer in the cards".
The record says that while the collection of money is complex, the protection itself can already have problems; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay fast enough, their stores are closed under various conditions.
Bear has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but admitted that he has made little progress.
The embassy report says men are taking suitcases, probably loaded with cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats in his fight against corruption", said in a recent interview Georgy Satarov, director of the Moscow research team Indem.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy".
"It's not part of the political class because there are no more political classes in Russia".
Without politicians, without opposition, without power distribution, corruption is inevitable, he said.
India estimates that nationwide corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (countries ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the US embassy report in Moscow, which appeared only in the late evening hours, certainly did not arouse enthusiasm from the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov could be blamed for Moscow's shortcomings, it may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue about the solution of the problem.
In an interview with CNN with Larry King, Putin said that the documents WikiLeaks published could be fake and reacted angrily to the statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that it's our cooperation, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country", he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethically".
The Khmer Rouge veterans are forced to face the past
In a lit concrete classroom with dirty and looted walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School recalled the man who built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Moka".
"He was a good leader and cared for his people", said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "cutter" for his cruelty during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander in this remote Khmer Rouge homeland in northwestern Cambodia remains popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered their rule, long-standing loyalty is also broken in Anlong Veng.
In April, victims at the Truth and Reconciliation Forum were allowed to confront publicly those who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that for the first time explain the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers to children.
And in July, the UN and the Cambodian court together will hand down the first sentence of a former Khmer Rouge member, the former leader of the notorious Tuol Sleng violent gang, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Ghost, to 35 years in prison.
With each such advance, unrest has grown among the Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to re-engage in Cambodian society.
"There is envy and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything", said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"Life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful for them, but the regime became a symbol of evil".
"It's dividing families".
During the Khmer Rouge's rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese attacked and overthrew Pol Pot's government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its troops fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they started an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, following a UN-sponsored peace agreement, the country was led to its first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to a government that culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who survived, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters have fallen into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the days of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouge have maintained their local government positions in exchange for their weapons, their positions remain weak, as unskilled farmers.
"These people have had only minimal benefit from surrender", said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the utopic agrarian ideology of the regime".
"They were being raised without any idea of doing business".
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good", he said.
"The mosquito fed everyone".
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of everything ourselves".
The ongoing Khmer Rouge trial has also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the executives and those responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was enough to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was the regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced laborers.
On a recent steam evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to set and shadows appeared over the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable", she said.
"If there are any more prosecutions, there will be war".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court sought further suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it", he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer affairs means blinding the broken pieces", he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so we can understand each other".
The Centre has published the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, which has 75 pages and is titled "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the Ministry of Education's history booklet, which contains fewer than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng knew little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connection to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he took the book home for study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and courts", he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will prosecute".
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks, and the courts are starting to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a strong magic here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, a path of weeds and discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black sacs covered with carved sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after he died in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cell phone salesman, said she doesn't know much about the man who was cremated at the scene.
"But he has a strong spirit, and many locals come here and pray to him", she said.
Nuom Sothea was having her birthday and was planning to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing her luck.
Belarus agrees to have a proven uranium-based weapons stockpile
In a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it was giving up its highly enriched uranium stockpile, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was announced in a joint statement issued after the security summit of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
For years, the U.S. government has tried to persuade Belarus to abandon its highly enriched uranium, and it seems that they hit a rock last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the past two months, Belarus has conducted a few covert operations to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday's deal to remove the remainder of the material - about £500, according to an official speaking on condition of anonymity, as this is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, which ruled out Belarus.
And it was apparently a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit".
"This proves the process works", said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal a "very significant, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of all their high-enriched uranium reserves.
Belarus will be seventh.
Dozens of countries have done so under George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for the weapon and less enriched uranium", Lukashenko said afterwards.
"It's our commodity... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone".
"We're only using it for research purposes, that's all".
However, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and expressed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was completed Monday and was conducted by air, officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million on the program, most of it on supplying the Belarusian research institute with less enriched uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
"Everything was very carefully coordinated and managed on the basis of trust", leading to the Clinton-signed agreement, said Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nuclear Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used for weapons production.
According to the Joint Declaration, Belarus will endeavour to remove its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's brutal crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of gradual melting.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that more consistent adherence to democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the foundation for improving relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its people", he said.
The Spanish government didn't do CIA flights with gems.
The Spanish government has not made any money on CIA flights carrying Taliban and Al-Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay through Spanish territory, the US envoy to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is according to documents provided by the Wikileaks server of El País, where it is also stated that the then First Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Veg requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "may thus show that it has proper supervision of foreign aircraft flying through Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe communication accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting took place between the US Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernandez de la Veg.
The deputy prime minister said the Council of Europe's communication "put the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Veg stressed that Spain has no problem with secret service flights over its territory.
"They simply want to be informed", says Aguirre in one of the documents, "so they don't get caught unprepared".
Also, then-Secretary of State Miguel Ángel Moratinos suggested to the American ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible outlook, but by having the matter in the hands of the judges, the Cabinet had limited influence".
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that, as far as he was concerned, he did not intend to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents of the National Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense relating to CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any criminal record or any sensitive information", the Embassy explained after an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the US has expressed concerns more about "the obvious coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than about the classification of information by the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments", regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, at the lunch of the US Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the Ambassador said that "although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had already instructed his colleagues to "avoid extensive comments in order to reduce tension".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - see recital) taking action in this regard.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular will not hesitate to use any indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if the revelations could have negative consequences for the US government", he notes.
Admitted mother-killer complains on the net about maternal "care"
A young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead, and she had her own blog: "Terror in Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet calling herself "Muki".
She used this nickname from a young age, communicated with her cousin and at least one friend, both from the village of Noia in the La Coruña area, where the young woman comes from.
The news is from 2008.
To understand them, we need to know the woman's emotional life, which ABC is reconstructing with the testimony of her family members.
In 1998, a 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Tunes.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if his newborn was his, but his ex-girlfriend never let him have DNA tests.
Soon she found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
They were together for a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her in Palma for a week.
But from the content of her communication, it is clear that the relationship broke down.
In March 2008, she writes, "Alberto is kind of upset that I left work".
"When I told him, it seemed good, but now he realizes that he has to be with the baby all day and can't do what he wants".
Then she talks about the text message she just got, "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I can send your baby".
"If he doesn't like me leaving the baby with my mother", she complains, "I'll marry him when I get back".
In May, she said of her return to her home, "I'm going to go there this week, but I'm only going to stay until the 19th, because I have to go to work on the 20th, so I don't lose my place".
She explains that if all goes well, she'll take her son to her home.
"He'll be with whoever he's supposed to be with, that's me, and it's never gonna happen again in my life that I'll leave him with anyone but my mother", a dubious intention given her bad relationships.
There's another contribution in July.
When he releases this report, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"Caesar is pleased on the one hand, but not on the other".
"On the one hand, he's with me and he's pretty happy here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day".
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to go to summer school, so I'll save some money for a nanny".
17th salute and complaint.
"The big kiss from Caesar, asking me when you're coming".
"Alberto says he sent you an I don't know what video to email, look how he wants to, meet me, sex is needed".
The 30th report: "The boy is doing well, going to summer school to learn Catalan".
There's also a message about Victor, his current partner, "He's giving me money".
There are online Monika's blog posts on anime and manga.
She even had her own MySpace, now revised, where she used to be called "Muki ex-con".
"Terror in Galician (motto) ".
The last man she lived with, the guard, is expressing his regret and feeling guilty.
She doesn't want to believe it's all happening because she didn't tell him she's a single mother.
Monica entered the county jail in Palma yesterday, where she came from the detention center on Minorca.
The defendant's lawyer, Carlos Maceda, said that the defendant did not remember how it happened and that "it was not her intention to harm the child".
But before that, she admitted to drowning Caesar in a bathtub and to putting his body in a trunk.
The defense and the DA are asking for a psychiatric evaluation.
The people would win four seats in the Chamber and the PSC would lose nine seats.
With the results of 28 November, the PP could have the keynote address at the town halls of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in votes and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalonia - see below) already has a general idea of the elections, whether there is an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in national elections is usually once that compared to the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan people won 610,473 votes in the general election, compared with only 316,222 in the 2006 autonomous elections.
Last Sunday the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP voters, were to continue, the party's analysts calculated that if there were a general election, the PPC could gain 12 seats in the House, compared with the existing 8, the CiU (Convergencia i Unió, Czechoslovakia's Shoda and Union - see below) would also gain 4 seats (now 10), and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance to the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the population, the ERC (Levic Republican Party of Catalonia - see below) would lose one MP - now it has three - while the ICV (Initiative Greens for Catalonia - see below) would continue to hold one mandate, or perhaps win another.
However, the closest delivery is scheduled for May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where the people could also have a decisive influence on ending socialist rule in the four provincial capitals and on changes to the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), one of the administrations with the largest projected budget of €661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and popularists agree that the PSC could lose the councils of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Geroná, where the Socialists would not have a majority and could not turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and the ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible for that party to lose its seat in the Barcelona House of Representatives - since it needs to win at least 5% of the vote.
The PP has increased the number of votes it has won in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the Tarragona coup, where they ruled together with the PP party before the current mayor, Jose Felix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP won only 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
The people also gained in other important townships such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
The PP is currently represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan cell has given thousands of passports to al-Qaeda
In addition to seven detainees in Barcelona, three others were detained in Thailand.
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian arrested by agents of the General Information Commissioner's Office in Barcelona formed a Thai-led jihadist cell that issued passports to various al-Qaeda groups, including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the Lashkar-e-Taiba, the second group to be named was responsible for the bombings in Bombay in 2008, which killed 106 people.
The Ministry of Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aiming to ensure that the counterfeit apparatus of Al Qaeda is weakened internationally through "Operation Kampai" and "to limit its operational capabilities".
Researchers estimate that during the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, it was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then delivered to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy of Al-Qaeda so that their "fighters" could travel unpunished across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only active jihadist network in Europe, and therefore other European police units were involved in the investigation, in addition to the Thai services, and it cannot be ruled out that similar attacks in the following days will not occur in other European countries, such as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) there were other developments in Thailand, including the arrest of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the same men who ran a cell from Bangkok based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, in particular stole passports from tourists that met the requirements of Islamists.
That means the documents had to be men between the ages of 25 and 45, they had to be valid for several years and they had to be without a visa.
The investigation documents stress that no facts are known to link the Catalan detainees to the Bombay attack, although the author of the attacks, 'Lashkar-e-Taiba', was supposed to be one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before the assassination, a transfer agency sent about a thousand dollars from Catalonia, which were "invested" in buying cards in mobile phones that were later used by members of the "commando", which killed 106 people.
The police have already seized a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) calls on Mas to suspend the fiscal agreement
The President of the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) Alicia Sánchez-Voi-Camachova had the opportunity to present to Artur Masso her terms of support for his election as President of the Generalitat, which are similar to those proposed during the campaign and which have the priority of reviving the economy and abandoning risky enterprises such as the economic agreement that the nationalist leaders want to propose during their term.
The Catalan People's President has come to meet with Artur Mas with the confidence of 18 seats in parliament won in last Sunday's election, a number more than sufficient to win popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the opposition formations to hold a vote on his election.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists would like to maintain in the House until the general elections are held, but so far the talks that the Mas are holding these days with the rest of the political leaders are carried in the Catalan spirit.
As for the PP president, to gain her support for her election, "he will have to end all sovereign and liberated speech", as well as the economic agreement - similar to the one in Baskick - that the CiU leader even wanted to have voted on in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to shorten the overwhelming political apparatus of self-government and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the appointment of Masov will be discussed within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mr Mas has already met with Joaquin Nadale (PSC), who promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert River (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaridad Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that no deaths were caused by "lack of measures"
Olot's performance doesn't rule out their caregiver killing more than 11 clients.
The management of the La Caritat de Olot geriatric center (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday to describe the damage done to the institution by criminal behaviour of Joan Villa Dilma, a caregiver who, while employed here, killed at least 11 seniors in his care.
The director of the home for the elderly, Joan Sala, accompanied by the facility's lawyer, Joan Canady, announced that "the wishes of La Caritat could lead to charges against the perpetrator" of the murder, but "the law and responsibility obliges us to hand over the process to the authorities".
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer from not detecting the criminal activities of the caregiver in time, the demands for compensation for the victims' families are now a major threat to the La Caritat home.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime took place in August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight of the clients of the nursing home on the suspicion that in many cases the deceased had not been personally examined by a doctor but that - given the age and poor health of the patients - everything had been arranged by telephone.
Last week, through its Director, La Caritat strongly rejected this extreme and stressed that 'the lack of measures could not in any way be the cause of what happened'.
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no evidence in the case that any third party other than the defendant himself made a mistake".
A man now dubbed the "Angel of Death" admitted to 11 murders yesterday, specifying that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009, and a month and a half later he killed the second old woman.
In this case, the cause of death was an excessive dose of insulin, unlike the first time he used a mixture of sedative tablets.
The Director of La Caritat said that it was difficult to control staff access to medicines.
Insulin and a sedative cocktail were probably, in six of the nine cases, the means that this caregiver used to kill patients in his attempt to relieve them of suffering.
However, it is only through the analysis now underway in the laboratory that Vila should be able to determine whether he was lying and actually seeking a less brutal death for his first victims or, on the contrary, whether he killed them by throwing a shotgun, as he has already admitted in the case of three women killed between October 12 and 17.
La Caritat does not believe medical claims, nor does it rule out that the death toll may be higher than he admitted, and justifies his behavior in various versions that Vila submitted to the court knowing that he must change his behavior when it was revealed that he killed eight people.
So they say they want justice available to shed light on the full extent of the matter.
The European Central Bank is threatened
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat yesterday by the President of the European Central Bank, Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to respond".
The marginal differences closed by force and European banks' shares fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to be wrong - the euro has just surpassed its critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that, although it is falling, is recovering - but thanks to short and highly speculative positions.
It's gonna take the investor a while to lose his fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to recall liquidity today, and tomorrow it will have to recall for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank requested the termination of the default repurchase plan and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within the deadline and the unrestricted access for one week only.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to forecast liquidity rates 'at least until March' and to hold a three-month bid with unlimited access until the end of this quarter to guarantee liquidity until at least June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase programme and even announce its intensification.
If they don't meet the expectations they've created, they'll re-create the market reaction of yesterday, and if they continue to blindly drop liquidity, God be with us!
It was the same thing at the convention in May, where they said they weren't even considering buying bonds, and there was a market crash - tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and resilient.
In May, the armored hand announced on Monday and on Wednesday it said it had bought many, triggering another market crash.
Yesterday's one-year exchange bidding in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro only issued 500 million with 5,28%, compared to 750 million with 4,81% of the previous auction.
The Commission therefore found that the rates in Portugal were 30 points lower, reflecting the change in market sentiment which occurred, as stated by Tricheta.
In Ireland, the figures represent losses of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts are about $10,000 million in short-term securities and a further 15,000 potential investors have a chance to become private equity by February, or else they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after not revealing the problem in stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the aid scheme and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get the new budget approved by parliament and still lacks sufficient support, so there is still uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has tempered her speech to ease the tension in the face of the next EU summit on 14 December, which calls for a political compromise that shows that we are the union and we are all on the same boat.
The problem is, Germany wants to play Wagner, while others prefer Beethoven's Ode to joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity yesterday to present a plan of action to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment - to investors, it sounds like four years from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapater explains why the Spanish stock market has grown by 4,5%, twice as much as other European exchanges.
Unlike in February, the government and the Spanish National Bank reacted quickly and convincingly - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today we have a key three-year bond bid that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which we hope will create a high demand that will help dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
To ask for a rescue plan would be for Spain to sacrifice itself.
They'd give us cash we don't need - there's $40,000 million in cash available in El Tesoro, three times as much as in March - higher rates and we'd be shut down sine die.
However, the strategy of Caesar's wife must continue - "not only to be, but also to dream".
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen Group will attack the negotiations of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm in the open conflict between the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not going to stop.
David Álvarez, the group's founder, attacks after he considered it 'totally insignificant' the El Enebro legal action scheduled for 16th of this month and demanded that five of his seven descendants try to force their majority and seize power with the help of the administrative authorities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are joining a legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over control of a part of the company.
The founder of the largest business services holding company does not appear to be willing to settle the dispute over membership in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
five of its seven descendants, who were appointed as leaders at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year, were removed from its management board and whose objections are entered in the Trade Register.
The El Enebro group trial scheduled for the 16th of this month, convened by the official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, has once again revived the thunder in the belly of the Alvarez family.
An appeal to the judge shall be the only legal remedy which guarantees a commission until the dispute is resolved.
The final step of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elvira Álvarez of Mezquiriz considers David Álvarez to be "a desperate means for his five children to serve with court rhetoric and clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the January 18 act, which was completely invalid".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal challenge to this action as 'totally insignificant'.
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to get the court to call a hearing in June.
in El Enebro, a group which owns, along with other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, the seven descendants of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
However, the group founder claims, under family protocols, a right to use 51% of the capital.
This is a key issue for the judge to decide when he or she is adjudicating the case.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula One with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software suggests real-time improvements in vehicles.
Ever since Red Bull entered Formula One in 2004, its history in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the newly arrived team's chances too seriously, and despite the recent upward trend, everyone was betting on Ferrari's Fernando Alonso triumph.
Without wanting to diminish the riding abilities of the champion German Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine that drives his car, a legend was born in the Formula One world - the "secret weapon" that multinational Siemens put into the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful walking simulation software that the German company launched in 2007 for the purposes of very long distance motorsport.
PLM, this powerful software tool, has been used to design assembly lines in factories around the world, in power plants and for high-precision machinery.
It aims to faithfully reproduce a product or simulate a process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expense.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous Nissan commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that using this software tool enabled the Red Bull team to make modifications and improvements "in a matter of hours, in near real time", which would otherwise be detected during racing and testing.
Russwurm says that in 1992 the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements in a single period.
Red Bull's team now employs 180 highly skilled young professionals equipped with high-performance information technology to analyze and design every type of race car modification.
The Siemens manager explained that PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull racing cars except the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can be made from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced laser manufacturing systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical feat is $40 million, which is the maximum that any Formula One team can spend in each season to improve their competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a state-of-the-art racecourse about 50 km from London to design and manufacture its race cars.
These are two buildings that are restricted to visitors - especially journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a "great mystery".
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is undoubtedly the new Formula One champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, the enormous technological resources that the energy drink brand has invested in its participation in racing circuits are also the source of other protagonists whose help is invaluable and yet unknown.
Production technology chief Steve Nevey says that five years ago, it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to a 50% victory and the rest was drivers' credit.
Today, that ratio has changed, and technology accounts for 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computational technology, as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will set up 20 stores in two years in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in cooperation with its business partner Pont Reyes opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
This enterprise will be the first of a network of 20 stores of 80 to 100 m2 that this multinational company plans to open in Spain over the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing shops such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's Vice President Helena Herrer cited as an example the newly renovated shop on Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish outlets.
The first stores opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), while the third store in Barcelona.
Herrer did not want to reveal where the next shops would open, but she acknowledged that Madrid could be one of the next places.
Herrer, who also heads HP's systems staff, ensured that the philosophy of opening stores will remain the same - using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company advises on the exclusive design of equipment sold (with products that can be interactively tested) which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also involved in staffing the stores.
Helena Herrer denied that it was a franchise, stressing that the exclusive network of sales is aimed at "improving customer service, services to SMEs in purchasing, servicing, after-sales service and even packaging".
The Barcelona business is part of a world-class pilot pilot programme to address any problems with warranty computers.
The online service is linked to the Technical Centre in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So we can solve problems in 10 minutes that could otherwise take up to two days".
'This system is specifically designed for SMEs and regular customers, given that large companies already have a contractual technical assistance service,' said Helena Herrer yesterday.
Sabadell's betting on stealing a million clients from its competitors in three years.
More optimistic than other bank managers, Banco Sabadell's deputy chairman, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a challenging year for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it is expected to reduce interest rates, which will be compensated by lowering bank charges and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to gain a million private clients in three years.
Sabadell found a way to use the next three years to survive the economic hardships.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan for three years in 2011.
In addition to surviving without having to rely on public assistance at FROB, the aim is to gain market share by attracting one million new private clients - 700,000, if those who leave the bank are excluded - as the institution has hitherto been more concerned with small and medium-sized enterprises and large enterprises than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share for private clients is 3,5%, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
The Bank's financial position is based on the financial position of the Bank in the financial year 2011-2013.
Few banks are now daring to set targets and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all plans for global banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima programme this year, set up four years ago, although it was originally set for three years, but the market situation required an extension to another period.
Clients who leave the savings will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be "difficult and very important".
He believes that the road from the crisis in Spain will be "long".
In addition, in two or three years, it will be "very difficult to create jobs", he added, which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector.
And while they believe that the passive war - which reduces margins - is receding, the price of the risk premium that banks and savings banks pay for their emissions to get liquidity is already shifting to loan prices, compensating for the reduction in margins.
'The issue of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on loans.'
"We haven't closed the door yet, but the differentials are very high", Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued orders to its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and increase the price of the differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "is now to cut commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
The strategic plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth, but as usual the Group does not exclude corporate operations.
It assures us that in Spain "greater sizes will be demanded".
"Next year, there won't be a stone left on the stone", he assured.
It confirms that the capital needs are 'significantly reduced' and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions will be included in the red list.
It also shows that the FROB can overcome the market for fundraising before the new capital measure.
After assuring Sabadell that it can survive the temporary market closures, what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis continues to pose a serious problem.
It notes that it is not possible to issue, but unlike in June, it is possible to obtain short-term financing through repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of merger of the greenhouse gas
The Director-General of CECA yesterday rejected the possibility of a further wave of merger and insisted again on the pace of the sector's reorganisation.
When the process of bringing together Spanish savings banks began, several institutions assured that they would not participate in the first phase and would wait for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of the Savings and Loan Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out a new wave of such operations.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been completed, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Civica group cannot be considered a second round, what is happening are conventions".
"Most of the work is complete; we may go to 13 or 14 institutions instead of 17 but all the major processes are already complete and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has worked very well on this issue", the director noted.
In his statements at the meeting of the ADEA (Aragon Association of Executives and Directors), Olavarrieta said that the concentration process was taking place 'at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the results of the payments which, in his time, not now, appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank'.
"The move from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process unprecedented in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them larger and thus in line with the Treaty of Basel", he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of unfortunate views about the slowdown in the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us that we must be on time before the end of the year".
The CECA Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the strictest financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and accused those who questioned this of "lack of knowledge".
The Director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can be confident" about financial institutions and that the system that has managed the "very important" concentration process and is continuing "at the highest possible speed" has also been spared.
It also recalled that Spanish banking performed very well in the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the red German lines
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole Union.
The tensions in the markets have provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, ranging from reducing taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private intermediaries or the abolition of EUR 426 for unemployed persons without benefits, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic management - see recital), the managers of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgadova, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, joined criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility for the current crisis.
How do you interpret this move?
Let me just say that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in a complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is going to be, which refers to the idea of keeping to old traditions that a large part of the rest of the membership holds.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, for example, while the southern countries would leave the currency zone.
The second is the return to the march -- although it may now seem like science fiction, this version has broad public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to the German proposals, is to restructure the euro with greater macroeconomic oversight, budgetary constraints, fines for the guilty states, possible deferrals in payments for some of them, and with the extension of possible regulatory costs to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for a draw now.
First, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission stimulated deficits in 2009, the German government pulled out of the hand of constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a conflict between what Germany considered to be correct (fiscal rigidity and public finance stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by this Central European country, when Merkel painfully challenged the Greek rescue decision.
Already at the time, it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion that was also published were strongly against saving Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again came out with a clear stance when she called for reforming the European Union's conventions to allow a rescue of a Member State while also making private creditors liable to bear some of the costs.
This opinion has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although somewhat mitigated, was approved and we should follow the Union's reform process over the coming months, which should allow for such measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it will not cross.
And it tells us that while measures are now needed that it seems to disagree with, from this date on, the old functioning of the euro will be over.
The year 2013 will mark the birth of a new currency zone, where countries that break the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to declare deferred payments, and the private sector will also have to bear some of the costs.
Germany is suggesting that we must take a strong path of growth with increased savings and investment, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on debt and building, with huge gaps in balance of payments, such as Spain's booming years, simply won't be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand.
This is not just a matter of restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much tougher.
And the worst part is that under these conditions, we may be wrong.
I hope these current turbulences will replace more calm.
And that we'll take advantage of the opportunity they're giving us until spring 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero seems to have understood this too, and his two statements (the reforms promised after meeting with big business last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggest that despite criticism of Merkel, the idea of putting things in order has opened up.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is here, and it doesn't seem to want to move.
And of the options that can be considered, leaving the eurozone full of not-so-serious countries cannot be ruled out.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us it warned us.
Sport and circumvention
The finties Alonso and Ramos showed against Ajax show wit, not intent on evasion.
The allegedly planned exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramose) from the Champions League match against Ajax on 23 November caused a sea of ink to be written on whether or not this was unsportsmanlike behaviour and whether UEFA should not punish both players.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won), the nominees deliberately wasted time one after the other at the time the foul was to be played to provoke the referee, who showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet their penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid finishing top of their group - and will be able to proceed to the next stage, having been stripped of their card.
In the end, UEFA's disciplinary committee fined coach José Mourinh for two games and the guilty players were fined.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It's so widespread that it's part of the ethos of football, which is rules that are unwritten, but followed.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that the participant was the Real Madrid team (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and which already punished its players for similar acts), and also apparently due to the dramatization led by Mourin, who thus adds to his long history of comedian and provocateur another episode.
In any event, the debate is whether this kind of action, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether there is circumvention of the law in the act; it is indeed an action respecting the rules of sport, the meaning of which, however, seems to be circumvented.
The damage caused by such conduct to the spirit of sport is determined.
One of the characteristics of sporting conduct is the physical integrity of the opponents, which was not violated in these cases, i.e. no violent play occurred.
Another feature of pure play is to avoid giving players an advantage over an opponent's team because of their offense - which has not happened here either.
So the paradox of the Real Madrid players' actions is that what we normally call a deception or circumvention of the law, there was no hidden violation of the rules to avoid sanctions, but rather that this behavior was to be as obvious as possible to get punishment.
They waited and were happy to get the punishment.
The next question is, however, what benefit will those guilty of their deliberate transgression gain?
It must be noted here that the opponent is not placed at a disadvantage and that he will not gain any advantage in the current match, as the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And that's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club won't be able to count on those players.
The advantage is obviously that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could jeopardize their participation in the future match.
However, this is a long-term advantage with a certain degree of uncertainty, so at first glance the team can be eliminated, and yet by doing so, the players will reverse their punishment and move on to the second round of cards, where one card is enough to eliminate the first round.
So as the wheels continue, it's not entirely clear if this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations are not against the spirit of sport, which includes making strategic decisions that allow for maximum benefit under the rules.
In the case we're dealing with, players were not meant to avoid punishment (which would be a clear case of circumvention), but rather to choose when to submit to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding punishment or running away from it.
Although the line between wit and circumvention is not entirely clear, I believe that it was clearly wit in this case.
I think the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusions and because of the way the instructions were passed on to the management to provoke them.
The violation of sporting principles by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
A bidding war for a Christmas party in Barcelona
The calendar dictatorship is concentrating the reservation avalanche on December 16 and 17.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros, are on the rise.
Like Turkish honey or lotteries, with the advent of December, there are also pre-Christmas parties that still act as an oxygen bomb for Barcelona restaurants and leisure facilities, but the crisis has led to a struggle to win customers by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food, according to businessmen and associations in the sector.
To complete the complication of the count, the calendar this year (when Christmas Day fell on a Friday) has concentrated on requests for the week of 13 December, creating an avalanche of reservations for peak days (16 and 17), while there was almost no traffic in the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean years began, many companies have cancelled their collective parties for budgetary reasons.
To keep up with tradition, many employees pay for party expenses out of their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many are demanding prices on the verge of abduction, says the president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona restaurant association, Gaieta Farras.
The restaurant's patronage is not daring to predict what the festivities will be like this month.
"People will think it over before they make a reservation".
"They want to go out, but they're careful about prices", he adds.
The stores are going well for those "who offer quality and good service at a favorable price", he says, recalling that the crisis has led to a tendency for customers to go down and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey of various facilities shows that the biggest demand for bookings is on the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group is reporting a real booking boom this Friday, with the highest demand for losses of up to €30, which has enabled the menus offered, with prices ranging from €25 to €30.
In another important company, Andilana, which has 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda, etc.), the special feature of this year's calendar has been more timely bookings since the beginning of November.
"We have done our best and impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menus, which should be chosen by everyone, range from 19.95 to 30 euros", they say.
The AN Grup group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, remains optimistic after seeing a profit increase since the second half of the year and has a fairly solid outlook for Christmas sales.
Sources at the company stress that December 18 will also be a busy day as friends celebrate Christmas Eve.
The six group menus were accompanied by a Christmas menu, with a budget of €30 or more, as they showed a tendency to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine).
They also noted that companies are already appearing to call their employees back, and the size of groups seems to be a little larger.
Vice President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Barcelona Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Centre Association) Enric Goma believes that the end of the tunnel is beginning to be seen and claims that the number of reservations has "liven up", although clients "contracts to the maximum".
This impression has not diminished during the Christmas celebrations, whoever pays, whoever points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program has caused great unrest in the United States
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country".
WikiLeaks documents confirm the Taliban and Pakistan have ties.
The content of correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department published by WikiLeaks confirms the extraordinary unrest that Pakistan's nuclear program has sparked in Washington.
In addition to the clarifying and significant details they offer on the content of the communications and the ideas of North American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states on nuclear security is "retreating" rather than increasing, and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - its weapons are not assembled but stored in pieces to facilitate their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is what the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, calculated in a report before visiting the then National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to Taliban-held territory, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transporting nuclear materials".
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and a guided missile program is no longer seen by the United States alone but also by Russia as spreading and providing a reason to be on the alert.
"Pakistan had to hire personnel with a strong religious belief to protect its nuclear facilities; with declining education and culture levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear or guided missile programs", Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev told a meeting with U.S. counterparts.
The biggest news documentation released by Julian Assange's server is the ever-decreasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation and the increased pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
A letter issued by the embassy in May, which described the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", says: "Transparency often fails; offers of assistance remain unanswered or rejected".
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence Service worker for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country in the world".
Ambassador Petterson also urges Washington to "most clearly" during the visit of Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani that "the Pakistani Army must stop silent support for terrorist groups".
The hunt for the Wikileaks boss
Obama is appointing a senior counterterrorism official to avoid further information leaks.
Interpol is issuing a "red call" to track and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated maze where it's hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol yesterday announced a "special call", a so-called red notice, to "locate and monitor the movement" of Assange.
But this is not a classic arrest warrant.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but it's dated November 20.
And it's not about the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but about the sexual abuse allegations that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assang".
It was on 20 November that the International Police Service, based in Lyon, France, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but it did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this context, 188 countries have instructed Interpol to identify or locate Assange "with a view to imposing temporary detention and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a person on the red alert, many Member States, as the organisation explained, consider the red notice to be an option for the arrest - this must be ensured by the national police force - especially when the states have a bilateral agreement on the release of the detainees, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be located.
This move was offended by Assenge's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter stating that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks had expressed a willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assenge had asked and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, whom they compare to the legendary Lavrenti Pavlovic Beria, head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt, not a legal pursuit", the letter reads.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother is defending her son's innocence from Australia - Assange is still in an unknown location, but he's not silent.
On Monday, he interviewed Time magazine's editor-in-chief via Skype from an unknown location - in which he demanded the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering US diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violate international conventions that the United States has signed, she should resign", he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website", he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Traverse, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's intention to stop adding importance to Assange contrasts with the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a congressman who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, asked the State Department to investigate whether to include WikiLeaks in terrorist organizations "to intervene and prosecute anyone who contributes or otherwise provides financial assistance to them".
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went further, stating that Assange should "be killed", which he had to appeal.
"Obama should write a reward on him or use a drone or something".
The one who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a potential presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in government, whoever is responsible for the leak, has committed treason, and any punishment other than death would be too mild", he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC by "sniffing" on Caroda's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret on its stay.
Huguet proposes more plural executive power and an end to the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós apparently found a recipe for fighting the internal revolt in the ERC, which was unsuccessful due to the loss of 11 MPs and half the vote.
The party chairman is aware that his resignation gesture seems insufficient to the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Caroda-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weak as his leader himself, and that he cannot be as concerned as he was with other faded currents.
So the leader of the Left will try to get new criticism by using blinking to help him get to the polls.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to speak in secret to his stay in office.
By voting, not by raising your hand.
If Caroda's supporters want to pass a criminal verdict on to the president, they can do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid division and subjugation of his own person.
In several interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added, without specifying a percentage, that it would not be a good result "after Bulgarian".
Caroda's supporters demand more from the president than to make his office available - a gesture they consider to be of no importance, since Puigcercós controls the largest body at the assemblies.
But since they don't have a majority to force resignations, they'll try to recall the plan from now until May.
They therefore expect to participate in the drafting of a strategic reorientation document, which the management will vote on at the National Council on the 18th of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcercose in return for his promise to move Congress back to the fall of 2011.
The ERC leader said that "multiple-talk" is damaging stability and that his goal is to make the organization once and for all able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context, it seems that a distinctive article was signed on his blog by current adviser Josep Huguet.
After considering Puigcercós' ideologist, this innovation adviser took it for granted that a leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several goals".
And he named five, two of which are excellent.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the members, which means including new faces from the Carod-favoured sector.
The second target could be big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should completely cease meeting as a functioning mechanism.
And so he's fighting for a constitutional reform so congresses can be held through delegates elected by vote.
The end of the meeting system, with the exception of the Spanish political party system, is the intended aim of the Puigcercós team, which has been fighting in this direction at the last two meetings.
However, the 2008 Constituent Assembly decided that the membership must be assessed at a special congress on statutory reforms.
The matter remains unresolved as the situation within the party has deterred the parties from addressing the matter.
Now, with no critical sectors looming, it might be a good time to re-engage in this matter and try to close it once and for all.
23 killed in November; 390 in 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico has seen a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to the MILENIO newspaper.
Among the murders, three women are among the most high-profile and a pair of separate bodies were found in the Valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, there were 390 murders in Mexico, probably linked to organized crime.
Among the most notable cases is the discovery of a body in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in Toluca County.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a blunt force trauma to the head and had her hands and legs tied with rope.
The next day, a body was found in a trunk that was placed in the trunk of a vehicle over Mixtecas Street in the Santa Cruz Acatlán Colony in Naucalpan County.
Early Thursday morning, November 4, cooperatives discovered a body bearing marks of torture and at least three fatal shots to the chest off the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a message, probably signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacan.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was shot and killed in Nezahualcoyotl by eight gunmen after he left his home to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two 30-year-old victims were shot in the head in San Pedro Xalaxtoc Colony, Ecatepec County.
In Chalco, a man's body was found on a long road in the colony of El Naranjo, shot in the head, and a .25 caliber machine gun was found beneath the body.
In Ecatepec, human body parts were found in a sewage channel in the Playa Golondrina colony.
Rescue teams searched for other parts of it, but they never found them.
Tepotzotlán residents have reported finding a body with their hands tied behind their backs and their heads wrapped at the scene of a pen-colored shooting.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back.
In mid-March, a murder of two men was reported, wrapped in their bedroom linen and left in the vehicle's luggage compartment in Villas de la Hacienda, Atizapán de Zaragoza, and the victims were also reported to have faced death threats.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in Los Reyes La Paz.
A body was found in a nearby colony, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a report from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in a bedroom linen in the village of Zoquiapan in Ixtapaluca County, and the next morning, a dead man was found wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet in Huixquilucan, who was provisionally identified as Mario Ríos, according to a report the killers left with his body.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman with no signs of life was found in the San Francisco Acuautla neighborhood with two wounds to the back.
The woman's skin was marked with a tattoo of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death") and necklaces with her likeness.
At the end of the month, a man with at least three gunshot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group was found dead in a car in the town of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads wrapped in a ribbon were found in the municipality of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The victim was reportedly being held by a criminal organization that said, "This is what happens to those who don't adjust".
Two bodies were found in Ecatepec, bearing torture marks and bound limbs inside an abandoned taxi outside the San Agustín Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in Los Reyes, La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl counties.
The first was cut and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón, wrapped in black plastic bags, bound with a tape and left with a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic pack on the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Along with him, agents found a message card.
China is meeting its greenhouse gas reduction target
The representative of this country at the UN Climate Change Conference COP16 assured that his country had made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and specified that it was sticking to its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at the UN Climate Change Conference.
In his first public speech to the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million over the past four years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he stated that China would not change its objectives and would continue to work with the international community on this issue.
He pointed out that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has already been made on all these points, including last year's approval of a new energy law that includes proposed targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
It also stressed that in China, the federal authorities have been working in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their targets in terms of energy savings, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
He also said that various multiannual plans, funded by both the Chinese and foreign governments, are underway or have already been completed.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investment from the UN, governments and private initiatives.
The provincial climate change project, the light bulb replacement project and the mitigation and adaptation project, are also underway.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's climate change adviser, assured that China's efforts were greater than is generally believed.
For example, he estimated that per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are 6 tons, while in the United States, they are 100 tons; China accounts for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts to use energy - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
The exclusion of Espino is legalized: César Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party - see recital) stated that the former Chairman of the PAN party is entitled to claim his right to the National Order Commission.
The National President of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos was legalized and that the former President of the PAN was entitled to contact the National Order Commission and claim his rights.
In an interview with the State Governor Gabin Cué Monteagudem before the objection, he said that the exclusion of Espina was in any event a decision taken at local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Commission of Ordinary Affairs".
'Mr Espino has the right to appeal in his case to the National Council's Organising Committee by means of a complaint to consider a decision taken by a competent authority,' it added.
He also explained that this is not the time to think about 2012 and that she has never been at the negotiating table for the Alliance's presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that the PAN will be strengthened by the internal elections on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (the 2012 Alliance) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not yet, it was a local election intention that was successful and fulfilled its purpose", he stressed.
The PAN President said that he supported 71 years of dialogue and that "we are not afraid of internal competition, but rather we are benefitting from it and it strengthens us".
He said the committee can elect the best chairman or chairperson the PAN deserves for the next three years without debate, so he'll hand over the staff to "who the committee will appoint".
"I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, and I will proudly hand over the office of party chairman to any of the five".
He predicted that the rise the party recorded in the last election in July would be reflected in future clans, although "it's not time to think about 2012 yet".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task".
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, with their roots in the alliances of Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloe, would be the flag and the object of nationwide observation, because "many expectations and aspirations are placed in them, and I am sure Gabino will live up to those expectations".
When asked about the criticism of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party, no. c. transl.) for his speeches during his four years in office, César Nava urged PRI members to think about the six-year terms of former presidents Ernest Zedill and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedilla and Salinas were better than the governments of Fox and Claderon, let them start defending them, let them get out of their own way", he asserted.
He said the head of the federal executive has the right to speak as he did during his speech in the National Auditorium, since there is no dress code or censorship in this country.
Obama promotes a bill on Twitter to support students without papers
"If you think the passage of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it", the president tweeted on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined a national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which would legalize students without documents, today via his Twitter account.
"If you think the passage of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it", Obama tweeted.
His brief message highlights an Internet link to a more comprehensive document urging the public to immediately contact the senators as the vote on this bill draws near.
"Since the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard", he points out.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block passage of any legislation unless Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as ratifying a new treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, called START.
When asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a schedule could be drawn up for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there is still enough time left... "
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year"...
I believe we can reach an agreement on this at some point and then we can schedule the rest of the affairs", he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would seek a "vote to close the debate" on the Dream Act so that a bill to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, though it's more likely next week.
The Senate passing the Dream Act, or the "American Dream", would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before they turned 16, lived in the country for the past five years, and were accepted into higher education or the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to pass the bill, and they need the help of a few Republicans, so the organizations of its supporters are running an intense campaign to get the bill passed.
The Democrats, whose majority supports the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has voiced his opposition, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has voiced his support for the bill.
That's why the Dream Act supporters need to get a few Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom supporters negotiate the most are Senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as the outgoing Senator from Florida George Lemieux, who added to the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they have said they will not back it next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John Mccain, has not yet spoken.
Although the House of Representatives is moving to a different version, most analysts believe the Dream Act will face the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
literature put a finger in a wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put a finger in a wound" is similar to Czech "to hit a nail on the head - no. translations.)
The second round of the Language Pleasures series was a walk-in event where participants presented a literary gala performance
"I understand Sex in Language, but... What's in it for me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second round of Pleasure in Language, a cycle celebrating literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used as a subtitle on the occasion (at another round table fair, she explained, the theme was Sex in Language).
"It's a pain in the ass", the Argentine writer said to a crowd of mostly young people who had gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair to hear the debate at the round table, moderated by Marisol Schultzova and attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramirez, Mayra Monter and Luisa Garcia Monter.
Louise Valenzuel read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celori, which Schultz later described as a great story, in which she played Louise in the first person as a protagonist who goes from doctor to doctor in search of knowledge of what a "wound" is, and who does not give her the answer, although she does not know the answer to the same story.
She leaves the infestation specialist convinced, "Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound".
Finally, after being frustrated with the trauma specialist who took her breath away in the middle of the road but explained that wound is not a scientific term, it's the psychoanalyst who will reveal the secret: "wound represents what is really open and the symbolic is scar".
The protagonist sighed with a soft sigh and concluded that "she only knew about the wound that it was really open and that it didn't exist", but she became convinced that the pleasures and the stimuli of language must go hand in hand.
The writer Valenzuel played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also came up with a lovely story he called "The Praise of Invention", in which the finger in the wound is not named, but appears at a moment's notice.
With elements of magical realism, it tells of a famous witch who played clouds, brought back people who had gone far, or restored the integrity lost by a virgin, this tale that then turned to America to speak, a great novel that from the beginning was not lacking in its own chroniclers who told it, and it is quoted by Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the exaggeration of the narrative of the conquering captains.
"Cervantes, who invented us all, ridiculed the shamed testimony that was presented as real in the stories, but never otherwise managed to tell the story of America with such creativity that it lacked even shame".
However, he stressed, "it is the fools and liars who have the greatest imagination" and it is where reality and lies merge, where it is no longer known what belongs to one group and what belongs to another, that fictional literature reaches its peak.
It's called the Cervantes tradition.
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have".
Mayra Monter then emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation to the International Book Fair with her phrase Finger in the Wound enabled.
A Cuban-Portuguese writer has pointed her finger at the great wave of social violence that is sweeping her country - and Latin America shares it - as a result of drug trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think good literature, good poetry and good songs make a silent compromise, which of course is not intended", she said, after stating that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical reaction".
The evening was closed by Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized "the finger in the wound of the writer bound by the writer".
He said that in a world of haste, including intellectual habits and control of conscience, which overwhelms dogmatism, it is forgotten that "behind every temptation is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
"To be masters of our thoughts and realities, we must be mastering: and mastering means putting a finger in a wound many times and harassing those individuals who are much more comfortable because they think in cartoons, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without color, and harassing also the authorities who prefer this black and white world", he said, to support the meaning of writing.
Romano is going for his first title.
Ruben Omar Romano has three defeats in the final, he has had his ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the final three times.
In the final, Santos Laguna and Monterrey will face off against two different styles, with their techniques, teams that have a marked difference in results.
Ruben Omar Romano has three defeats in the final, he has had his ups and downs in his career, but he has already made it three times in the deciding series, but so far he has left with a broken leg, and that's why this opportunity is special for him.
The Argentine had to settle for a silver medal, stayed one step behind the winner and curiously played the same team in the next final.
Santista Strategic reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura tournament, when he was in charge of Morelia, with whom he lost 4-2 to Toluca; then in the 2003 Clausura tournament he again advanced to the decisive duel and also lost it with an overall score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna in the 2010 Torneo Bicentenario, once again against the "Dejans" of Toluka, Rubén suffered a defeat again, although his team played against the "Uzenarios" (another nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - see below) after 210 minutes of play undecided 2-2, after a series of penalty shoot-outs he got to the advantage three to one and had two chances to seal the title, but in the end his three players passed 11 steps and the team suffered a turnaround to 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals to the Red Devils of Toluka and one to Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and celebrate the title for the first time, although he says his most important institution is his institution.
"I want to come out as a winner, I don't want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I'm committed to, and the title would be obviously for me, but the first one is the most important", the coach said when asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
In his vivid memory of the previous final, where he confirms he learned a lot, "we learned that until the referee finishes, we can't celebrate, we have to be ready for action, and so do the players, because the last two penalties, we were ready to run to celebrate, and I think we learned that until the match is over, we can't celebrate".
He's not worried that the series could be decided by a penalty shoot-out, he believes his players: "You never try to get to a penalty shoot-out, you try to finish in normal time, but sometimes there's no other option and we have to be prepared for it, last tournament we were prepared, but unfortunately fate has set us up for a wrong move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety we felt when we had the title in our hands, but we lost it, it left something in us and we hope that this time something like this won't happen".
Romano has a chance to stop being the second and experience for the first time the glory that titles bring.
The United States Amends the Rules for Visa
People will have to go to the Visa Applicant Services Centre before the interview at the Consular Department; costs will be lower and waiting times will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa negotiation process at the U.S. Embassies and Consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Visa Applicant Service Centre (ASC) before the interview at the Consular Department.
The ASC staff will collect the applicant's biometric information and will be evaluated by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including:
The total cost of issuing a visa will be lower, with no more fees for arranging a meeting, one for processing an application and another for delivering a document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee covering all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including temporary workers' visas) and $390 for a business and investor visa.
People wishing to renew their visas will not have to interview a consular officer, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and have their fingerprints taken.
As biometric information will be collected at the ASC, applicants who will require a second interview with the Consular Section will spend less time here than in the past.
Also, those who apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer be charged an extra fee of $26 for the service.
For more information on the new visa application procedure, please visit the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The U.S. Space Agency has called a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could break the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, spread and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
In inviting journalists, NASA assured that it would present "a discovery that will break the search for extraterrestrial life", prompting speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us living in inhospitable conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and that could present the possibility that they might one day become intelligent creatures like humans if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any life form because the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it's this ability that increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that don't have the atmosphere of Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another, second life form, different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the actual impact of the findings at a press conference tomorrow.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan, Saturn's largest moon, with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón are producing an opposition 'block'
The constitutional reforms of Congress are leading to the advent of "bipartism", they declare.
The 60th parliamentary term was not yet started when the opposition bloc was formed in Congress, led by the members of the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democrática), the PT (Partido del Trabajo), Convergencia (Czech "Covenant") and the independently declared Jesu Manuel Patrón Montalvo, and the four discussed one thing: the entry of "bipartism" into the Senate.
Before the start of the session for the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD and Patrón Montalvo "favored" the reform of the constitutional law because it excludes them.
This reform, they repeated, begins "bapartism", because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four Members of Parliament, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, the PRD Coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Council, led by Salvador López Britt from the PAN (Partido Acción) and Luis Cardenas Fonseca as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms constitute institutional political marginality at the urging of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech for 'Revolutionary Institutional Party') and the PAN.
He said that in the coming days they would talk to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme based on political will, and if they do not have it, they would be subjected again by the two parties, ending the opposition coalition.
"When it's over, I'm watching it because we're excluded from any decision, and they're not even willing to consider the opinions of others".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that they agree with PRD, PT and Patrón and therefore will form a plurality group.
It is impossible to allow, he continued, that Congress, after being monopoly, is now "duopoly".
The aspiration of the law reform is not to have endless bipartisanism in Congress.
The group started with five lawmakers and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT explained that the Congress has now become "use" of two - in reference to the PAN and PRI parties.
"Once it was dominated by one party, now it is divided by two".
Patrón Montalvo asked for the respect of the personality of the MP to be given a seat at the table.
"So that the five of us, who are probably now nine, but they see us as five right now, not left out because of the covenants, each in a different faction, we have united to find a seat at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform they have created and agreed to, we stand out, and we disagree with this reform".
Another 200,000 pesos are being spent on the "supplier"
The mayor of Mazatlán will pay another check to the owner of the dispute-based electrical equipment company.
Another check for a little over 200 thousand pesos was sent by the city hall to Lorena Guadalupe Camach of Palazuelos.
This brings the amount paid to the owner of the electrical equipment company in the second half of this year to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the City Council, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November of this year, was issued for a fee of 200 144,56 pesos and was subject to 'settlement of outstanding payments'.
The municipality will pay this supplier, which has been monitored by the Supreme Audit Office for selling at high prices, another fine.
What hasn't been said is the total amount the city council still owes her and how many checks will be sent to Camach Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought now, only what we owe her is being paid, as are other suppliers", he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the last on November 16.
Although the businessman has not yet been published in the Government Gazette, as the law states in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the treasurer assured that she did not re-use the services of the City Manager.
In the past, after 25 July, the Noroeste newspaper published a review of the checks issued by the municipalities to their suppliers, which revealed that, between March 2008 and 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abela López Sánchez, the City of Camachosa Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where it collected checks worth more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist spots are in desperate need of maintenance
Tour operators complain about the accident of a foreign tourist due to the poor condition of Sanchez Taboada's Mazatlán residence.
After a foreign tourist fell deep in the Sanchez settlement, Taboady asks the tourism sector in Mazatlán to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition so as not to show the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Association of Traders, recalled that they had repeatedly asked for the impression of the destination to be taken care of, and the bad things tourists find here to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of streets and sidewalks affected tourists who passed by and saw the mess, which adversely affected businesses nearby.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a business for one day, and they have no idea what the sales are going to be, or they wouldn't have been able to handle these issues for that long and without proper planning".
Hotel manager José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist was caused by a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the city council.
'The Council will have to take responsibility and prevent this from happening again, it will have to be concerned with preventive maintenance, not just fixing existing defects,' he said.
We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, because we as residents deserve clean housing, the city council should change its strategy of maintaining the city".
There are other places that seem neglected and miserable, he noted, such as the Mastalan Emblem and El Venadito (monument, statue of a deer - see translations).
"Today, to get tourists is not just about promotion, you have to offer a good product, a city that is clean with its beaches and streets, where there is constant maintenance of tourist attractions", he said.
"There has been little attention paid to this, and these facts highlight a well-known fact, the lack of maintenance.
He spoke of a number of places that need to be cleaned up in cooperation with the city council, saying the priority must be to keep the city clean and orderly to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that rescuing tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not being used properly and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural destinations and spaces, but we will need to first put these places in order to attract them and to be able to put them on our list of places to promote the destination".
The IP is asking Congress for results.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, would like the Members of Parliament to take on a great responsibility by setting an example in seeking a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges facing the state.
A parliamentary period of dignified work and no agreement between the parties and the State Executive is demanded by the business sector in Mazatlán, as Sinaloa is in crisis and facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary session has been opened, comprising seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 PAN MPs, three Partido Nueva Alianza, two PRD, one PT, one Convergencia and one PVEM, comprising a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations from new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and the various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalistic patrons will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, chairman of the Coordination Council for Business (CCE), proposed that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take on a great responsibility and set an example on the path to a better Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
"We expect MPs to actually exercise their right, without any agreement between the parties, because they usually take measures to advance their own interests and become carnivals of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions".
He was therefore talking about confirming the commitment to establish the necessary overlap that would move the ruling party forward in order.
"We want them to do a decent job and be committed to society and the sectors first and foremost because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them their vote of confidence in the last election".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for the 40 national representatives would be to join forces to achieve the country's economic growth, as the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is that they stimulate economic growth, that they create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in some way encourage job creation.'
As regards tourism, he asked the new legislatures to give it more weight within the state budget and to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I learned that it is the second lowest budgeted ministry, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing in currencies and investments, which in addition directly competes with agriculture".
In addition to providing funds for startup tourism projects, Congress should help secure the state and help with a alcohol bill that failed to be resolved in previous parliamentary sessions.
The Three Kings are looking for you
The dolls, the car and the bicycles are on the wish list of the children in the Coronado Valenzuela family, along with other toys.
Their parents will find it difficult to fulfill their expectations about the coming Festival of the Three Kings, since their household is exactly 12 people and one lamb.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan, and Miguel do not lose hope that Caspar, Melichar, and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they long for.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poverty, since my father has no permanent job.
"Sometimes it's hard because the husband is not lucky, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with the 'sweethearts' to sell on the street", said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for 10-year-old José Alfredo, he'd wanted a monster car for a while, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana would want a year's-size dress.
"He (José Alfredo) said, 'I wish I had this monster car,' but I said, 'We'll see my son,' because it was very expensive", recalls Cayetano.
For older kids who were just in school, it would be the perfect outfit and shoes.
María Guadalupe, who is 11, is 12, Isaías, 10, and Miguel, 8, is 10.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan is missing sneakers, so he could use a pair of size five and a half or six.
To help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valencian family, you can participate in the Three Kings are on the Lookout campaign and bring a gift or cash at the Noroeste Diary reception.
14 suspected drug dealers who were arrested
A decade of searches were carried out in Estonia on Wednesday as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian hemp.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
There were patrols in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that were used to manufacture drugs.
"Approximately 750 barrels of Indian cannabis, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used to produce it were seized", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec police spokesman.
A total of 11 men and three women have been arrested, including two suspected network executives, two Sherbrooke men.
The detainees had to appear at the Palace of Justice in Sherbrooke following their arrest.
They could face charges of manufacturing Indian cannabis, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft, among others.
These inspections were carried out following a long investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was information we received from the public that enabled us to make these arrests", Mr Ruel said.
This police operation involved 70 officers from the Estrie Regional Investigative Unit of the Quebec State Police, the Sherbrooke State Police and the Sherbrooke Memphremagog Police Department.
The illegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
The Conservative bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will obviously be defeated, while all three opposition parties said Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely to a considerable extent on the Charter".
"I stand firm on the side of the party that built the jelly under your feet", Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff declared, surrounded by MPs after a week-long weekly du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the bill, as it is proposed, a law that would allow anyone to be detained for up to one year on a ship identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Bloc de Québec, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was going to the wrong end.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we'll see what the government does", Mr Duceppe said.
NPD critic on the issue of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected critics who want her party to be weak enough on illegal immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree that we take measures against smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we consider to be the core of another bill, C-35", Ms Chow said.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it blames refugees and incarcerates children for at least one year", Ms. Chow explained.
Immigration Secretary Jason Kenney has blamed the opposition.
"Canadians are telling MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada for granted and treat it like a pathogen".
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Minister Kenney responded.
The government did not vote to trust its bill, which could lead to elections leading to its rejection.
A Conservative told QMI that the government would demand a vote so that every MP who opposes it would be accountable to his constituents.
New Unity Does Not Mean unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possibility of setting up a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry committee on the issue.
Public Safety Minister Robert Dutil is trying to keep this idea in mind: Quebec intends to consult the New York Department of Investigation on the issue as early as January next year.
The Metropolitan has had a permanent anti-corruption unit at its disposal since 1870.
That's why Tuesday's announcement surprised one of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed, even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, public safety critic PQ Party member Stéphane Bergeron did not need to rate this announcement as "a rabbit out of a hat" and "an amateur solution messed up on his knees".
Minister Dutil himself has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"They're happy with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it".
"We are aware of this problem".
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the fact that we're holding a public hearing.
"In addition, Mr. Charest is determined not to create this commission of inquiry, and people, like you and I, think he's hiding something", he explains.
"The only way to get an investigation commission is to dismiss Jean Charest", explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of Higher Public Officials.
To get out of this dead end, he proposed that Quebec give a special mandate to the Inspector General to investigate collisions and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the inspector general", he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners who are allowed to force people to testify.
The establishment of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the Charest government's files.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Penal Code to better accommodate this type of crime.
This request would be made by the authorising officer for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law for this type of investigation was not explicit.
Federal Public Safety Secretary Vic Toews confirmed that his colleague in the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently working on some of the amendments to this file.
In the Spring 2001 operation that affected biker groups, although the penal code had not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently enacted changes to the Gangster Act.
Rivers under strict surveillance.
Several flows have been placed under strict control due to heavy rainfall that has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses have been evacuated.
There was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière, in the evening.
The road is broken.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy rainfall, ranging from 40 to 70 millimeters.
Another 20 to 40 millimeters were not expected between today and Thursday night, depending on the region.
The northern parts of the river and the Outaouais Valley were the hardest hit.
It could drop as much as 100 millimeters.
If we add these precipitation to the melting snow accumulated in some sectors, we may fear flooding in some watercourses.
Quebec Rescue Service issued a flood warning on Wednesday night for the Ouareau and Achigan Rivers in Lanaudière.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in les Laurentides, and in Chène, in Lotbinière, have been subject to flood alert and continuous control.
In the de Lanaudière area, heavy rainfall has caused the drainage of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was cut down by heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated.
In Outaouais, the spill of some lakes from the shores has caused some roads to close, particularly in Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The emergency services are on standby and monitoring the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecast Centre issued a severe flood warning on Wednesday for several rivers, notably the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Standards Board (RRTV) over controversial statements about welfare and Haitians and also because of his gross remarks during broadcasting.
The Broadcasting Board considers that Mr Dupont and his group from CHOI 98.1 FM were entitled to express their views, but some statements contained 'incorrect information on welfare and inappropriate negative descriptions of Haitian gross statements that do not correspond to broadcast during the day'.
The Council also concluded that discussions on suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of the two people who took their lives, did not violate the rules of broadcasting.
The Broadcasting Board has received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was taken following a complaint by the Quebec Social Support Front.
The group complained that the amounts shown in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not misleading.
As for suicide, moderator Stephane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the message was that suicide could not be understood as a solution to everyday life problems.
'The majority of the Commission considers that the controversial episodes of the DuPont Mid-Autumn Reports have exposed a sensitive subject in an impartial and appropriate manner.'
No charges have been filed against him.
The last dispute was about the statement made after the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were involved in a media shooting that sparked a lot of reaction.
The CHOI moderator said he didn't send any donations to help Haitians because we can't know for sure that the people in need will actually get the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified but that their cumulative effect creates an inappropriately negative image of Haitians.
"I've already settled my three-day delay on that thing".
"My file has been intact for a year and a half", the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use rude language in broadcasting.
In any event, CHOI-FM's broadcasting was cooperating 'beyond its obligations'.
For a station which will have to notify this decision once during the three-day main broadcast period, inter alia, the consequences are minimal.
King of the kung fu of Montreal.
The Montreal native, originally from Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely strange age.
An athlete who excels in the sand (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing enters the world's top and rings and seeks new challenges.
"I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria", explained Zemmal, who has lived in the capital since 2008, to learn from professionals.
"In my case, I look for matches pretty much everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground that comes with martial arts, competitions in North America are rare".
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and a UPS helper, just brought bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories", he said.
"I'm currently preparing for the World Cup in China in san-shou".
"The contestants who finished in the top four at the last World Championships in each category were invited".
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009".
"In 2005 I finished eighth in Vietnam".
"In 2007, in China, I finished fifth in the tournament, while in Toronto in 2009, I finished third", he added.
"Interestingly, I've made some progress in every competition".
"I'll be the first one this year or over!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where fist and foot strikes, as well as throwing to the ground, are allowed.
Matches are traditionally played on the court and less often in the ring.
The most famous boxer of this form of fighting is the Vietnamese-American Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
As much as Nacer Zemmal has only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the King of Sanda Super Tournament, the Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China", explains the nice guy.
"It's kind of the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium".
"It was a great experience.
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-final of his 80 kg category, before suffering a loss in the final.
"The guy who beat me was a real pro, analyzing".
"There are four competitors in the category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)".
"The semifinal winners will compete in the final of their respective categories".
"Then the winners of each category will compete to crown the only champion, the king of kung fu".
450 million won without public competition
Hydro-Québec agreed, following a mutual agreement, to 450 million in contracts with engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is the consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which won the most important contract, the overall project management contract worth $295 million without public competition.
This consortium, Énergie gérance, was authorised in 2004 in conjunction with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with the responsibility of managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Gerence consortium was awarded a lucrative contract without any public tender.
For the Quebec side, a complaint against a consortium of companies poses a serious ethical problem that risks excluding competition and driving up prices.
"It's a new way to make the collision happen and eliminate the competition".
"This means that people no longer make side agreements in secret, they are now making them openly", PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at a press conference yesterday.
A little earlier this morning, Mr. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he says it's hard to imagine how the public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, this afternoon, has been adamantly denying that this contract is about collagen.
"I have my own way", she groaned, claiming that PQ was "dishonest" and "lost accuracy".
She said "that would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for a consortium is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more undertakings to pool their mutual expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex in terms of the workload.
The construction is already underway and must be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competition; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of the engineering consulting consortium is the subject of a government investigation.
If we fly through the Quebec company registers quickly, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be created.
Dessau thus operates in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
As regards the Énergie Gérrance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed in particular that 'the Baie James area is characterised by a particular labour force dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s'.
The main sponsor of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), has given an explanation that will force us to put a stop to the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to a public competition and there are few bidders, your bids may be higher".
"You have two choices: you take the people who are in the contract as contestants and you say, 'Let's make a deal at a satisfactory price.'
"But the main point is that it is not the price that matters, but the competence of the people", Mr Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the Énergie Gérrance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir counted 109 contracts for engineering consultancy concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their subsidiaries, in particular laboratories performing soil sample analyses.
SNC-Lavalin has amassed 22 contracts, of which Génivar has won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without having a stake in "Energie Gérans".
All contracts have been concluded.
The total amount is $449,783,344, including a contract with Energy Gerence for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau reported that PQ was also associated with the companies that 'funded' it before clarifying that it was more of its managers.
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) No 1310/2013.
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in 'neutral' brands and environmental certificates to follow in their product selection.
The worst part is that even as we buy into a media universe that urges us to consume more socially responsible, it blames the media universe for a lack of credible information, a failure to meet obligations that it qualifies as even a brake on its commitment, says the responsible consumption barometer, whose first article was published yesterday.
Although the consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, Quebecers who try to sell them still don't trust them too much.
Two-thirds of us actually say they don't believe in the environmental promises of companies, simply because the green advertising by companies is finding a measuring instrument developed by the University of Sherbrooke's Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Other findings: Half of consumers question the credibility of official certificates issued on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are labelled as eco-friendly, Barometer reports.
Similarly, the debate by politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption appears to be a priority for stimulating this side of consumption, which is currently being revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the questionable nature of the information would ease the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake Barometer identified after the higher price of these products.
Moreover, a third of Quebecers are distrustful of the data on the products or "green" services we seek to get our hands on.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and in particular change the brand of one or more products in order to respond to their beliefs.
A total of 61% of them preferred shopping with local merchants and preferred to buy food grown in their region, reports Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the responsible consumption index reached 64 out of 100 for this year - Homo consumus Québec is happy to present itself as the king of recycling, striving to minimize environmental impact by protecting animals.
But their social and environmental conscience has obviously remained outside their car, says Baromètre: In 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers said they use public transportation or that they recommend using a car to drive at least two people, in the interests of protecting nature.
Walking and cycling also supported 39.1% of participants in this large-scale behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan to buy the eXcentris cinema complex
The Quebec government, which we have asked for a financial contribution to the purchase of the eXcentris cinemas by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only to the extent of the loan.
The development company Angus et le Parallèle, which sought a $7 million gift from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent and which proved its mission as a film lover, did not get what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan of a lower amount, which was an initial expectation that could lay the foundation for a viable solution on favourable terms and with state resources.
The first action plan and the 12.8 million request were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have already been revised to reduce.
The proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Culture Entrepreneurship (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the eXcentris film project.
The final report was sent 10 days ago.
But the government's counterproposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until 31 December to reply.
However, it seems that the state gift hypothesis must be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinéma Owners and Cinémas de Québec opposed direct state investment to support the purchase of eXcentris, believing that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project if he did not do so for other cinemas.
However, several participants in the discussion requested substantial financial support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his movie theater space during a decade of filmmaking after he financed the construction of the complex himself, which could have been a reason for the change by the state's finance board.
The shortage of independent movie theaters is rampant in Montreal, and eXcentris has managed to gain a steady clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, is running a campaign to free up private sector funding, believing it will raise $700,000 to fund the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, the only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen all three theaters on February 27th next year and show the most beautiful Xavier Beauvois movie Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't mention Le Devoir and he ignored it, thinking with his group about the reduction proposals that were made to him.
The curtain raises on Canada as a whole...
New American diplomatic sources brought to the attention of WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers a complex inferiority of Canadians to Americans, but with the same blow they express their sense of superiority over the last-named ones to Canada.
American diplomats are therefore amazed that every Canadian voter has a Canadian-American relationship at the heart of his vote, and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government to pass its 2009 budget!
Four new reports, including the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, D.C., released yesterday to the public, provide sensitive details to get under each other's skin.
The communication of 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the bets discussed by political leaders.
To the great admiration of the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
"Canada's near-fatal complex of minorities condition possible political leaders to talk about internal betting, rather than realizing that these elections also affect the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)", he writes.
"The United States is thus", he concluded, "the elephant in the room in these elections: ubiquitous but potentially too dangerous to be mentioned".
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" less than the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, party or even better party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls".
Another expression of this sense of importance can be found in a report sent on January 22, 2009, by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure that the government is preserved in the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, which is Canada's first publicly recognized deficit in more than a decade for a $30 billion to $40 billion recovery plan", Breese writes.
There is no mention that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session in the morning to avoid being defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties condition their survival on the quality of the proposed restoration plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, highlights Washington's increasingly negative image of the United States as a result of the dramatic series airing on CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcasts of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which contain not too clever references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA's abductions for the purpose of violent interrogation.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to take in some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed over a paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent, to the secretary of state".
"The secretary has agreed to revise the file".
Let's note, finally, that the people who are affected by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, told CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed".
It went viral, and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
The World Plan for the Restoration of Lighting
The UN yesterday proposed a plan in Cancun to restore domestic lighting, lighting of commercial and industrial premises in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse effect (GHE) limitation, which is almost one third of the additional limitation to be achieved to stabilize the planet's climate from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to implement in Cancun to compensate for the lack of difficult-to-realize reduction commitments on the part of industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the bulbs that are lit, which still hold 50 to 70% of the market, were to be replaced by fluorocompact or, even better, LED bulbs, the substantial amount of 1.8 billion tonnes of GES emissions from lighting on the planet would be cut off.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That's equivalent to 70% of the emissions from fleet cars on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, major countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, joined voluntary reduction plans to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will take another 5 Gt off this balance to achieve a 2°C stabilisation of climate warming by 2020 so that it can be ruled out getting out of control.
In light bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated as heat and the remaining 5% is the product of light.
With fluorocompact bulbs, we're cutting energy consumption by 75%, and with new LED bulbs, we're cutting energy consumption by another two times.
Fluocompact bulbs will last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, the ones Philips introduced this week - which reportedly participated in a UN study - have an expected lifetime of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than a light bulb, giving us an idea of possible savings with a replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
All of these new bulbs can also work with reostates and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluorocompact bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries,unless producers set up collectors.
However, the report notes that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluorocompact light bulbs but rather thermal coal-fired power plants, which emit much of the mercury needed to generate the electricity wasted in the light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants produce 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report also details the gains each country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year on electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 billion heating plants.
Ivory Coast is eagerly awaiting the results of the election.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election to be published immediately after the deadline.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to announce preliminary results without delay", the UN President's spokesman stressed.
'Calls on all parties and institutions in Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced.'
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission kept the deadline - Wednesday midnight - until three days after Sunday's vote.
About 40 minutes before the deadline expired, the President of CEI confirmed on television that the Commission was "continuing its work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls were mounting around the world for the CEI to finally announce the winner of the second round, between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassan Ouattar.
But Camp Gbagbo is counting on the Constitutional Council for "fraudulent" voting in the north, which has been run by former New Army (NAR) insurgents since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the campaign manager for the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, confirmed that the voter intimidation maneuvers of the FN (New Army) in the north of the country discouraged supporters of the Ivory Coast president from voting.
The election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council takes into account the complaint filed by Gbagbo.
However, President Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection to former rebels, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the results because he knows he suffered a loss and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after he prevented the Election Commission from broadcasting the results.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was seen as the crowning of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two halves for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivory Coast political faction on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished first in the first round on 31 October, winning 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who won public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment in France remains stable in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, as defined by the International Labour Office (ILO), has remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as shown by provisional seasonal deviation adjustment (CVS) data published by INSEE on Thursday.
The unemployment rate has been set at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed for 9,3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9,7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
In a larger picture, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France are not working in the third quarter, but they would like to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and whether or not they are looking for work.
The current labour market situation of young people has been further exacerbated by a new increase in unemployment, reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% in overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, there were 637,000 unemployed young people aged 15 to 24.
As regards seniors, they saw a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6,4% in metropolitan France (+0,2 points in three months, as in one year), i.e. 482 000 people over 50 and 6,6% including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 benefited from the unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points for three months, +0.1 points for one year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
Insee has not published a monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to produce monthly statistics, and on Tuesday reported a rate of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and put in custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of waste treatment companies and a brother of the PS of the Bouches-du-Rhône Board of Directors, was charged and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public procurement allegedly obtained underground.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with misusing the company's assets, misusing public funds and public property, concealing, providing bribes, accepting bribes to influence the authorities and holding ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is a fighter and insists that the judge explain all the questions he intends to ask him, not any delusions".
"It's easy to prosecute him for many punishable reasons, but it's another thing to prove them", his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before questioning her client.
Mr. Guérini stated through his lawyers that he had sent the judge a brief message before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his closest friends, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but run the landfill he was supposed to manage.
As regards the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds linked to their operation, Mr Simon said he had never known anything like this.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of Aubagne's services, was charged on Wednesday with misuse of public funds and conspiracy, and was released under a court order to prevent contact with the protagonists of the whole affair.
"My client was able to provide an explanation for all the facts that were alleged to him".
"The investigating judge will look into it and let him go", his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux, said.
Four other people were charged and released on Tuesday night, Wednesday, with two of them under judicial supervision, said Attorney General's Deputy Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General with elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes to influence the administration and for passive corruption.'
Two Aubagne city officials, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "expropriation and misuse of the company's assets", the other for "conspiracy to misuse public funds".
Finally, Alexandra Guérini's business partner, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "hidden exploitation of the company's assets".
Among those confronted by Mr Guerin is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company helped launder money from a large-scale gangster operation.
The investigation is being carried out in the context of several open court investigations against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the award of public procurement, in particular in the waste field.
From a source of close investigation, the search is focused in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some towns in the Marseille Metropolitan Municipality (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: The Elysian Palace has overstepped Syria's mediation
Over a period of more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the role of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", united views in France, put diplomacy on the alert and stressed the relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this is being closely monitored by diplomats from the United States.
American documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such cases of hostages in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how senior French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not a compensation for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France sought by US justice for underground trafficking in material in favor of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they are putting a sharp spotlight on the way the French presidency has tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
He didn't actually do anything about it.
The diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled: "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostages".
The Elysee Palace strategic affairs adviser, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is speaking with the US diplomatic representative, Allegrone.
They're explaining the French method to him.
They recommend Americans do the same to bring back their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make a noise", they say, "continuously speak out loud" in the media the words "basic human rights", "innocence", "immediate liberation".
We need to bring the Iranian regime into trouble, sensitive to its image.
"Do it the more they ask you to stop".
Because negotiations have been attempted through discrete channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "the masterminds of avoidable maneuvers".
Mr. Richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners is "an Iranian family tactic: hostage-taking for the purpose of "political blackmail".
It states that the release of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, the day she is granted asylum by the French Embassy) 'will require a high financial sum to be paid to the Iranians' (€230,000 bail).
And he announces that the Elysian Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that will "increase".
The Iranian authorities "may arrest about 1,800 more French citizens living in Iran in the future", it says.
the date of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article;
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but she's still locked up in Iran.
Information circulates: Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States claims was deported for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material in relation to Iran, is being released on bail in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
The American Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing consensus.
For Washington, which is pursuing illegal Iranian networks to obtain material intended for its nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France has agreed to the treaty?
Liberating an Iranian for liberating a young French woman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The palace of Elisha, he says, was not only "surprised by the judge's decision" but was looking for a way to oppose it.
"There were talks between the presidential office and the justice minister" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision", he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" surveillance by the French intelligence service.
The Elysee Palace adviser extracts a phone number, hangs up a phone ring, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the buildings in Paris run by the Iranian embassy".
At the time of Clotilde Reiss's imprisonment in Iran, the Elysee Palace is working, through a communiqué and organized "escape" media to convince Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad that he plays a "significant" and "influential" role as a "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and they note that manipulation is paying off, as several articles in the press reflect the official French version.
The Telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes a media 'blast' by French officials.'
What is the basis of this "gratitude" expressed towards Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
"Despite their eloquent statements, French officials privately admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did".
The documentary then deals with the reasons that led the Elysian Palace to pay for this fiction.
The intensive communication "is aimed at validating President Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he analyzes.
The policy implemented in 2008 'was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and unwarranted'.
By "exaggerating Syria's role", Paris is trying to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can earn by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow a grain of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is".
"But we thanked them anyway".
"That should at least create confusion and ambiguity among Iranians".
Klotilda Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy is receiving her at the Elysian Palace.
In the communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our country".
The end of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government is passing a law called "Percivalsky" that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, officials said.
The bill will be introduced in Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to the games after midnight for people under 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family Affairs said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have learning difficulties at school and are unable to lead normal lives during the day".
"We believe this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep", Jo Rin, the head of the ministry responsible for the draft law, told AFP.
Online games will be available from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for enforcement, he specified.
The government also expects to ask companies to limit the daily time for access to these games for young people whose parents so request, the official added.
It also makes free programs available to people who request it, allowing them to limit their time on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "affected" countries, and the daily press regularly reports various facts about the heavy use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed world champion in online gaming.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, in front of 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA establishes the host countries.
A full riot over allegations of corruption is being established by FIFA's Executive Committee on Thursday in the host country of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a sovereignly politically motivated selection where influence fighting and lobbying risk exceeding technical criteria.
The 2018 FIFA World Cup will be held in Europe, the traditional backbone of the sport (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to capture new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to deploy to the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons participating in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an idea of the scale of economic and political betting around the world.
The negotiations behind the scenes risk going on until the last minute.
It's hard for the rest of us to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, the UK, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and US (2022) documentation contain the best arguments, as do the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not be too weighty for the 22 members of the Executive Board to vote in the hour.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of the revelation that led to the suspension of two members of the EC/European Commission for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu) may have thus destroyed the chances of their country, a country that has so far only hosted the World Cup once a year.
The BBC was crowned that Monday when it aired a documentary that "stuck three influential members of the European Commission", Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make FIFA unhappy and get the British executive in trouble with David Cameron in the front row.
The Prime Minister hopes to repeat the move his predecessor Tony Blair made in 2005, who won the 2012 London Olympics.
Will this intense activity be enough to give England a new sparkle to its name at the CE?
Nothing is less certain because the Spanish-Portuguese duo are not lacking in the trophies of the already-prepared stadiums, their charity (the 1982 World Cup in Spain, the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the clouded economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
The possible retaliatory measures against the English and the doubts about the eligibility of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move the championship to Zurich and publicly declared "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a wording barely twisted at the accusations of the English press against members of the CE (European Commission).
"We're going to throw mud at them, try to compromise them", Mr Putin declared.
For 2022, the United States seems to be the logical favorite with its substantial experience from 1994.
The world's top economy, home to the world's biggest FIFA sponsors, seems to have a big lead over Japan and South Korea, who have separately built a beautiful project.
But these candidates seem premature for the two countries, which together passed the "trial" in 2002.
Another threat: awarding the 2026 World Cup to China, which is so eagerly awaiting FIFA, has made Asian chances for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar pulling out a big axis in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue to expand into new landscapes, but these two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could be charged a heavy TV fee (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, which is a driving force for FIFA.
The second mandate: clarity (certainty)
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand made it seem like he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they are.
The mandate of the Elysian Palace calls someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious doesn't quite fit with the secrecy part of the presidency.
So you have to act as if the doubts persist.
In one sense or another.
In 2006, unbelievably, friends of Jacques Chirac made demands that a third term not be ruled out.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy made a serious statement saying that "it will be decided sometime in the fall of 2011".
As he recalled to the members of the UMP Parliament on Wednesday evening at the Elysee Palace, the prospect of a "two-term" was not a feverish one.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 amendment to the Constitution limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was just a statement from him, not a statement.
It's not the first time he's used a humorous tone of presidential election in meetings like this.
"At worst, or at best, you have seven and a half more years with me", he concluded in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage".
His remarks the day before won't make him a candidate any more than the day before; they won't make him a candidate any less.
If they're making comments, it's because of the double truth.
Accelerating the path to the candidate for the PS, side one.
But it's not the entrance to the Ségolène Royale bakery that's pressuring Nicolas Sarkozy to be convicted.
On the contrary, because of his candidacy in 2012, it is obvious that many in the PS want a more premature than intended order to combat.
Bad scouting on the other side.
First, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of Francois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing this with the UMP", responded immediately and cautiously the people from the Prime Minister's immediate vicinity.
"If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe he can win", corrects Alain Juppé, who is willing to accept the obvious.
Euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue its purchases of government bonds.
The last meeting of the Central Governors' Council in the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for recovery from the crisis or, at least, to announce the halt of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations to be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of sovereign European debt is bound, and the institution of securities issuers will certainly not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation already tense on European securities markets.
The political price would be much higher in that case.
At a press conference yesterday, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, paid tribute to the active role played by the European Central Bank in solving the debt crisis of European countries.
She didn't want to say if she thought the bank could do more, like by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
'I express my condolences to my European partners . . .'
The night before, in Brussels, during his interview with the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not express his intentions more explicitly, but welcomed the fact that the secondary market securities purchase programme was 'continuing' and that 'we will see how we decide' at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty is that the European Central Bank will maintain its basic fixed interest rate at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of treasury bonds by the European Central Bank doubled to almost EUR 1.35 billion in the last week.
And because of the unreasonable nature of the market deal, yesterday, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
The market agreement does not allow for any doubts on the continuation of the purchases (see page 29).
Even economists don't expect any major change in the course.
If the lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the European Central Bank's arsenal, the latter shall proceed to unlimited liquidity provision on generous terms and for a period of one week to three months.
Economists now expect this mechanism to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine her changing her program in any significant way".
"If not, it would mean taking the risk of creating a new short-term tension", says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
'The progressive outlook announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,' predicts Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
I'm not going to go to Oppenheim.
Norbert Bräms adds that the European Central Bank would have to maintain its bond purchases to revive a sluggish market.
Given the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, it has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It needs to compensate for the lack of investors in the market at all costs and act in a way that prevents the burst of paid performance by the most fragile states", a senior bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, states will be more anxious to reduce their debt rather than stabilize it.
It's saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is backing down.
After the beginning of the week, Italy's worrying situation relaxed slightly, with the bond interest rate backflowing to 10 years yesterday.
Return to temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economy, the regional leaders said they had heard Giulia Tremonti describe the situation as 'irreconcilable' and expect a 'unpredictable' weekend, which the participants then denied.
In any event, by way of derogation from the long German interest rates, on Tuesday the price of the CDS reached a record 210 basis points and rose to 263 points, causing some uproar in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the German interest rate deviation was above 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "too busy" with "the volatile market developments" and a possible infection originating in Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland".
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal", explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, the problem is the lack of growth and unprofitable fiscal inflows, which go hand in hand and put the state at risk of not being able to meet its funding needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italy is now expected to grow by 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will represent a further 4,3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3,9% projected by the government) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
Hence the reputation of a new sum of supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounting to 7 billion euros.
'If necessary, new stringent measures will have to be taken,' says Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The foundations of its economy are right and its calculations are correct, we have been saying that for a long time", assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund's Board of Governors under pressure from Italy to the IMF.
'There is no immediate problem, not short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilisation effort required in Italy is less than the efforts required from other countries,' notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Chief Economist.
The question remains of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be held, which are due at the end of March.
This would create a period of time which is not suitable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening their anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde stressed this again yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think Europeans demonstrated it on Sunday all day and night, they are obviously very committed to solidarity, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone".
Although all is relative, yesterday's record of expansion in interest rates on European government bonds has brought water to the mill for governments and the European Central Bank.
But we can't talk about the start of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's notation authority has announced that it could degrade the debt record of Portugal, a target that has been the focus of various speculations.
'Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and transparency in the banking system,' says Exane economist BNP Paribas.
More so that "political time is slower than market time".
Aware of this disrupted context and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most concerned by the issue and, more broadly, with their G20 counterparts are progressing very well.
This is in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin group starting at the beginning of next week.
The European Central Bank is meeting today.
The programme is designed to support non-conventional market-focused measures for euro area countries (see above).
On Tuesday, the European Finance Fund (EFSF) Executive Director Klaus Regling launched a trip to Asia in Singapore to inform investors from the Far East about the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of this journey is not to raise funds, it is indeed setting the stage for achieving this goal.
The first issue of the ESF securities is expected next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the United States would support any increase in mobilized funds by adding additional direct engagement to the IMF.
The countries concerned, Portugal and Spain, are preparing for structural reforms, particularly in terms of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are accompanied by rapidly effective, strict measures.
Lisbon and Madrid have a different route than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries are keen to avoid asking for international assistance at all costs before they implement their own budgetary adjustments and decide on the structural reforms necessary to regain lasting trust.
Finally, European fund investors are talking about the options available to accelerate the process of normalizing sovereign bond markets.
On his visit to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if the €750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to re-invent its stockpile.
Economists at Barclays Capital, which is involved in the very first European sovereign debt trading scheme, consider that an additional EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, 'preferably' in the form of a direct provision of financial liquidity.
The means exist: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which has been subsidised to date by €60 billion.
A council that has every chance of being tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions have been worsening.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have an orange emergency.
Snowfall is still causing traffic problems, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk that it will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties are now in an orange emergency due to the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne have joined the 20 districts already declared to be in an orange emergency, 18 as of Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowstorms are causing problems in the north of La Gironde and Les Charentes and slight snowfall in Ile-de-France.
A snow cover of 2 to 5 cm, places of 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the districts concerned and a cover of 1 to 3 cm, places of 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
Snowstorms are large enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt some economic activities, predicts Météo France.
On the Côtes d'Armor coast, some districts have banned heavy goods traffic - trucks over 7.5 tonnes on the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac routes.
Traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, police say, and police recommend that you only drive when it is really necessary and some trucks have been cancelled for the day.
School holidays were banned in Picardy on Thursday.
No special measures are envisaged to restrict freight transport on Wednesday evening.
The district authority "calls on all motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt the driving character of the road".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris Roissy Airport and 10% at Orly on Thursday due to expected snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services contact their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate over the modernization of transport in the Ile-de-France has been in full swing, billions have fallen.
At least during the discussion.
We are particularly reminded of the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to enable this construction to start, the State has announced a grant of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, this is an amount that will then allow SGP to use part of its dual source funding for the contracts.
Today we finally get to the first amendments.
The Finance Amendment Act of 2010, which is being examined by the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms set out to secure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special tax on equipment and the increase in the tax on offices in the Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, Article 15, is "in favour of the public institution of the Société du Grand Paris".
It reads: "The profit from this interest is 117 million euros per year".
The second is the restructuring of the rate for the existing office 'to be modernised in order to increase the revenue generated and to affect the Société du Grand Paris'.
How much would it cost?
It's a delusion.
It's not numbered in the text.
We're four billion miles away.
'It is specified that these fiscal resources will be added to the EUR 4 billion of capital assistance to be mobilised by the State and invested in the Société du Grand Paris under the project', the explanatory statement reads.
We at SGP don't find this system shocking.
"From the moment we generate revenue, we can cover the study for three years and then dig up to 4 billion", it explains here.
"It will be included in the budget and used as needed".
SGP expects to allocate 4 billion in the 2014 budget only in 2013.
This mechanism, which holds the promised 4 billion to absent subscribers, risks provoking a somewhat heated parliamentary debate.
The first public hearing will be on December 7.
The hacks and the scouts
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, there is a clear scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and predicts a future of regress controlled.
But let's get it right.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the fact that every document compiled by a secret service (any nation) is made up entirely of press clippings.
The "extraordinary revelations" of Americans about Berlusconi's sexual lifestyle tell them what anyone could read in any newspaper for months (all but these two Berlusconi owned), and Gaddafi's infamous caricature profile has long been a subject of sketches for cabaret artists.
The rule that secret documents should consist only of messages already known is fundamental to the dynamics of the secret service, and not just this century.
If you go to a bookstore devoted to esoteric literature, you'll find that every work (about the Grail, the Rennes-le-Château mystery, the Templars or the Woodmen) repeats exactly what was already written in previous works.
Not only does the author of occult texts hate to look for new information (or not know where to look for information about nonexistent ones), but those who practice the occult only believe what they already know and confirm what they have learned.
That's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same goes for classified documents.
The informant is a lazy, lazy (or limited in spirit) head of the secret service (and if he isn't, he could be, as far as I know, the editor of the Libération newspaper), who only believes what he confesses to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy sent to the state department was the same as the one that Newsweek had published a week earlier.
So why was there so much talk about these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person knows, that since the end of World War II, at least, and since heads of state can make phone calls or fly out to dinner together, embassies have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representative exercises, have been transformed into a spy centre.
Any viewer of investigative films knows very well that it is only out of hypocrisy that it is seemingly ignored.
However, the fact that it is repeated publicly dishonors the duty of hypocrisy and throws a bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker could gain access to the most highly classified information of the world's most powerful country is a hard blow, not a negligible blow, to the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and their "executives".
But let's get to the truth about what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell's time, it was possible to conceive of all power as some Big Brother controlling every movement of his people.
Orwell's prophecy has been proven since the ability to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, every hotel visited, every highway used, and so on, made a citizen a complete victim of the crown of power.
But when we demonstrate how things are now, that even "grave tombs" with the most secret information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of some hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a circuit.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker -- elected as a citizen's avenger -- can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power be maintained that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a true secret is a bottomless secret (and bottomless secrets can never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a topless secret because it is taken out of public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secret was bottomless secrets is to deprive him of all power.
WikiLeaks didn't make any mistakes with Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did something big for Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this wound of power be so significant?
Clearly, in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online - the same as posting it on a street corner poster.
But it's also quite obvious that with current technology, there's no reason to hope that you can keep a phone message secret.
There's nothing easier than knowing if and when the head of state flew in and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and sensitive messages be kept secret in the future ?
I know my predictions are science fiction at this point, and so they're fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials who are discreetly carrying out formalities on uncontrollable routes and carrying only the messages they know by heart or rather hide the rare information in their shoes.
The information will be stored in unique copies in key-locked drawers: overall, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways forward, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has rehabilitated the telegraph based on wires.
Video cassettes (analog) allowed movie lovers to shoot the film step by step, moving it back and forth and revealing all the secrets of the setup, while now CDs (number) only allow you to skip through the chapters, i.e. through the macroporters.
We can get from Rome to Milan by express train in three hours, while the plane and transportation that it takes takes us three and a half hours.
It is no wonder that politics and communication technology are returning to horse-drawn carriages.
One last note.
On other occasions, the press tried to understand what was going on in the embassy's secret.
Now it's the embassies asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its pledges of funding
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to test the promise of rapid unblocked financing (or early-start financing) implemented by developed countries.
And the great French hooks were revealed
In the Copenhagen Accord, the developed countries committed to providing $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million a year).
At the start of COP16, the EU has taken a big step to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: a report clarifying its Member States' actions, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
A transparent operation invaluable and valued for its true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to deliver on its pledge of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we look at the details, we find things are much more complicated.
The Commission therefore considers that the aid is compatible with the internal market and that the aid is compatible with the internal market.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
The European Commission, for example, considered 2009 as a reference year: international funding was preserved and it is adding 150 million to it for three years under the title of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or deadlines at the level of public development aid.
France, on the other hand, considers that the financing of 'all new projects' in 2010 is 'new and additional'.
In other words,there is no reference to the expenditure of the previous periods or to the global level of public aid for development.
In particular, the total amount of aid granted by France to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even reduced), in order to comply with its commitment to finance 'new and additional ...'.
Another crucial factor is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There's no rule yet, and everyone chooses their own way of calculating.
Some, like France, consider that a loan is equal to a donation.
Obviously, it's hard to prove: effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects linked to emission reductions based on more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro we receive as the equivalent of one euro we give... we should not understand it from the title of our commitments but as the price of the loan for the creditor country (i.e. the interest rate equivalent).
But France can only give this justification: it 'complies' with its €420 million commitment, making 91.5% of it loans (€389.8 million) and 8.5% donations (€36.1 million) - see the EU document for your own sake.
It is the only Union country to use the loan on such a scale.
Germany requested 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) comply with their 100% contribution commitments.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union gives €1 per month to fulfil its promise, it will give France only 10 cents and consider this an equivalent effort.
That's a beautiful piece of cabbage!
In summary, in its 'fast start' financing, France operates with a double-edged approach: on the one hand, with the development of the stock over time and on the other hand, with a real financial burden.
Although he spends only 36.1 million euros, he can convince himself that he is spending 420 million euros "new and additional" in keeping with his promises.
The manipulation of the finance minister (because it seems that Bercy made the decision) could have a double negative impact both within the EU (why would member states continue to give when all they need to do is borrow?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter on early financing is only a small question, relatively short term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be a grain of sand in a giant machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not our case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
France should first notify a change in its accounting practices for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and decency and justice towards the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid the discussion of long-term financing investments (another essential chapter currently being discussed): we cannot avoid the question of 'sufficiency' or how loans are accounted for.
France should change its position to become as progressive in these deposits as it is in others.
So everyone's hoping for the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Moritz, who will be arriving in Cancun next week.
The surprising announcement of France's fast start and its vision of 'compliance' and the use of loans could lead to an increase in international confidence necessary to advance the discussions.
Alert about pesticides that children are watching.
A 10-year-old child will one day look at 81 different chemicals, according to a study published Wednesday, from the Future Generations Association (formerly the Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which notes that its results "have no significant statistical value given the low number of samples analysed but are characteristic of the processed issue", purchased between July and September food commonly consumed in four meals and one light snack per child for about a decade in supermarkets in L'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including the official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - and sugar products, were analysed by the research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are carcinogenic, possible or probable, and five are among the clear carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that could act as a disruptor to the internal carotid gland (IP), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research we clearly see that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogens, and/or PE is staggering", the association states.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea contain about 10 residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven carcinogens, as well as about 20 residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, reported in a study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same is true for the Kenyan green beans included for lunch, where the study found traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, ground meat steaks, canned tuna, and even peas and chewing gum were contaminated with pesticides and other chemicals.
The analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform in the tap water.
The salmon steak for dinner was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered, and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat food in the microwave did not escape analysis.
The final risk to consumers of this 'contaminant cocktail' is likely to be underestimated,' the study shows.
The Ecological Europe-Green (EE-LV) has proposed a moratorium on pesticide use to halt the "growth of civilization diseases" "in the face of an emergency".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the residue status of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which were in cereals.
