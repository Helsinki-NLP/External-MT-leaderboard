The prime ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is making his first major foreign visit since his election victory in May, when he met Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day visit to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world's third largest economy.
Plans for greater nuclear cooperation are high on the agenda.
India is also reportedly hoping for a defence cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Karratha police arrested 20-year-old man after speeding motorcycle
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushlands to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic officers in Karratha this morning attempted to stop a blue motorcycle after observing it leaving a gas station on Bathdate Road at 75 miles an hour.
Police report that the driver then ignored the stop signs and continued on Burgess Road before veering into the bush where officers lost sight of him.
The motorcycle and a person matching the driver's description were later seen at a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police are charging a 20-year-old man with failing to obey a stop sign and reckless driving.
He is to appear in the Karratha District Court on 23 September.
The motorcycle was seized and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was arraigned at a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster assaulted her while she was "unconscious, asleep, and unable to signal consent".
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Highlands, Scotland, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial for 17 November at the High Court in Edinburgh.
The idea of the European Union is to be a model for the European Union, a model which is based on the principle of subsidiarity.
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced legislation to establish the organization of unions as a civil right.
"As unions die, so do middle-class jobs", said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and vice chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That's why I'm proud to join with civil rights icon John Lewis in introducing the Employee Empowerment Act.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal options for discrimination on the grounds of trade union organisation as for other forms of discrimination - and stops anti-union forces.
The amendment of the national labour law to provide a means for discriminated workers to organise a trade union representation, to sue for justice in a civil court - and to receive compensation or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that unions have faced in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and enforce labor rights.
There was a time, and millions of Americans remember it, when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assemble, all in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojo was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that the workers and their unions were playing a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers to unite and to negotiate and act together are guaranteed".
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers would have to organize and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to form associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or trade.
Agreements restricting or seeking to restrict this right are null and void; any measures aimed at such a restriction are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide convention in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions for the protection of his interests".
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When that country advised other countries on how to build civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a union -- and then to have that union participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with business and government agencies -- must be protected.
After these rights have come under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to recall the American ideal, which is that the working people must have the right to unite and make their voices heard in a free and open society.
As the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, labor has miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protection as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representation - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that made America great in the past and fulfilling the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops legislation that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily halted the implementation of a Louisiana law that lawyers say would have likely led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and set to take effect on Sept. 1, would force doctors who perform abortions to purchase a patient-receptionist license at any hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions temporarily while they seek such a right.
"The plaintiffs may continue to work lawfully while they pursue these rights", wrote federal judge John deGravelles in his ruling.
Within a month, a hearing is scheduled for the judge to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the ruling, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, saying it gives doctors more time to get used to obtaining hospital referral rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are escaping a devious law that seeks to take away their health and rights", said Nancy Northup, president and chair of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which has filed a lawsuit on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics that had not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for rights of referral.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have forced most of the state's remaining hospitals to close were halted by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association agree that doctors' rights to prescribe require unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion argue that the measures are to protect women's health, although some also welcome the effects of closing clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient-injury privileges, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would not perform the operation for fear of his safety, the group said.
In arguing against the ruling, Louisiana state officials said that they would not punish doctors for performing abortions while their patient-reporting claims were pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in urban areas.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of mortality was 20 percent higher during the study than for those in urban areas.
Small study: New drugs could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers studied the women's medical care for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman's age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing medical conditions, and social and economic status also affected the odds of survival.
Older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of death was 20 percent higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not look at why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggests that late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers may be factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and they are usually found in larger cities", she said.
Despite the improvement in telemedicine services to compensate for the distance, she suggested as a possible solution the reinforcement of the in-flight doctor service to enable specialists to provide care closer to women's homes, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr Jordan said the study found poor long-term survival rates for women with ovarian cancer regardless of geographical status, and highlighted the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old young mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers lament declining homeownership
The decline, coupled with a sharp drop in the number of homeowners under 35, could see garden centres lose tens of thousands of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach the "garden product age group", according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says that renters spend on average 55 percent of what people with homes spend on their gardens.
The rise in people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popular practice of paving front gardens for park purposes and the declining size of gardens are further factors threatening the industry, which is worth an estimated £5 billion in sales annually.
Greater London, where the proportion of home owners has fallen from 61 to 43 per cent over a six-year period, has the lowest expenditure on garden products per household.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that renting or small gardens do not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening consultant for the RHS, said: "Container gardening is popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them when they move".
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail due to rising homeownership rates and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also forecast an improved market situation for this year, due to the better weather after unfavourable weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1,000 demonstrators stormed the state-run PTV television station.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The station was off the air for about 40 minutes, but has since resumed broadcasting.
At the same time, around 3,000 protesters tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometer away, armed with sticks and stones, they clashed with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refused.
The country's army, meanwhile, urges a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and without resorting to violence".
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state".
The military plays a major role in Pakistan and has been involved in more coups.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in last May's parliamentary election.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to storm Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat to be detained over spying report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has summoned the country's most senior U.S. diplomat to discuss a report on U.S. and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the US Embassy's business manager and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that the revelations by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British intelligence.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the report's importance, saying that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that Germany's top intelligence service was also targeting Ankara caused a much more angry reaction from the Turkish government.
Warning: Train drivers threaten to have consequences for commuters
The nationwide strike of the train drivers on Monday evening could also affect the passenger traffic in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The 6 to 9 p.m. curfew affects all transport companies nationwide, including long-distance, regional and suburban railway services.
The main thrust of the warning strike is the goods traffic.

The German authorities have not yet decided whether to grant the aid.
We expect to see significant outages.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike was to transport goods.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything to minimise the impact.
The GDL did not say where it was going to strike, however, so it was difficult to predict the consequences.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
Prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police and employees of the city of Calvià to the Mallorca prosecutor's office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested following allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the notorious binge-drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro has been taken into custody by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located, after corruption allegations against him.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the Office of the Public Prosecutor for Anti-Corruption of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are being questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
Spanish national daily ABC reported that angry nightclub owners said the government's patronage had had a serious impact on their businesses.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival", one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihood out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer after a viral YouTube video showed an 18-year-old British tourist performing fellatio on 24 men during a drinking tour.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the disorderly behaviour of drunken holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the notorious drunken pub parties.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatiomom took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and Kneipentour organizer Carnage jointly paid a €55,000 ($73,000) fine.
The tourist resort of Magaluf, popular with young British holidaymakers in particular, is also known for a number of drunk driving accidents, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
FRÜHLING has brought a winter surprise to South Australia, with heavy showers and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening, until 9 pm, another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm that had already fallen in the night to Sunday.
The latest rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a cascade that began just before 8 p.m. and produced nearly 4mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After last week's winter brought an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell to a high of only 15.8°C on Monday.
Bad weather conditions likely caused a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide to be delayed.
The plane was scheduled to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a gust of wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to resume its flight.
Wind gusts reached about 30 miles per hour on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
Flight data showed that the plane had to restart on a second landing flight and finally took off at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay subsequently led to the delay of several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
Adelaide is forecast to hit a high of 16 degrees on Tuesday with the possibility of showers.
Matthies says it 's time to make a big move .
In the face of the rapid technological advances that threaten to transform our comfortable homes into high-tech switching centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies takes solace in a very familiar electronic accessory.
As I'm writing this, I'm looking at the spiral cable that connects the earpiece to the phone, and I'm thinking, "Wow, how retro is that?"
But there is a reasoning behind it: If it were not for the cable, all the headphones would be flying around the house in no time, and that would be much more retro.
The same applies to the electronic (e-electronic?
No, typo: electronic) sector the rule that the world's novelty of today is the electrical junk of tomorrow, bought - obsolete.
And if you still have a tube TV in your living room today, you are simply saying that you are against television in principle.
Why are you thinking this?
Because the IFA's insistence on the radio tower this week again highlights our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics.
The lazy man who once blindly mastered the washing machine and the CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread before him with incredibly vain expertise: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies", promises the press office.
Yeah, you still got it?
What do you talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such quark?
The main issue for the last 20 years has been to get our homes properly connected.
So the yogurt can order in, so the fire lookout can tell us when we're on vacation in the Maldives that the office is on fire.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we could get out of the office and get the air conditioning on our short arrival...
Yeah, but that's gonna require an air conditioning unit.
But a dream is sure to come true soon: We lift our wristwatch, say "suck!" - and the vacuum robot starts at home.
You're wrong.
The result is nothing less than a revolution: "The lines between white and brown goods are blurred", says an industry insider, "the washing machine can be connected to a headset, the steam generator can send the weather report and the data glasses can tell us how long the pizza will take to bake, but that's no good, because we're stuck in traffic.
We also know from daily experience that when a new device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to run out.
Which is another reason why the coil wire on the phone will survive the next radio exhibition.
Israeli children return to their schools after the Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air-raid shelters as rocket and mortar fire fell on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools in Gaza remained closed as the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and anticipation to the communities in southern Israel that have been hit by rockets, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff at the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a missile, removed shrapnel from the walls and slide walls before the students arrived.
"We are a little scared, but excited", said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many of the children in our area are desperate to get back to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a little weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't go out at all", she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire ended the war last week, thousands of residents of the border communities like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas farther away from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children have been placed in other schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza that has been hit hard by Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security".
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to an indefinite ceasefire.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas's demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and seaports.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the handover of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin this month in Egypt.
The war has killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and UN estimates.
Israel denies this and estimates that at least half of those killed were fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence to support this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortars during the fighting at Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip, and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
As tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and fighting continues, education authorities last week postponed the start of the school year.
"I hope the school will reopen soon so that we can continue to learn, just like the children of the world and the Jewish children", said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
The European Union is also a party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
In view of the loss of votes for the NPD in Saxony, Thomas Strobl, the CDU vice-president, has called for an end to the ongoing NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
The German government has been trying to persuade the German people to accept the new law, which would allow the German people to vote for the new law.
"The NPD is performing worse than last time", Strobl, who is also the CDU leader in Baden-Württemberg, told the Leipziger Volkszeitung.
This is a welcome development in the right direction and one that leads me to conclude that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had narrowly failed to pass the five-percent threshold in Sunday's vote.
A first attempt to ban the extreme right-wing party failed in 2003 because the protection of the Constitution had informants in the NPD's top.
In December 2013, after a long period of preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for newly arrived refugees
Refugees are now being housed in tents at Neulanderplatz.
The Central Refugee Reception Centre in Harburg is bursting at the seams.
Now the Home Office has three tents of the Red Cross set up next to it.
The district politicians were informed just a short time before - they are not very enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions further fuel citizens' reservations and do not give the district politicians the opportunity to participate constructively in the humanitarian accommodation of refugees", says Britta Herrmann, the leader of the Green Party in the district assembly of Harburg.
Your party demands that the district administration of Harburg make available currently unused houses for accommodation.
The three tents can accommodate 96 refugees.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the first intake are the influx of people seeking help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the normal three months.
House prices have seen the strongest winter rise in seven years, according to a widely watched index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1% in August, according to RP data from Monday.
This increase brings the overall increase in June, July and August to 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data's head of research, Tim Lawless, said that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-tiered market.
Figures from RP Data show that Sydney's house prices rose 16.1 percent last year, while Melbourne's rose 11.7 percent.
The next markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six per cent respectively.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices have risen by only 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr Lawless added that with the beginning of spring, there would be an increase in the number of properties for sale in the coming months, putting the market "to a real test".
"Given the continuing high rate of auction prices, a generally rapid rate of sales and the continuing low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise over the next three months", he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts the statements of the managing director Peer Medau and attests to him posing "like a general".
The university's style is not this, the statement said.
The Medau family had already been informed of the university's plans by word of mouth in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July is definitely false", said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not 'predetermined or even decisions', but 'preferences'.
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle, which was necessary for access, was also less dramatic than the Medes feared.
There was and is no talk of a 30-foot-wide road.
It is 5.50 metres wide at the present level, which is one metre wider than before", explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking areas will in future only be used by university students is not accepted by Pötzl.
There is no train parking at all, because, as with other public parking spaces, it can now be solved intelligently.
Thinking of the locals
The children's nursery Bergwichtel, which is located on the site and whose front door would lead to the entrance to the park deck, should "not be affected", according to the university president.
He said that "this is not just about the nursery school, but also about the inhabitants of the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring school.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the new regulation to the areas of the environment, transport and energy.
Whether the criticism of the parents' council of the crèche that the road would be one of "the few natural spots of Coburg to be lost" is justified, "can the reader decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl will inform the city councils together with the Bamberg State Building Office about the construction development of the university until 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau informed the parents of the crèche about the plans of the university last week.
The new parking deck will not be accessed via the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straße, as is the case now, but via the Medau-Berg.
This would require the narrow road to be widened to two lanes, about a kilometer long.
According to the Medous' calculations, this would increase traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle tenfold.
It is estimated that about 2000 vehicles a day are involved.
The city has not yet commented on the project.
Glandorf resigns from national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga player SG Flensburg-Handewitt cited health problems as the main reason for this decision.
It was not an easy decision, but it took months to mature.
It's time for me to listen to my body and end my career in the national team", the 2007 World Champion said on his Facebook page.
He thus retires with a record of 167 international matches and 576 goals for Germany.
The powerful back-row player wants to be a champion for Flensburg for a few more years, so he is no longer available to the new national coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
The Icelander, who will announce his squad for the international matches against Switzerland on Tuesday, was the subject of a "long and good conversation" by Glandorf.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me as much as they will inspire my long-time teammates and those who will follow me.
But I want to be available for my club in good health for the next few years, which requires longer periods of recovery, which the current double burden does not allow.
The left-hander had to fear the end of his career after a heel infection in 2012.
Because of Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone injection, which later caused severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other procedures followed.
Glandorf then filed a lawsuit against the team doctor, and the dispute ended in a settlement.
Twelve years in the pros and 11 years on the national team don't pass by a body without a trace.
I have some health construction sites I can't ignore anymore.
After three operations in 2012 for foot infections, I was never able to control my blood pressure properly.
This is in addition to some other wear-related complaints.
"I've been playing with my head for a long time, but I've learned that I can control my head, but I can't fool my body", Glandorf told Handball Time magazine in an interview.
He would only be willing to make a comeback in the event of an emergency.
"When things get tough, I'm always ready to talk", the father of two told the magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long stay in the hospital in 2012, I've also become quite humble about my health.
After my career, I'd like to be able to walk at least somewhat upright.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup of Cup Winners with Flensburg.
German economy shrunk by 0.2% in spring
The crises around the world have slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product declined by 0.2% from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was reported by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed by preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone boosted the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economic recovery.
The strong start to the year results in an overall GDP growth of 0.8 per cent in the first half of the year compared with the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which on Sunday for the first time led through the Burgmannstadt.
The town of Horstmar was invaded by Dutch "fietzers" on Sunday.
The biggest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "Münsterland-Mooiste".
It is the largest cycling tour in the whole of the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organising this tour of the Münsterland region by registering with him.
This tour was advertised in various magazines and offered to interested persons.
We're from Den Helder and we drove all night to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland region in this way", the cyclists said, delighted with the route through the Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld districts.
After registering at the clubhouse of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace ride" through the city over the Wall, where the launch took place.
The route, which was advertised for three different categories, continued in the direction of Herrenholz over the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
The cyclists proved their fitness on routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometres with 1475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometres with 1775 metres of altitude.
They were fed on the way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organiser Jos ter Huerne and deputy mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a good experience for all involved.
The organisation went smoothly and there were no negative incidents", said Heinz Lölfing, who drew a positive conclusion from the event.
Unfortunately, the number of participants was not as high as the organisers had hoped, probably due to the bad weather forecast and the morning rain.
"We will see you again in 2015 with hopefully good weather on August 30 or during another weekend", the cyclists promised but nevertheless returned to Münsterland and the organizers plan a new edition.
The ruthlessly honest memoirs of Konstantin Wecker
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, put on paper in "Monk and Warrior" in 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more bits and pieces of thought for bits and pieces of thought, the Munich native, born on June 1, 1947, has written down his memoirs, each chapter introduced by a suitable lyric.
And he's relentlessly honest about it, from high school masturbation to shoplifting and drug use, not letting up on human weakness.
He also showed how he himself had learned tolerance in his dealings with fellow humans.
He also explores the more abstract but more important concepts of love, soul, ego, being in the present, spirituality, all of which he tries to explore in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
He also explains his pacifism, social criticism, political involvement - and how he was not only shaped by music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also by his imprisonment.
The latter has also brought Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who is created "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving out everything unnecessary".
But in between all the high-minded views, there are short anecdotes about the earth: about a brawl in a bar frequented by GIs, or a crazy car ride in which he aimed at a tree.
He's also ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children born to a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is auditioning for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was developed from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He's been in "many" therapies since his mother's death, and Henry is reflecting on his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, you heard his voice, "Stop making noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Get out of the way!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were adults when I was a child - would go to the pub with him and talk about things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket bat.
I never had a conversation like that with him.
For most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner reading the paper.
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than they were in his father's day, he has gained a glimpse of what life might have been like for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoky, deep Stygian labyrinths with bursts of flame and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father used to just lie in the bath and then you could hear him slowly start singing because he could wash the foundry off of himself.
As I walked around, I realized that he had been doing this for years to put food on the table, and my respect for him grew.
Yet, as a child, Henry grew up without his parents' love letters.
My father never hugged me, never said "I love you".
It wasn't until my mother was getting sick at the end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you".
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Will you stop saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me, will you?
Dad, I'm 22 years old
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He's still friends with French, who he was married to for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
It contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I went through this whole fitness thing, and I also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very heavy.
And it is tiring.
Nobody likes carrots.
Henry's career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been in love with the theatre.
It was followed by The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
It's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started when he was only 16 years old, working in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage, impersonating people, and he wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television for quite a long time".
He was a student.
Not only did I have to grow up in the public eye, but from 1975 to 1985, I had to learn how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while being a star through television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in 1975 with New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage rights to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted themselves black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret doing it.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I was working on huge projects and learning how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-long prize-winning lightweight staple of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people".
By introducing characters who both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked in the 1980s on an alternative comedy circuit.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s, he was known for his role as chef Gareth Blacklock on the comedy series Chef!
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it all feels like you're just passing the time or stepping on the spot a little bit".
This was followed by a series of documentaries for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I never really learned anything about him in school, and I thought he was mostly a middle-class dude, white man in tights, with a head of cabbage in the front.
So I was terrified of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, they all said, "You should try it.
Don't make it worse if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put a few words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic.
I felt I could do it.
It was almost like someone finally got my head straight.
"That's why it's going on, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your lines, do a little research.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and it just didn't happen.
And soon he was performing in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed".
There was a technical glitch, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me, 'You've got 10 minutes to bridge while they fix the computer.'"
Instead, the stage manager announced that the show would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God".
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave that to someone else.
"You're in a play, so stay in your role".
Henry Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lyrics for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
This too was well received, so it's like a great shield of the gods, saying to me, "This is your destiny".
He says this, of course, in a thunderous voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really love this.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is permeated with witty outbursts as he imitates people over and over again.
I decided not to do stand-up comedy because I think that kind of instant gratification from a room full of strangers is kind of dangerous.
You keep looking for it, you'll hit a wall.
I do live gigs at the Apollo sometimes when I feel like it, but overall, I don't get as much as I used to.
I'm gonna ask him if he's ever gonna do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director, helping to shape the beginning, middle and end of a journey -- I don't think I'll ever want to give that up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love the stories.
People like stories.
Houthi rebels block roads in the Yemeni capital
In the conflict between Shia Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sana'a.
Houthi supporters occupied central roads in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party "Ansar Allah" said.
The access to Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media reports a traffic jam in the capital.
According to the online edition of the Yemen Post newspaper, Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for the measures on Sunday evening.
Houthi threatened further escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met, according to the leaflet.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence from the Sunni-ruled Yemen and are calling for the government to resign.
The Houthis have been besieging the Yemeni capital for nearly two weeks.
Some 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps along the main roads leading to Sanaa.
The region is still in the throes of bloody fighting with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to curb "ghost workers"
Kenya has started to register all government officials with biometrics to remove "ghost employees" from the government payroll.
Employees who fail to register within the next two weeks will not be paid, a government statement said.
The government estimates that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta, when he took office in 2013, promised to fight corruption in the public service.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) a month was lost in payments to "ghost employees" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be paid into accounts after a person dies or leaves public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centers within the next two weeks to ensure that their biometric records are recorded, a government message said.
Anyone who did not do so without a credible excuse would be removed from the payroll, the statement continued.
"This approach will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the civil service by establishing the actual number of officials and also adjusting the payroll at both levels of government - thus eliminating the 'ghost employees'", said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be heard in court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are seeking €19.4 million in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies, which are in insolvency proceedings, in a civil action before the Düsseldorf Regional Court.
A court spokeswoman said on Monday.
The complaint alleges that Achenbach cheated in the purchase of artworks and antiques and that Berthold Albrecht charged higher prices than were actually paid.
This also increased the agreed commission.
Achenbach had bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was in the school service for 44 years, 23 of them as a school principal.
Manfred Richter knows many famous Petershauseners and Kollbacher from this period as their students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always borne by his desire to see the human in the disciple.
Snowcapped is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau, now Trutnov.
At the age of 14, after four years of secondary school, he became interested in the teaching profession.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, we left for Bavaria in 1946 - in a freight car.
So it slipped Richter into the Upper Frankish village Senkendorf.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To do so, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week for ten kilometers to the nearest train station, then take the train to Bamberg, then walk two miles across the city to school, and then walk back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a place to sleep in a Red Cross home in Bamberg, together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951 he took the first and in 1954 after three years of teacher candidates the second state examination.
As Oberfranken had no free teaching position for him, he applied to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "girl's room" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he moved into a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school in Kollbach had been dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach school association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were consolidated in Petershausen in the present-day town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a relegation in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and from September 1982 the children and their teachers were able to occupy the current building, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had an additional workshop built at the expense of the municipality and in the 1997 expansion cellars, although this was not eligible according to the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly", Richter recalled gratefully.
Throughout his career Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government official who replied to a school board report on law and justice: "Love is never forgotten". Manfred Richter put into practice what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give your children two things: roots and wings", says the now 84-year-old.
And he had to learn, "You don't always get that". Whether he meant only his students or his own six children, it's not clear.
In each case, what Judge did was sometimes unconventional.
If students fought, he did not give them a punishment or a late-night sitting.
Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves purchased at the expense of the community and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there was a chance of a sale.
For the benefit of the school, Richter maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the non-partisan judge, after his retirement, to run for the municipal council in 1996 at least as the last on the CSU list.
But Richter was picked sixth and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
700 cyclists stop in the spa town of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists stop in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten during their tour, it is not special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of Rastenden alone made an impression: the 700 participants of the hr4 cycling tour, including the accompanying trolley, enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in the Scottish Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Riding and celebrating on newly discovered routes between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday, the situation became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, 60 kilometers across Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had been cycling in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the Bad Salzhausen own company, Petra Schwing-Döring.
To refresh the body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: The rural women of Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, zucchini, spruce and cheese cakes, which delighted the skilled cyclists.
"Only rural women can bake such cakes", praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
The drinks stand of the gym Geiß-Nidda was a place to buy cold refreshments.
The Duo Bravo entertained the audience with familiar melodies from operettas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
One man also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has today reattached already detached bicycle chains".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed by reporter Rainer Janke at the fountain in front of the drinking house and took the opportunity to advertise Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
The promotion manager Tobias Hagen, who had been the tour guide since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004, could only breathe a sigh of relief, as he had a lot to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he used three telephones and a radio to communicate with his staff and the 15-strong motorcycle squad of the Hessen police, wrote Facebook posts and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main region", he said, "but there are also cyclists from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus and even from many towns in Westphalia.
The number of participants varies a bit according to the available overnight capacity.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II, in group accommodation.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they left after an hour and a half: "Good-bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening, the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburg Park.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing (STS), the park had maintained a nice festive atmosphere and, of course, had prepared delicacies such as flamme cake with well-cooled white plumage.
The meeting was attended by Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs, in his capacity as a member of the ADAC Hesse-Thüringen Executive Board.
The three were clearly delighted with the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance floor.
Despite the sporty cycling, the opportunity for a brisk ride in the open air was eagerly seized.
The guests were increasingly mixed with citizens, who were as much delighted by the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the program included the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldres.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes arrived back in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish Police Arrested for "Conspiracy" Against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", local media outlets report.
Police authorities gave no immediate comment.
Among those arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, Hürriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly forming an organized criminal group and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities led by Islamist cleric Fethulla Gülen against him and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine are returning to school
Schools opened almost everywhere in Ukraine on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The skies are not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, head of the school in Slavyansk, which visits Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally reign here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in later life.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands, and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director they need.
She arrives with a proud herd of fame from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she's got her own frontline experience.
Her career began at the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., before moving to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearson.
She was chairman of the board of the Financial Times for seven years, stepping down when the top job at Pearson's parent company went to a younger male colleague.
Her severance was reportedly nearly £1 million.
Their political rankings are also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private sector expertise in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory councilman.
In May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC stand as a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: internally as the first guard of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also externally as a voice of public concern and concern when things go wrong.
This creates an almost untenable duopoly which calls for complete and comprehensive reform.
But what new chairman would risk stepping in, hitting everything and tearing apart an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while potentially taking his own job in the process.
It's a difficult task.
And if that's not enough, there are many who are interested in seeing the BBC reduced to a thing of power, money and status.
As competition is getting closer and new technologies are threatening old, comfortable security, the upcoming BBC royalty negotiations are posing particular risks.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying into what is arguably the largest media company in the world.
The BBC has a good story: they say it reaches 96 percent of all households, and each of them costs only 40 pence a day.
And it seems the BBC is climbing back up the popularity ladder, with 53 percent supporting it today, up from 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC's viewing and viewing habits have changed: I now get news headlines on my phone and watch missed programmes later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a much-loved and respected institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she's found him.
Perry of Texas says that derogatory tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official account of Republican Texas Governor Rick Perry on Sunday included a disparaging remark about the Democratic district attorney who is the focus of a criminal complaint against him for abuse of office.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced with another by Perry's account, which contradicts the previous one.
There was a tweet just sent from my account that I didn't authorize.
"I don't approve of the tweet and have deleted it", the message said later.
Perry's staff did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Although the tweets originated from Perry's official user account, it was not clear who actually operates the feed.
The earlier tweet painted an unfavorable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed a financial subsidy for her office when she refused to step down, leading to an indictment of Perry - who could potentially be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk with triple the legal limit... but if I do, I will sue Governor Perry if he speaks out".
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office wasn't assigned to lead the grand jury investigation into Perry.
It was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the prosecution a political ploy.
His high-profile team of lawyers petitioned the judge assigned to the case to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the law, which is being used against the longest-serving governor in Texas history, is unconstitutionally vague.
Perry withheld $7.5 million in state funds from the state's Public Integrity Unit - based in Travis County and investigating state corruption cases in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto prompted a public complaint by a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official account is frequently updated - and sometimes famously.
After finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry addressed speculation that he would end it by tweeting a photo of himself jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley says housing market is back to "normal"
One of London's most prominent developers pointed out that the housing market in southeast England had "returned" to normal levels.
Home ownership in the capital was in high demand and subject to huge price rises, prompting the Bank of England to set mortgage lending ceilings in June, in response to widespread fears of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the board of Berkeley, a high-end construction company, said on Monday that "since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013", adding that this provides a "stable trading environment".
The London property market was in good shape during the downturn as foreign buyers poured into the capital.
According to the Cadastral Office, prices in the metropolitan area have soared by 18.5 percent in the past year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average selling prices for Berkeley's private, affordable and student offerings rose by about one fifth over the past year to £423,000 at the end of April.
But a stronger pound has made London property less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "villa tax" ahead of next May's general election.
London property broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which introduced tighter lending rules, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday shows a drop in mortgage approvals in July, which also indicates that the housing market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, revised down its forecast for the increase in London property prices for 2015 to 3 percent, based on already weakening house price awareness.
Transaction volume in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now fallen by a quarter year on year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, as the amount due for sales is more than £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, well-planned product in the best locations has remained stable and as a result, term sales have remained stable".
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual pre-tax income rose by 40 per cent to £280 million, turnover by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said Berkeley's revenue for the current year was expected to be in line with current market expectations.
The analysts are unanimous in estimating the annual pre-tax result at £450 million.
Berkeley shares were firm at £23.96 on the London market this afternoon.
Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos are being leaked online by hackers
Jennifer Lawrence is performing at the 85th Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of 100 other celebrities.
A representative for the star of "Tribute to Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and sued the hacker for "blatant violation of privacy".
Authorities have been notified and will pursue anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, originally posted on the photo-sharing site 4chan, were allegedly obtained through a leak in Apple's iCloud online storage system.The alleged "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It's not clear how many of the images are real, though Winstead, star of "Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World", also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who are looking at pictures my husband and I took years ago in the privacy of our home - I hope you are really happy with yourselves", Winstead tweeted.
However, Justice Victoria from Nickelodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied that the photos were of her, tweeting "These so-called nude pictures of me are FUN, folks.
Let's get this started.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They disintegrated, that's the best way to describe it, they dissolved slowly like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Occasionally a woman would tell him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, aloof, and perhaps a little scratchy.
And then I shook his hand.
He knew it was scratchy.
He was a little bit of a hedgehog, yeah.
The last victim of this prickly nature was a newly begun affair that had been more promising than any other for the relief of the lonely boredom of his life, and might even have brought him a certain satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling, delicate beauty with unrestrained hair and a fluttering heart from a village in the North Island that was even more remote and rugged than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion who thought Kevern was her aunt and who had inherited a piece of land in a damp but paradisiacal valley aptly named Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, the bathrooms were full of spiders, the fireflies had left their mark on all the windows, thinking they owned it all, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author by Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn had sat hand in hand on the broken deck chairs in the tall grass, enjoying an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had drifted into the console of service, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing messages, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, whose father had enjoyed listening to him at closed roller rinks in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - nothing was really banned - just not played.
It has been successfully obsoleted, as has the word obsolete.
General taste did what decrees and regulations could never do, and as people chose the From-a-Placer-to-a-Millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and love stories for books, so they chose the ballads for music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing Ailinn's big feet in a crude-comic serenade.
Ailinn did not understand.
"It was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller", he explained to her, and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J from coming out of his mouth.
It started as a game between him and his father when he was a little boy.
His father had played it with his own father, he said.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers on your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't a very fun game now.
He knew that was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was not played, even if it wasn't outright forbidden.
Improvisation was out of fashion.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure where a tune would end at the beginning.
So is the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the musical expression of the mind.
Although he had reached the age of 10 without having heard Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A conformist society meant that every element of that society gratefully agreed to the principle of group endowment - gratefully as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent were suited by temperament and physique to entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were tasked with ensuring that no family was left without a working service telephone.
What was left of the Polish community was in charge of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks was in charge of the smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf and the Levant whose grandparents had not left the country as soon as it happened, when it happened - for fear of being accused of racial hatred, even fear that the flames would consume them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha whistle restaurants, were apprehensive and became depressed with inaction.
Each according to his ability.
Having heard only ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung to her could ever be misinterpreted.
Music was an expression of love.
"These are not really offensive", said Kevern.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved that song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the false sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound-proofing of the huge coallike leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was something special.
"He thought it was funny", he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief, blocking Kevern's view.
There was nothing to see in the whole world but her uncombed, raven-black hair.
There was nothing he wanted to see.
"If you say so", she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed genuinely concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet are not so much.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit of...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too big?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you", but it was too soon.
"Your thick ankles are exactly why I like you", he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted here.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because he didn't have the soothing charm his father had, which was needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel, too.
Maybe that's what he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and got up from her reclining chair, knocked over the console and spilled the wine they had drunk.
Cottonwood blossom wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble like palm fronds in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I'm perversely attracted to you", she said...
Except that's not who I am.
He felt sorry for her, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that showed in her eyes as she rebelled against him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She hadn't told him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same vast, icy ocean broke up here as it did on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more annoying according to what happened than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or mocked them.
What are you, a big-head?
They'd have given her a big fist if she wasn't careful!
They first snuggle -- snuggle was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console -- they first snuggle and then they hit.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the kissing itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a signal to walk through her body.
He rose from the couch like an old man.
She felt leaden, too, but the intensity of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
You hardly knew each other.
She watched him go away - as her companion watched him from an upstairs room - a man troubled by something he had himself conjured up.
Adam is leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, even though some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without fighting spirit - why was this a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen anything like it before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked up at her feet.
Several years before the events described above, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working for Ofnow, the non-legislative watchdog of public sentiment, was working on a short presentation on the continuing low- and middle-level violence in the very parts of the country where it was most likely to be reduced, if not eliminated, given the money and energy invested in eradicating it.
"Much has been done, and much still remains to be done", she wrote, "to pacify the innate aggressiveness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the land where, historically, the sweet breath of human kindness has seldom been felt, despite the towering church towers between the hedges.
But some traits prove to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less passion it continues to arouse.
The population weeps at the sentimental ballads, revels in stories of overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only does the former crudeness hold rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in its grip, but there is evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious streak at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate", her mentor said after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I think I don't have to say that", answered Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Again, Esme invoked her right to privacy and refused to testify.
A feminist?
Silence again.
"I'm not asking", Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a non-prejudice workplace.
We serve a society free of prejudice.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are in themselves absolutely acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort the results as you have presented them.
You yourself are obviously prejudiced against the Church, and these things that you call "backward" and "raw" could just as well be interpreted by others as expressions of a natural force and vitality.
To go on with what has happened, when it has happened, as if it had happened yesterday, is to deprive the country of its essential vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a flaming pink LED sign repeated the advice Ofnow had given the country for the last quarter-century or more.
Smile at your neighbors, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the word sung is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand perfectly well what you are trying to say", replied Esme Nussbaum in a calm voice, when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I can only say that we are not as effectively cured as we imagine ourselves to be.
My concern is that without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to WHAT IS HAPPENED WHEN IT HAPPENED.
But this time, it's not the others we're taking out our anger and our distrust on.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To suggest that you're having a little angel patience.
"You go too far", he said, "by calling actions "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
You go too far when you say that they have vented their "anger" and "distrust" to "others".
It shouldn't be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past as well as in protecting the present, we don't talk about "us" and "others".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of turmoil, that's all we know.
"Of which, if we are honest with ourselves", Esme ventured to interject, "no section of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it's done well or badly, what's done is done.
That was then.
I think that is the only way to ensure that the Community is able to take part in the negotiations.
And just as no debt needs to be assigned, no debt needs to be cancelled if such cancellation is appropriate and if there is a way to cancel it.
But what is the use of the past if we don't learn from it -
The past is what makes us forget it.
If I may say so ...
Luther Rabinowitz had his pyramid collapse.
"I'll consider your report", he said and dismissed her.
The next day, as she was going to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passersby described it, had been riding down the sidewalk in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; PM stays in South Africa
Officials in Lesotho's military denied planning a coup to overthrow the government and said they were targeting police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the country's army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Prime Minister moved his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting on assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no de facto coup but that the military was responding to the threat of "political fanatics" whose arming by the police was imminent.
"What happened this morning was that the headquarters of the Lesotho Defence Force acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there were some elements within the police who were actually arming some of the political, partisan young fanatics who were on the verge of doing devastating damage", he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action appeared to be a coup.
"Although no one has claimed to have taken over the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of the Lesotho Defence Force so far show signs of a coup d'état", he said.
Lesotho's military spokesman said on Sunday that the soldiers had retreated to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was calm.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing will take over the government in Thabane's absence.
Thabane shared that he believes he has been targeted for his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there has been great tension since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements within his unity government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Production in the euro area at 13-month low
The growth in output in the euro area slowed to its lowest point in 13 months in August, according to a closely monitored study.
The final Markit Purchasing Managers' Index of Manufacturing (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion.
New orders declined and factories experienced break-ins at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures are due to be released before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a faltering eurozone recovery and the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB President Mario Draghi may make further announcements later this week on whether he is considering quantitative easing for the eurozone, similar to those undertaken by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although little growth is better than no growth, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more evident for manufacturers", said Rob Dobson, Markit's chief economist.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the meantime, in the bloc's second largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a worrying child, as does Italy's descent from solid expansion to stagnation.
The evidence that growth incentives are no longer working in the Key Industrial Mechanism in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands is also not reassuring", said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing about the August Eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers index is that the sector continues to grow after that".
He added: 'Producers in the euro area are apparently finding life quite difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine - add to the uncertainties in the continued difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, consumer confidence - and are likely to delay or even cancel some contracts, particularly large ones.
He said that it was becoming "more and more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to introduce some form of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited".
The decade of hell for the Beslan survivors: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children involved still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militiamen at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific Beslan school siege that killed 334 people, including 186 children, heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists kidnapped and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united the West and the East in horror, and then, surprisingly, turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst of misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom atrocity.
We found surprising young people who overcame resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now plaguing Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - is now coming to an end.
The girl photographed trying to climb back into the destroyed school gym
She was photographed by Russian star photographer Dmitri Beliakov and famously attempted to climb back into the school's demolished sports hall in her underwear after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were presumed dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't", Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back inside to look for my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely cured, but yesterday she said: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to have another surgery.
Some shrapnel still in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist, to help people as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me", she says, with a vengeance.
"That's what happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed behind.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We used to play together when we were little and we used to dream of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish college and start my career.
I'll think about a family later.
She says that the siege will always be a part of her, although the memory will fade a little bit each year.
I'm glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in Britain and all over the world.
When I see the picture of me climbing back to school online, I think a lot of people are seeing it for the first time, understanding our catastrophe and helping to prevent this from happening again.
The boy who ran through the hail of bullets, thinking his mother was dead.
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at 7 years old) and he survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "My mother told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down and hold her hand".
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run".
Fearing she might be dead, he ran away and saw a crying child on the road, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who was holding his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her".
In reality, Tamara had stumbled out of the hospital with leg injuries, believing her son had died.
After her reunion, she said: "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now-dissolved News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering", he said yesterday.
But I can say that it's fading in my memory.
I remember immediately afterwards I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I used to play with in the yard, and they didn't make it out.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We'll say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially to the toy store, where I could pick out anything I wanted, and the ride in a car with the top open.
But now he's afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misery that he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors", said Damir, who volunteered at a monastery last week.
I'm so happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the awful silence after the siege, there were just no children to shout and run around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly recalls her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped me and Damir.
I remember how Damir liked to eat borsch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant, and Damir shot them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think that this world has not gotten any better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is going on now, and people are dying every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They're just like our kids.
I think for many people, war is part of the news that they hear when they're bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that's so sad.
Damir grew up to be a very gentle and calm boy, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from class, and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles.
When he was younger, he suffered from it -- I remember sometimes he would lie on the couch, his face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys, and Damir is now 17 years older than me, handsome, intelligent, and healthy.
I can't believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I was recovering from the explosion and getting back on my feet, I looked around and saw hell all around me, with body parts lying all over.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling him, 'Damir, run, run away,' but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, continues for us.
Georgiy Ilyin, 17 years old
The boy whose horrible image became the symbol of the Beslan atrocity after the siege
Comfort: Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-stained face was marked by fear as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His painting was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before rushing off to take her older son, Vladimir, to university.
"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy was left there alone for three terrible days", she recalls.
Not entirely alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer we get to that date, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day that goes by that we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been long, I mean, it was yesterday, some scenes from those days haunt me.
No one will ever forget this, I promise you.
Intimate: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I didn't know he was alive until I saw him on TV.
And now there's even this statue of crying George in San Marino.
Georgi doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden in our bookcase at home.
I understand that, but I also think that people all over the world feel our pain because of this picture.
Georgij now says: "It is important that something like this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People keep investigating these tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of that Boeing in the Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is turning into something terrible.
"I can't understand how that's possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing compared to this pain.
It takes us decades to forget a little bit.
It's attacked my health, and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had some nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and I was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when September 1st is coming up.
I want to pay my respects to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I won't feel sorry for myself.
My life is moving on.
I graduated this year and I'm going to medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to train in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
Georgi Fanijev, 20 years old
The boy who survived being trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgi Fanijev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gym, sitting next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's a miracle he didn't get killed.
"We feel as if it was yesterday", says Georgij, who wanted to join the FSB as an intelligence officer but was unable to do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and people say that children can handle bad experiences easily -- I have to say, that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 -- the year after -- was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I'm never going back there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in that famous painting.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijev today, with a laptop photo of himself in the hospital after the siege
My pain is terrible, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
Physically, I'm fine. I'm not worried about it.
I should have been careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I was unable to study at the FSB Academy of Intelligence in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical ones, and they said it's not possible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary school.
I've been there two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows".
He said: "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about it and they should not suffer it.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I'll go to the memorial service.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be a lot more intense for him, because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that it was returned to me, and here in Beslan, all of them are drawn by it.
It stays with us.
Georgi is now an adult, but this horror is still inside him.
It's hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he doesn't do any sports.
I'd say he's over the horror by 50%, but you can never completely get over it and forget it.
This terrible experience will haunt us forever.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and that only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and loved.
My son is with me, and he is the greatest gift God could have given me, but my heart weeps for the dead.
I know of families that have had new children, but also of widows who have never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even when you don't want it to.
I'll never forget the way my heart leaped when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how come we're fighting now?
I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more will be killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out as far away as possible.
Alyona Tskhayeva, 10 years old
The baby so tenderly carried to safety by a special operations command
Rescued: Alyona Tskajewa is brought to safety by a Russian special operations command (left).
She is now ten years old and has no memory of the atrocities
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty, they held their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina, and her brother Makhar in the school gymnasium.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, has no memory of the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They are now a big happy family, and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids", says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of driving girls over on crosswalk in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for the car crash that killed a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian overpass in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl on the crossing at Pittenween in the East Neuk.
The prosecution alleges that Mr. Steward drove his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, has denied the charge in Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC has scheduled the proceedings for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you like to take pictures or videos underwater, there's a selection of equipment.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300 USD.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all of which are available for under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for the dim underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check how deep your equipment is functioning.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Look in our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cameras usually don't.
Even if you have an LCD, it's difficult to see this underwater, and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So you do a lot of filming.
If your camera has a serial mode, which allows you to take a series of pictures with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you go from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or ocean.
This also allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you'll see.
Get close to the objects.
That's good advice on land, but it's even more important underwater because of the poor lighting.
This is particularly important if you're working with an action camera: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you have to get closer to your subjects if they're going to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of man whose character would change things, even in an organization as gigantic as the NHS.
As a consultant anaesthetist, he dedicated his career to sparing the patient both the agony of illness and the agony of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors were concerned with diagnoses and diseases, while patients were mostly concerned with something else entirely: pain.
But one day in 2007, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel", he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble getting up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently accusing his wife, Juliet.
"I'd rather have it now than later", he noted.
When Juliet was away on business for a week, Lawson felt unusually and unreasonably worried.
There was something in the air.
He asked a colleague to take an X-ray of his chest.
Two weeks ago, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-rays were in.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast, the skin covering the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact cause is often difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients are former smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, exposure to asbestos - contact with the fibrous material once considered a "miracle" but now recognized as deadly - is the cause.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that we can easily ignore.
Asbestos is a thing of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily committed itself to discontinue its use.
Even where it was used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters, and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from a different era, it seems to be of little concern today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the peak of a mesothelioma epidemic today.
There are more mesothelioma deaths here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths a year, it kills twice as many people as road accidents.
Annual numbers of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason we are experiencing the deadly effects now, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999) is that mesothelioma takes decades to develop.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former construction workers.
Asbestos has been, and often still is, in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn and the stores where we shop.
And so mesothelioma knows no class barriers, no financial boundaries, no occupation or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no safe haven.
The parliament buildings are asbestos-contaminated.
Even the hospitals, where we are supposed to be cured, have been designated as the starting point for this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
He found it difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It appears that there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years of my training", he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and janitors use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease.
Unfortunately, he was able to answer at least part of that question.
"Of the four doctors who trained at Guy's Hospital and who have developed mesothelioma in the last five years", he wrote in a 2010 letter, "I am the last one still alive".
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends in death.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still get sick?"
Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, estimates that between 1870 and 2050, when the UK's asbestos epidemic is expected to end, a total of 90,000 will have died from the disease.
Most of them don't have any idea that they're going to die like this yet.

A brief look at the court files frequently used by victims to seek compensation shows how widespread the scourge of mesothelioma is.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, admitted that Janice Allen had been exposed to asbestos in a careless manner.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 when she started her career at M&S.
Now she has two children in their twenties.
"Before this", she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, and I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought it would be about me.
There are only a few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to one substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common asbestos found in buildings today.
It's been used for roof panels, floorboards, pipe insulation, boiler joints, even brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered by the EU and the WHO as a "major health risk" with possible fatal consequences.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amocite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
The UK was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high levels of mesothelioma".

Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is not at all unusual.
He has presented a study of the affected persons which shows that "a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas without known exposure were probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment, either at work or at home".
Much of this contact, he said, was based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, reveals how people in the heart of government may have been unwittingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind the Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be stirred up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
The Commission has already taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Community's budgetary resources are used to the full.
While the Parliamentary Labour Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had been given a 'clean health certificate', it is now undeniable that £1 billion of work over several years will be required to renovate the Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, MPs will probably meet at the nearby QE2 Conference Centre rather than at the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also noted that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant regulations".
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to determine the exact contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
As Andrew Lawson suspects, 50-year-old Abbott was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos charges were ruled in favor", he says, "but I cannot prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places you've worked and all the dates.
What he remembers most vividly is the day in early December of 2009, when he got this kind of fever.
He was 45, and he was performing a late-night surgery.
Suddenly I had a chill.
It came out of nowhere.
I felt terrible.
I thought I'd never make it home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the chest, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays of his chest and applied pleural cauterization to extract fluid from his lungs and test it in the laboratory.
His complaints, however, remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his work.
However, from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient from Abbott's came into his practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But Abbott didn't connect this to his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again and his GP took his CT scans and X-rays to an expert panel.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt ill, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the cavity between the ribs and the chest.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going", he says.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't that worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy came back in the week between Christmas and New Year's, and he said, "They told me it was mesothelioma".
I was diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Suddenly, Abbott had a meeting with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to get a lawyer.
Only now did he realize the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very common, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos", he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in those buildings are now getting sick.
And so mesothelioma now affects younger people who have not worked in the typical occupations.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably less likely to be exposed to the material.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (as Andrew Lawson did) or ate in underground cafeterias (as Graham Abbott often did) were more likely to come into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that for several decades after the war, hospitals were potentially life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the attending physicians.
It is still being removed today.
Students put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats and then put them on the floor.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos, with its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties, was widely used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls.
Schools too.
In fact, many people may have had their first exposure to asbestos in the classroom.
All over the country, in thousands of chemistry lessons, students have left their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
Web sites are now frequently used to raise the issue of asbestos in schools.
And yet, such innocent items in our homes as floorboards or shed roofs have become asbestos-laden by default.
"It's an industrial poison that's in large parts of our property", notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact an affected woman had was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you tear down your garden shed.
The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process", says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in the office for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not gonna see another Christmas.
The biggest challenge was to change the perspective from the doctor's to the patient's.
Like countless patients before him, he recalls how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to record all this", he says.
"I asked my doctor, 'How long do I have left?'
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
That's it then.
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-sustaining mechanism -- the breath itself -- that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos exposure.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When the asbestos is stirred up and the fibers are inhaled, they can become lodged in the chest cavity, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest wall and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is with the needle-shaped asbestos fibres inhaled", says Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiothoracic surgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital that Andrew Lawson suspected exposed him to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who may have also been exposed to asbestos during their hospital training.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "their breathing presses them to the edge where the skin is.
It's intrusive by nature from the start.
The usual options for other cancers don't work as well for mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotly debated.
Some say it's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the rib cage", he says.
You're not getting around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy", which "works", but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors", says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live a long time, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After coming into contact with mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and counseling office for fellow sufferers.
"Hello, Cancer Center", he introduced himself cheerfully when we called.
"He was very positive", says Abbott.
He had been diagnosed four years earlier and was still very active.
Abbott had originally been offered six cycles of chemotherapy, lasting four months and expected to prolong his life by only a month.
"I was desperate", he says.
I wanted to quit.
Lawson, however, "was able to put things in a slightly more positive light".
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a cardiothorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had the advantage of not having to be referred, I just called and got an appointment", Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a referral and wait for treatment approval.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to receive the best available therapies.
But when these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers face another financial concern - the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Fisher Field Waterhouse LLP. He was a lawyer.
"The health hazards of asbestos have been known since 1898", says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was the realization that even very little exposure was a health risk.
And here, corporate negligence began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually dropped their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation" because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to asbestos exposure at Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a spokesman for Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected basement were removed in the 1990s".
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma victims seeking compensation, it is a huge problem to attribute the deadly exposure to asbestos to a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed down.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is theirs, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, this year saw significant new legislation that makes it easier for those affected by mesothelioma to seek compensation even if their former employers are no longer available.
The Act has created a £350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court would have awarded them in a normal compensation case - about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications are expected to be received per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks, like so many mesothelioma victims, that £350 million was "very good business" for the insurance industry.
"This is an insurer-for-insurer deal", he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time hadn't passed and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them as normal.
Mike Penning, then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that with seven deaths a day, quick action was necessary.
"People are suffering so much and need help today", Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Bill in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which he expected to have a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that has given Lang-Lazdunski a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt empowered.
"That's of course with the most important thing", says Abbott.
You see it all the time in patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott had the surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Post-scan scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer stains around my breast.
I just turned 50.
It's not life-threatening.
It's life-giving.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of the tumors.
But the process is physically and mentally very exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm gone, for example, or showing my wife how the boiler time setting works.
When you get bad news, you become negative.
You have to look ahead.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents", he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I was first diagnosed, I told my daughter that I had a disease that I wouldn't live with.
They reacted in very different ways.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends, and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
These are conversations that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma sufferers, such conversations are not filled with hope, not with a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings, as it did for Stephen Jay Gould, a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong the right to govern, protesters vow retaliation
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament voted against Hong Kong voters nominating candidates for the 2017 elections despite increased calls for democratic reforms.
This action is believed to have fueled the long-anticipated protests in Hong Kong's business district, with activists planning and mobilizing for them within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle to reject all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry", said Emily Lau, a legal expert and chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been tricked.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy general secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that allowing public nominations in elections would be too "chaotic" for the Hong Kong government.
Since 1997, when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to let the residents vote for the head of government from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong citizens a direct vote, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership is keeping the process through a nomination committee tightly controlled by Beijing firmly in hand.
A new clause also says that only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision follows a summer that saw some of the largest and most high-profile protests in Hong Kong in years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district unless Beijing allows for genuine universal suffrage.
Within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government headquarters on Sunday evening.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they planned for a wave of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret to say that today all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for days for Beijing's announcement, and on Sunday, there were heightened security measures outside the government building, including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is being compounded by the feeling many in Hong Kong feel they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong's values of democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under Beijing's growing pressure.
Some criticized the Occupy Central demonstrations as endangering business operations - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
"The protests they are talking about could cause major economic damage depending on how many people are involved and how long they last", said legal expert Regine Ip, a longtime critic of the movement.
We don't want to raise any fears that Hong Kong is going to get out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported on Hong Kong's democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which was attended by 780,000 people - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of proms in the U.S. is now being transferred to the universities, where freshmen performances are offered by private jet.
We are delighted to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the UK's first luxury travel service for today's students.
To make a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also indicated that the service has a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to haul their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students this year will arrive at university with a minimum of expense and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said that there were no new bookings yet as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students will be booking the service in the coming weeks".
The company also stated that, despite the tuition fees of £9000 per year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today have very different expectations and demands than students 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago -- it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF, you can do just that.
The National Union of Students, however, criticized the service as being out of touch.
Megan Dunn, NUS's vice-president for higher education, said: "This offer seems completely disconnected from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students starting university this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis as the financial aid available in the form of loans and scholarships is not keeping up with the sharply rising bills for the most basic of living conditions before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the hostel.
Feminists criticize race issues and police conduct after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer earlier this month in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot", as they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo. over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the online discussions of white feminists.
In their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
But as tensions in the Midwest rose and gained national attention, Perez found that white women's responses were 100 percent about race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shootings, the personal essays with titles like "Thoughts on Ferguson from a White Woman" and "Feminism is not just about oppressing women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, it was a big change.
"I don't think you'll find many people in feminism who talk about being white and privilege in such a high-class way", she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the events.
It's characteristic of the crisis we're in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express that.
For Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light issues faced by black women every day that are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural realm.
"I can post something funny about me and my partner on Facebook and get 150 likes from everywhere", Mitchell said.
When I post about how people of color are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk about a relationship in public, but not about safety in public?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the issues neatly; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now link race and gender issues in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their female predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman", Hattery said.
White women had to be part of the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point where white suffragists like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 1800s and found that the fight for suffrage could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to campaign for women's suffrage, and the suffrage for blacks was to come later", Hattery said.
When you remember things like that, you become powerfully aware of why women of color don't trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We've never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original appeal for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police conduct, racial discrimination - is a reflection of the time when white feminists played "catch" with the issues that black women have been grappling with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to birth control?" asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists who built their careers on fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now trying to understand what this means.
Noted white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a poignant article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist for the Guardian, calling for more protests by white Americans over racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about race that are markedly different in public polls - will lead the change", Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism, in which race as well as gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on race in America are puzzling.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters", but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are in contrast to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there was an angry response from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only issue that is thrusting into the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After US Border Patrol apprehended nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform is once again coming to the fore - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that to re-imagine the issue as a major women's issue, she only needed to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves", said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are echoed in women's organizations", she said.

The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made itself comfortable in the living room.
The detached one-bedroom house, situated on a private road in Ipswich, is being offered for £120,000.
Among the details was a drawing of the living room of the house - which included a pig with its head resting on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"The photo was mistakenly published and has since been removed", a company spokeswoman said.
In the house's exposition, Connells described the former meeting house as a "unique single-family house with one bedroom".
Although the realtor has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional materials.
The house sale sparked interest on social media as some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
Harvey, Southwest, is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery.
A lottery player from Harvey is due this month
The search for a new millionaire continues in south-west Perth, with a lucky winner drawing nearly $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey won the first division jackpot for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner has yet to report.
Store owner Steve Forward said the win would provide a talking point in the small town southwest of Perth.
It's all the talk of the town, and everybody's pretty excited.
We thought we might make a profit like that.
Eight WA winners celebrated first division victories last month, a fitting end to a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a Canning Vale gambler became one of the five millionaires in August, after a Belmont couple made the $7.5 million mega win just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the prize would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
Harvey's millionaire is the 59th division winner in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas was invited to the gladiator arena
It was not just the gladiators who stood knee-deep in the mud at the first Rheinbach Roman Day in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who braved the showers and the autumn cold and were enthusiastically entertained by the historic spectacle.
There was a colorful array of performances, plays, exhibits and information about the Roman period and its significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial combat troop of the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust martial art in the arena paved with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a witty and knowledgeable presenter, sending his men into the ring one after another for heroic dueling in various gladiator types.
First, it was the turn of the "provocateurs" with a rectangular shield and a sabre and leg rails on the left leg and arm rails on the right arm.
The "Essedarii" followed, wearing breastplate, sword and lance, and iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the performance of the "Retiarius", who with a throwing net, a trident and a dagger fought the "Secutor" and after a short fight knocked the guy to the ground.
Then the swords cracked metallic against each other, the shields shattered and the lances flew soaring through the arena that one could become terrified of the gladiators' health.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, had an ever-watchful eye.
"We wanted to revive the daily life of the Romans and to show the culture of the Roman era", explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the Friends' Circle Römerkanal, the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the theme park became an "Oppidum Romanum" for one day, a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest to our region but also Roman culture and the many buildings we still admire today.
Remnants of this were also to be admired in Roman times, such as "aqueduct marble" from the eleven-meter high and 1400 meter long Roman canal bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus company was comparing the water supply and the energy supply, and Petra Fricke, the company's managing director, knew that "we are still benefiting from the knowledge of that time".
This is also confirmed by the graduate surveyor Ralph Heiliger of the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented the surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm air heating system that once heated the Römervilla.
Also impressive are the footprints left by wolves and foxes two thousand years ago in the clay steps before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Land and Landscape Conservation at the Rhine State Association excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Industrial Park in Rheinbach.
They found the walls of a farmhouse with a threshing floor for drying grain and grinding.
The building was likely part of a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
She displayed a number of finds from these excavations in a glass case, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
The children also engaged in the Roman game of windmills, similar to today's game of grinding, or they wrote their names on wax tablets with metal scribbles, as Roman schoolchildren did.
At the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the glass museum Rheinbach, they were allowed to make glass mosaics and at the nature center Eifel Nettersheim, they were allowed to use a heavy stone wheat mill to grind the flour for a flatbread or a muesli.
The visitors drove through the amusement park in the original Roman caravan, pulled by two coldblooded animals, and passed the impressive stand of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Week".
The municipality of Wachtberg will also be participating in the Roman Week, which will be held from 13 to 21 September, as part of the 2014 Roman Year, which is being celebrated throughout the Rhineland and is intended to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the local and historical associations, the Wachtberg Wander-Verein, the Partnerschaftsverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, themed walks, a lecture, a cooking evening and guided tours for school classes are offered, and the Roman past of Wachtberg is remembered.
For example, a Roman legionary tells about his work on the traction-trapped Wachtberg, plants are presented as living monuments from the Roman era, and a witty lesson in international understanding is offered between a group of Wachtberg "Germans" and displaced Romans.
The Adendorf primary school devotes a project week to the subject of Rome.
The aim of the Roman Week is to make the numerous, but often no longer visible at first glance, traces of the Romans in Wachtberg visible again.
In the Wachtberg Town Hall, a small presentation will commemorate the discovery of the Berkumer Matronen Sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola: the economic impact of the epidemic in West Africa
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned and international companies are distanced.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is dealing a severe blow to the economy of West Africa.
The crops are rotten in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are deserted - the virus has hit the region hard.
Some international companies are already distancing themselves.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one", said Donald Kaberuka, the head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is the hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money", says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes at the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
The only people who come to the market are people who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola.
Liberia is the country hardest hit by the virus, with more than 600 people dying from the fever in this country alone.
Recently, health officials declared that the disease had spread to every corner of the country.
Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria have also been affected.
In all, more than 1,500 people have died, and thousands more have been infected.
Foreign firms withdraw staff
Companies are shutting down all over the resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies, such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal, are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
Local merchants and farmers are also responding, with fewer and fewer merchants leaving their homes to buy supplies.
In some quarantined areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, the cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for export, are rotting in the fields.
The farmers dare not leave their homes for the harvest.
Food shortages
"People are travelling less and less", says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Paris-based expert on the economy of West Africa.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market to sell his vegetables prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore directly and urgently affected by the epidemic: food is scarce.
In markets, basic foodstuffs like rice are running out of stock.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international firms, is threatened by a deterioration in its image - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest risk is that international companies will avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
The key is how far and for how long the virus will spread.
Investors may be led to believe "that it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia", warns Hugon.
The disease is also burdening the strained national budgets of the nations
The disease also puts a strain on the already strained national budgets of the affected countries.
Moody's fears that their budgets will be strained by high healthcare spending and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already pledged $60 million (€45 million) to help the health systems of the affected countries.
The impact is already felt in Nigeria, where few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region of the southern Niger Delta has not been affected.
But in other places, many people are already staying at home for fear of infection.
Reservations at hotels are also falling significantly.
The Schützen are celebrating their 50th anniversary
The "Tannenwald" Rifle Club of Berngau is celebrating its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
Preparations are in full swing at the Tannenwald shooting club for the 50th anniversary celebration from September 12 to 14.
There's a big entertainment night planned for Friday, September 12th with the group "Dorfrocker".
Saturday at 6 is the big bullfight.
Then, in the big tent, the evening of the mood with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam".
The orchestra is the music
Highlights on Sunday are the Sunday service at 9:30 a.m. in the parish church and the big procession at 2:00 p.m.
In the afternoon, the prize distribution for the federal and Gaussian shooting will be held.
The 25 ladies of the fair will be a particularly beautiful sight with their mirrors.
The orchestra is the Berngau Chamber Orchestra.
The event was hosted by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment by means of exercises in the shooting of small caliber and small caliber".
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who on April 30 in the guest house Lukas raised the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as a marksman through a difficult initial period, in which it was mainly about finding a club room and installing the shooting operation.
In the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, who were now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the first Gauliga.
The club records were broken every year and the magical limit of 380 rings was first reached in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the capacity of active shooters has increased, so has the membership.
After the club "Leininger" no longer met the requirements of a modern rifle club, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future home in the cellars of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After 2700 hours of work, on May 8, 1988, Father Strasser gave the church blessing for the new shooting areas.
One of the highlights in the club's history was certainly the 44th shooting, connected with the solemn dedication of the new Schützenflagge in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994 the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995 a group of bulls was formed.
Josef Schmalzl became the professor of Böll.
A great challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the organization of the Bavarian Böller Meeting in 2005.
In the course of many hours of volunteer work, the members of the club have modernized the rooms and the shooting range in the Berngauer Hof, bringing them up to the latest state of technology.
Eleven teams in round robin competition
The sports activities of the shooting club can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams currently participate in the round-robin matches: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one sport pistol KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has been promoted from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the District League 1 in the round 2013/14.
The second team with Verena Moosburger, Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has moved from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as goat steaks, Faschings- and Königsball, club excursions and Christmas celebrations are traditionally held.
The parish and community feasts are also attended by the parishioners.
Tony Stewart crashes on his way back to the track
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended about halfway through his race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the wall for the second time after his right front tire blew on lap 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without speaking to reporters.
His team manager Chad Johnston said his 14-man team was disappointed, but now focused on the race coming up next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better use and a better result for him", Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond, hoping we can do better there.
Stewart had previously raced on Sunday night after colliding with Kyle Busch and hitting a wall, and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
'I went into today with a lot of hope for a good result,' said Johnston, adding 'it just didn't work out.'
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tugboat and the team was packed and ready to leave.
Stewart was forced to retire from three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car struck and killed another driver at a cinder-trail race in upstate New York.
He decided to come back this week and win either in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to win a spot in the chase.
He returned to his job while an investigation is being conducted into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who stepped onto the track during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities said Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two more weeks.
No decision has been made yet on whether Stewart will face charges.
The three-time champion was greeted with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After starting from 12th position, Stewart was soon in the top 10 and was temporarily fourth.
After a restart on lap 122, Buschs
Car 18 out of control at the exit of turn two and collided with Stewart, both cars hitting the wall.
Stewart continued, but dropped to 21st.
Dancing-loving offspring sought
Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to seeing their comrades.
Like many other associations, the jazz groups in TV are also committed to providing full-time instruction in secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have become very divided.
Now more youngsters are being sought out for a sport that is healthy and that is great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the eight- to 12-year-old group, six in the 12- to 15-year-old group", says the 20-year-old.
With more assets, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies", she says.
If you fancy dancing, you can join the training session on Thursdays between 5 and 6 p.m. or on Fridays between 5 and 6:30 p.m. in the dance gym at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without obligation.
"The training regularly begins with a warm-up program", says the trainer.
After that, various choreographies are rehearsed.
Jazzdance has the characteristic that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical music to sports and acrobatics are incorporated into jazz dance.
Of course, there is plenty of socializing to do.
"We eat together, watch dance movies, and have stayed in the dance hall", says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group, you can make friends, share a wonderful hobby and do a whole lot for your own motor development.
If you don't like jazz dancing, you can also try one of the other TV Jahn programs.
The children and young people can always sneak into the classroom on Wednesdays in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance instructor is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance on Monday and Wednesday nights.
Anyone who wants to hear discofox, slow waltz, Viennese waltz, rumba, cha-cha-cha and tango, can come and join in.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest outside the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration they reiterated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which had recently been changed.
Also, higher salaries are on a list of demands to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
The workers have been protesting for a month against the new working hours and demanding a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite meetings between the prison workers' union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations are ongoing, the Director General for the Implementation of Penal Measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told BNR.
The prison workers' protest is expected to be supported by members of the Union of Employees of the Ministry of Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters are on the march.
After heavy fighting, allegedly involving Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army abandoned the rebel stronghold Luhansk airport today, Monday.
The army also said that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top military leadership, without giving details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down a plane
In their fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have again shot down a combat aircraft and two military helicopters, according to their own account.
About 100 soldiers were also wounded or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the rebels said on Monday, according to Russian agencies.
Coast Guard ships sunk by German submarines
The rebels also claimed to have sunk two Ukrainian coast guard boats in the Sea of Azov for the first time.
Ukrainian border guards confirmed that two of their ships were hit by shelling near the port city of Mariupol on Sunday.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told the 112.ua channel.
Two crew members were missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported taking control of several settlements in the Donetsk region.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The contact group on Ukraine is meeting today in Minsk, the capital of Belarus.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine was also to take part.
In the run-up to the event, all the actors used their appearances to publicise their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia by planning to deploy troops in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
The European Union is also calling on the European Union to take action to help the victims of the tragedy in the Balkans.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a blatant breach" of the agreement.
'Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner,' said Rasmussen.
Documents and statements from the Russian side indicate that "they consider us as an adversary".
Increased NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he intends to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
The EU's new strategy for the Middle East, which is to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales, will ensure that 'we will have more visible NATO presence in the East for as long as it is needed', Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree to new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed to renew talks to resolve their gas dispute, according to official reports.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
The European Union is awaiting a decision on whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Ukraine has not been getting fuel from Russia for weeks because of the dispute over gas prices.
The EU's energy commissioner, Günther Oettinger, had recently mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also cut off gas supplies to Europe.
Europe gets about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks with authority: the toll will come "very clearly"
The Chancellor has now made her position clear.
It's not a free pass for all the complicated details.
The CDU's persistent concerns about the car toll have angered the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken out in favour of the introduction of a car toll after continuing opposition from her CDU party.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be given the task of drafting a new law on the European Union.
However, Merkel has not yet decided on a detailed model.
The black and red government programme referred to 'certain parameters'.
The German Minister for Transport, Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), said that "a proposal has been made and is now being worked on".
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on its rejection of a toll on all roads.
The Commission is proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee.
He also said that he had discussed with Dobrindt other ways of mobilising more private capital for infrastructure investments, including broadband.
"There's nothing special about it". Schäuble had left a "Spiegel" report on Sunday uncommented, his house was considering a concept of its own to reward motorway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU leader Horst Seehofer warned against developing bribery schemes against the leading minister in the cabinet.
The CDU Vice-President Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed that all the regional and federal roads would be built", said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU state chairman.
The Commission is also proposing that the Council should adopt a new directive on the protection of the financial interests of the European Union.
The CDU-Länder federations of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate also oppose the plans.
The background is fears that a toll would affect small border traffic to neighboring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition allegiance from the ranks of the CDU because of the criticism of Maut.
The Left sees the plans as a failure in view of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks-Maut is dead", said party leader Bernd Riexinger to the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"The Minister is failing with the toll". Dobrindt wants to introduce a mandatory vignette on all German roads starting in 2016.
However, the coalition agreement does not allow for any additional burden on domestic car owners.
The Commission has already taken the initiative in this respect.
The model may not, however, discriminate against foreign drivers on the basis of their nationality, as required by EU law.
Genetic Disorders Often Misdiagnosed by the Medical Profession
One British woman says that because of years of misdiagnosis, she thought she was going to die.
Karin Rodgers lived most of her youth believing that she had only a few years left to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about the disease.
Some 23,000 people in Britain are thought to suffer from CMT, which can cause motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsteady gait, and crooked toes.
People with the disease also experience numbness or pain, and the disease is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms tend to worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she had Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor survival chances.
Rodgers thought she'd be in a wheelchair before she turned 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two, now 51 years old, said: "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same things as others.
I kept falling down and everything took longer.
I could never skate with the other kids, and I was often teased at school for my walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she looked at her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she had FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Society", she said.
When I received the answer, I was shocked and panicked terribly.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by the time I was 18 and I'd die by the time I was 25, and in between, I'd slowly lose all my abilities.
I was dealing with this all by myself, planning my own funeral.
She said that when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities hadn't declined as much as she had imagined, and she consulted her doctor.
He just stood up, and he hugged me and he said, "My love, I don't think you have this, or you'd be in a wheelchair by now".
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic testing, she was found to have CMT.
"When he explained CMT to me, I felt like a winner", she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of this disease.
Staff Sergeant Berni Diether has been working as a firefighter since the closure of the former military training ground
For almost ten years, the former military training ground in Münsingen has been closed to gunfire.
Yet, deadly munitions are still being dropped every month in the heart of the Schwäbische Alb Biosphere.
The grenades are still sometimes so dangerous that they have to be detonated on the spot.
A deafening boom echoes over the heart of the biosphere as explosions occur.
In December 2004, the last live fire was fired at the Münsingen military training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6500 hectare site has been the core of the biosphere area Schwäbische Alb, which is open to walkers and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden on businessmen in the Washington area rises with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax returns for businesses across the country rose slightly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study released last week, and Washington area businesses were no exception.
Businesses in the District, Maryland and Virginia combined paid $27.6 billion to state and local agencies in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent from 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local corporate tax burden rose 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third year of growth in a row after several years of declining business in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the services agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the District's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from corporate taxes.
Virginia has the lowest corporate tax rate at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery in corporate property values, the researchers say, leading to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of this profit came from large states like California, New York and Texas, the same pattern seems to be true for the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012 - a year-over-year increase of 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery in property values is not as effective in raising state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property taxes account for just over one-fifth of corporate tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that a large portion of the real estate, especially in the D.C. tax district, is either owned by the government or by non-profits that don't pay property taxes", said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
For example, Maryland is forced to rely much more heavily on income taxes to provide the same services that other states do.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenue cannot be attributed solely to the recovery in the housing market
Business revenues also appear to be recovering, the data show.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on government organizations of $2.3 billion, compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, local tax burdens on businesses are not increasing equally in all three places.
The District's increase rate was 4.3 percent of the national average, while Maryland's increase was much higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rates in all three jurisdictions at 6%.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the District it is a relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local corporate taxes and a better overall tax climate than Maryland.
The study did not examine the District.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed legislation to lower its corporate tax rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and therefore paying more in state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - a transitional structure by which most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a much faster growth rate than corporate taxes as a whole.
The researchers say the trend and rise in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with overall surplus tax revenue for state and local governments increasing by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Yet the Washington area could be left behind if the federal government's spending cuts affect the region's job market.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - a popular combination in China too.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
The partner city of Frankfurt in China is now looking for a brewery and is also hoping for a direct flight link between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - that is the urgent wish of the Chinese officials.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery would settle in our city", said Li Yiwei, the vice party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, this week during a visit to his city by a delegation of the SPD.
The official of the ruling Communist Party of China repeatedly referred to this concern of the 12 million metropolis during the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of China's richest cities, Li warned.
The people would therefore have the purchasing power to buy German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German delegation of politicians, told the host that he would look for a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"Beer doesn't take much: good water, grain and joy of life", he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
Mr. Li was already radiating such joy, he flattered the host.
Then the official from Guangzhou offered a sheep's milk jug - but with red wine served with the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao is a German brewery.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German Purity Law.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice Party Chief Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again", the local politician said with conviction.
"Business between our two cities continues to grow".
Currently, travelers have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the flight connection.
The Vice-Governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire forward in his talks with the Social Democrats.
"That's a very good idea", replied the Sheepdog-Gumbel - the Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
A well-developed partnership
The low-level vice party chief of Guangzhou hopes to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this position.
He took office this year after his predecessor was removed from office over corruption allegations.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian was also forced to leave.
The crackdown on Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the Party and administration, which is being enforced by President Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he was a top official in Fujian, where the carmaker VW is building a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9000 kilometers away, is one of those maintained by both sides, such as a schuler exchange.
Last year marked the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese alliance.
The South China metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as powerful as the whole of Hesse.
The EU is also seeking to increase its foreign trade with the EU to the tune of EUR 250 billion next year, Li said.
Family of Joan Rivers "crosses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was admitted to a New York City hospital three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support", Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're all thumbs up.
Sources say her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after suffering cardiac arrest at an Upper East Side clinic, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep her sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with her condition, which is still described as "serious".
The response came from many quarters, including an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
Cars and vacuum cleaners that are on the market today will be subject to stricter environmental standards in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will be labelled from 1 September, giving buyers a glance at key information such as the energy efficiency of the appliance.
For new cars, higher nitrous oxide values are applicable in the Euro 6 pollutant class.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolding workers: they receive a uniform national minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon is buying Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information had reported Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a host of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion.
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because anyone expected an acquisition of Twitch, but because there was widespread speculation that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it seemed like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion dollars was a done deal, and the collaboration seemed natural as well.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players to post their favorite pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", according to an insider.
The twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of video where connoisseurs give (usually older) games a touch of science fiction, is already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often mentioned when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken somewhat in a boring way, a textbook example of an established tech company buying up a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn't happen, as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at this point is this statement from Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster".
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say they'd rather play sports than watch, it's hard to fathom the attraction that comes from watching others play games instead of taking control of the console.
It's one thing to look over your shoulder at a friend at 3:00 in the morning, as she's creeping through Resident Evil, and it's another to watch a spider get shot 20 times in a row in the head in Call of Duty.
All these games you could be watching right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without any control over your own perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit, the fast-paced runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But unless he's a gaming or comedy virtuoso, his Twitch channel probably isn't that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from this?
It's hard to imagine Twitch being integrated so elegantly into Amazon Instant Video that YouTube could have just swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are being wooed as advertising customers.
As Twitch's chairman, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming", and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - schluck - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the Hüpfburg Castle Garden Festival on Saturday.
The organizers' concept was right.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday night, an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden.
At times the intake had to be stopped.
"That was annoying", said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt and light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
The open air in the Salzwedler Burggarten is supposed to radiate brightness by day and evening through various shows.
Well, the fun comes of its own.
This was evident early on Saturday morning when the first visitors came to the open air.
The organizers had promised a celebration for all generations.
And they did.
Around the stalls on the Burggartenwiese, the inhabitants of Salzwedel, but also guests from the near and far surroundings, had made themselves comfortable.
They watched the first live performances, they kicked the beat, they enjoyed cold drinks - in short, they were relaxed and enjoyed.
And that goes through the generations.
While some were lounging on the beach bar on the white sand, others were enjoying a quarter of wine in the wine shop, the younger generation was reveling in the Hüpfburg, a major attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when children were being made-up, the volunteers were literally busy getting the crowd's attention and putting imaginative creations in the little faces.
The older ones used the kick-off tables or took part in a skateboarding workshop organized by the Goodfoot-Crew of Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 p.m., he began to slam at the visitors, especially families, who were looking for the open and dry.
But this did not diminish the appeal of the festival.
"More people came than expected", said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success all the way".
So there is no reason why we can't have another big party next year.
The European Commission has already announced that it will be launching a new round of negotiations with the United States on the EU's nuclear programme.
He was annoyed that the intake had to be stopped in the meantime.
Apparently, the security company was booked with too few people.
As a result, some who had already paid did not come to the site.
The resonance was very good.
In an initial conservative estimate, the Salzwedler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were flocking to the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound system.
The Salzwedeler hip-hop band Blocks ∀n ∀Rox broke off their appearance because of this.
The engineers were unable to create a sound that was even half reasonable.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tire failure.
"But next year they will be there", said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful in terms of attendance.
And that's in bad weather.
However, the organisers made some mistakes which will be forgiven the first time but will have to be corrected in the second edition.
The organizers also have to criticize the social network Facebook.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you were expecting more", says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"You've been a little too much", says El Zimmermann at the same time.
Others see the initial problems less narrowly.
I think it's great that some people don't just talk nonsense, but actually try to do something.
Hat off!", writes Stephanie Jens to Amula.
The organisers now have one year to remove these criticisms.
New radom in Berkum: the importance of the Wachtberg landmark is decreasing
It's not what you'd expect.
Rather, it is the ready-made component waiting to be incorporated into the striking structure.
The action is part of a larger initiative: almost 50 years after the launch of the TIRA space observation radar, the shell, called the radome, is being completely renewed.
The new radome will be slightly smaller than the old one, with a diameter of 47.5 metres.
But the size is still a world record.
The final step in completing the new shell is the cap exchange .
The top quarter of the old casing is cut off and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is put on.
If the weather is right, the action will take place at the beginning of this week.
Ice-Bucket Challenge contestant has a sprained ankle
Isabelle Roberts, from the United Kingdom, cried so loudly when ice-cold water was poured over her head that it broke the bone structure of her face.
That Ice Bucket Challenge was a painful failure.
A woman was hospitalized after screaming so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she tore her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts, from Great Britain, screamed so much when ice-cold water was poured over her head that it injured the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I was doing that, my jaw just stopped", she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, the jaw was chapped, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this and almost got in their pants laughing, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was admitted to hospital to have her jaw re-dugged after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip became an internet sensation and was linked thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the castle clubs going to be on the same page soon?
There was always a dispute between the two Wolfratshauser Burg clubs.
Now the board is considering a possible collaboration.
The late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in Guédelon, France, as the model for the reconstruction of Wolfratshauser Burg.
A year ago, the situation between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen was not good.
The views on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction have been very different.
The two camps are now moving towards each other: talks on a joint approach are to be held soon.
This was confirmed by the club's chairmen, Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde), on request from our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down together", Sjöberg says.
He believes that all members of both clubs could be brought together again in the future.
This would make visible successes faster.
While the castle friends of the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had until recently been focusing on the reconstruction of the castle at the Bergwald, the "development and experience" of the grounds is paramount for the Burgverein around Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, Vice-President of the Friends of the Castle, said he was very pleased to receive the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he's been in charge of the friends of the castle.
A new chairman is to be chosen at a general meeting in mid-September.
The 74-year-old says the association currently has about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have suspended the activities of the club out of respect for the time being".
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the friends of the castle could also make a current mood picture within their grouping.
The Commission has already announced that it will be presenting a report on the implementation of the new financial framework for the European Union.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself". He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer would like to continue to work on the project "but very much".
The different views on reconstruction will probably continue to exist in the near future, in Piffl's view.
He credits Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in rebuilding the castle.
Two similar, already well advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a windfall.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the programme to include the following areas:
Piffl: "I was skeptical at first.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to continue the project".
There's nothing else around here.
The project could also be funded by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard". He hopes that the Castle Association might move a little on this point.
Their goal of documenting history first "is important and good".
After that, you could look further.
Clever ways to save money on college textbooks
Since the cost of college textbooks for many students is over $1,000 a year, nearly two-year student Matt Schroeder came up with a clever savings idea.
He invented a lending system for books from upper-class students and offered a nominal fee to delay resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A cookie", said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books he needed for the last semester cost him $430.
He spent $120.
College administrators reported that students spend an average of more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and course materials, but that there are various cost-cutting options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
The rental of textbooks is becoming more popular, and students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly lower price than buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, reported that renting textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Industry surveys show that about a quarter of books in college bookstores were rented last spring, said Tevor Meyer, vice president of Neebos.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one-time thing for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books online are only one-third the price they are at the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be purchased from the specialty textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don't mind other people's notes or the usual use of a book, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business".
The book was sold new for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students ask their professors if previous publications are admissible.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar papers.
In such cases, older issues can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc.'s Half.com is a popular alternative for used books.
Rented
Renting textbooks is a good idea if you take care of them reasonably well, remember to return them and do not want to keep them after the course is over.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent Calculus for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Check the terms of the shop you are renting from, including any penalty fees for writing notes, underlining or using marks.
Attention tenants: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may exceed the price of a new book.
Other
E-books are also an option instead of conventional textbooks.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a specified period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg has a six-month rental on Calculus for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals, since many classics can be downloaded for free nowadays, while science and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look around, anyway.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing books, as it gives you the certainty of finding the right textbook.
And before ordering online, Gault says, you should check to see if the book is actually in stock.
He learned that lesson the hard way.
He bought a book that had a four-week delivery and finally paid the full price at the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" was not a box office hit
Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables 3 grossed less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the U.S., while Sin City: A Dame to Kill For grossed only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz-edited Sex Tape grossed just $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children's films like "Taming the Dragon 2" also disappointed at the box office.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films themselves may be the cause of the children's films.
Collin called 2014 "the worst year" for children's films to date and described "Dragon Teeth Made Easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, with regard to films for a slightly older audience, the quality of the films does not seem to be the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for every summer film release that was shown on at least 2,000 screens between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema-goers and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equal to those of the previous year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's upcoming Jungle Book film, told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times are changing".
We must accept that and not try to run after the past.
In contrast to the current lackluster box office performance of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently reported $1.2 billion in streaming revenue, almost double the $837 million it earned last year.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the movie studios for focusing too much on adapting comic books and predicted a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the present downturn, some commentators argue that his grim prophecy may well have a true kernel.
However, other industry representatives are more optimistic about the potential box office successes that are expected to hit the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World:
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in box office results as simply "cyclical", telling the Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest summer ever at the box office, and nobody will have to worry about business anymore".
When the 2nd table tennis district was abolished a few years ago to streamline the league classification, it was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Association has added a third league to its program.
The consequence: if you haven't gone up, you've gone down.
Göttingen's top-ranked team Torpedo has avoided relegation in the Oberliga, but will only play in fifth-class in the coming season.
Torpedos Ladies remain fourth, despite their spectacular breakthrough into the regional league.
The Torpedo boys and girls start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
SG Lenglern and Torpedo-Reserve play in the new Verbandsliga, in the Landesliga there are no more Göttingen clubs represented.
The women's team plays in the Verbandsliga, the Torpedo-second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new district superleague south.
The club's home ground is the Stade de France, which is home to the club's reserve team, TSV Seulingen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC.
In the district league, regional representatives Dransfeld and SC Weende play, in the district class TTC II, Rot-Weiß, Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The district league of the ladies starts at least in the target strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the game.
The district league is contested by Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen.
With nine teams each
SC Weende sends its girls to the district league.
The district league season of the SCW boys - where Torpedo II starts - is not complete either.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV are entering the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen district leagues start with nine teams each.
The West Squadron is made up of Red and White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
The East Division includes the clubs of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The women's league is made up of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
That's still better than the Osterode circuit, where there are no women's teams at the circuit level anymore.
Strikingly, none of the six secondary school classes reaches the target strength, so the innovative and resourceful district board will have to think about this.
NATO summit: first protests in Newport and Cardiff
There were protests this weekend by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the centre of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff at the town hall to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments for us this weekend and has spoken to protesters who travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flown out of the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bushwalkers were taken to safety by ropewind after being trapped in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales overnight.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set off for their tour of Govetts Leap in Blackheath shortly after noon on Sunday.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search party from local police and rescue services broke out and the couple were found at about 11pm near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and hit his head.
Rescue workers stayed with the couple overnight and were flown out Monday morning.
You were taken to Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable condition in an ambulance.
Anti-government protests in Pakistan escalate
The approximately 1,000 protesters were forced out of the PTV building by soldiers, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The station resumed broadcasting after about a half-hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the protesters armed with sticks damaged equipment in the newsroom.
No reports of casualties or injuries.
The protesters are demanding the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said that around 3,000 protesters clashed with security forces on Monday, about a kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Hospital reports indicate that a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured as protesters tried to storm Sharif's residence over the weekend.
They are calling for the Prime Minister's resignation.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and without using force" after a meeting at army headquarters on Sunday evening.
The statement continued: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state".
The escalating violence has raised concerns about military intervention, which has been the subject of more coups in the past.
The protests, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri, have been going on since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to persevere.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign", Khan said.
Qadri said something similar.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary elections last May by fraud.
Qadri demands the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is to reform the electoral system and call new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government quarter.
The protesters had initially held out peacefully outside Parliament until Khan and Qadri called them to break into Sharif's residence over the weekend.
Hütteldorfer is third in the standings after their second win of the season.
With the 2-0 victory over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday came to a peaceful end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating", said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached the second round with the Europa League exit on Thursday.
"The experience of success was incredibly important", confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who led with green and white on third place.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid on the road to victory Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second win of the season and goes into the international break with a success.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction", said fullback Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory with his magnificent lead volley from the 16th corner in the 14th minute.
"I thought I'd take all the frustration from Thursday and put it under the bar", the 26-year-old said with a smile.
When Schrammel on November 13, 2010 had hit for the last time in a Bundesliga game, that was still for Ried.
The first championship goal scorer in the Rapid suit will therefore be remembered in a special way.
"This is something very special for me, since I am from the Rapid Generation", said Schrammel.
Due to the short-term pelvis blow by Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did his thing very well there too.
He's experienced enough to be able to hold that position in a cross-examination.
He's earned the goal, he's already made some assists this year", Barisic said.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after more than an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written.
"Thank God we had some luck today", said Schrammel, alluding to the split between performance and result in the past weeks: "The results were not the same, but the game was always good compared to last year".
Barisic even said that "in many games before, you were better than today" - against "the strongest team that played in this stadium this season".
The first three-point win since July 26 proved that the team structure was intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team showed that they have character".
He was just as happy to say, "We've finally played to a draw again".
A lot of work during the break also made the victory more valuable, as Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger were all out for several matches and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their debuts.
"We must not forget that", warned Barisic, who has lost in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately".
The international break should be used to "lick wounds and put on a bit of weight in the physical area", explained Barisic, who has five U21 selectors in his squad.
One who may need a break is Captain Hofmann.
He's doing his best for the team, he's over the pain.
It was in this difficult phase that he showed that he is a very important player for us", Barisic said.
Hofmann not only gave the game to Rapids before his substitution in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first goal from the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 over Admira).
"We must not think that everything is fine now". "We have had a little luck, but eventually the luck must come back to us.
It was high time", said Hofmann.
He did, however, urge a focused approach: "You can't always see it in black and white.
We have not played as badly as has been portrayed in the last few weeks.
But we must not think that everything is fine now.
He couldn't deny the importance of his role on the team.
It's a very young team, and I can help them a lot right now.
They are sticking to me at certain stages", said Hofmann.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to reproach himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter-hit "from the category of magic goal", as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly denied by referee Kollegger.
The only criticism I can make of the team is that we were not specific enough in some phases towards the goal.
We didn't have enough degrees.
In the same way, the centre-back Maximilian Karner said: "It started badly, but then we found the inside and even scored a goal.
It would have been more, on the whole.
Under this peak, there is calm
We showed a powerful tribe in our riddle problem of the summer series "My Piece of Rhône Happiness" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the county, the pictured specimen is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak tree.
It passes through clusters of basalt and basalt-rich seas.
A little bit below the quarry of the Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it is.
The natural monument is vital in appearance, towering over the other trees in the area and resembling an American mammoth tree, with a circumference of over twenty feet [8 m].
A small Buddha on a tree trunk suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, all we could find was clues to the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheim archives and interviewed elderly people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what kind of familiarity it has with the Geissruhe.
The result of his investigations was a rather sober explanation for the name.
According to this, up until about 80 years ago, goat herders would have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the hard-rooted and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the animal keepers, exhausted from climbing, are said to have rested.
The area has now regained its importance, as the meadows are actually grazing goat herds again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider found.
But be careful when entering the rock formations, for the sun-warmed basalt is also a popular place for the common rock-wild parrot.
A path leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Other routes are marked, leading up to Hochrhön and inviting you to a long hike.
Where's the water tower?
However, a water castle, which is sought in our next task, is rather rare in the heights.
The reflection in the trench gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district to which the building contour could fit.

After weeks of wrangling, Italy's Prime Minister and incumbent EU President, Matteo Renzi, overcame strong conservative opposition at the EU's extraordinary summit last week to win the nomination of his foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, as EU foreign policy chief, to succeed British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers the appointment of Mogherini, who is also the government's favourite, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU, as reported by the pro-government daily La Repubblica.
He also expects it to give a boost to his "reform package" in Italy.
The European Parliament has voted in favour of the report, which calls for the Commission to be given a more active role in the fight against terrorism.
The Commission is also proposing a new regulation on the protection of the environment and the environment from harmful substances.
The EU's chief diplomat will also become Commission President Juncker's deputy.
The pending approval of the EU Parliament is considered secure.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old ruling Democratic Party (PD) politician an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is optimistic that Mogherini, who has been in leading party positions for almost two decades and is known for her ambition, will be able to face "enormous challenges".
The native Romanian is married and has two daughters.
She graduated in political science in 1996 and started her career in the youth organization of the Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged with the Catholic Centre Party Margherita in 2008 to become the Social Democratic Party.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (ECOSO) for three years.
With the election in 2001 to the party council of the Left Democrats, she entered the high party politics, worked in the department of foreign policy, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional focal points of Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, became known through studies of the NATO operation in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, and used to maintain contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the USA.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD has a better relationship today with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party's over 40 percent vote in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The new EU foreign policy envoy has too little diplomatic experience, so lacks substance, is countered in the PD.
In Brussels, particularly by Poland and the Baltic members, the realist accents of Mogherini on the crisis in Ukraine are being followed with suspicion and are being denigrated as a 'Russian-friendly course'.
It supports the South Stream pipeline, operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to transport Russian natural gas directly to southern Europe bypassing Ukraine, which also serves Italy's energy security.
After Renzi began his term as EU president in July, Mogherini made her first state visit to Moscow.
Photos of them shaking hands with Putin were met with outrage in Brussels, as was their invitation to the Kremlin leader to an October economic summit in Milan.
Nine young people in total started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes an apprentice who has previously completed another form of training in the company.
The new employees will be employed in four occupations: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All the apprentices are from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vor Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees had previously attended primary and secondary schools and primary schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all grades and the instructors go to a team building event in Oberammergau, where the program includes a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn.
The company employs 435 people in Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of trainees in all years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "shut up and put France in order", said Francois Hollande's main ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show 'their love' for the controversial socialist president whose cabinet reshuffle has been met with disapproval by the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stand by him", he said to great applause.
In a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not challenge the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite strong calls for relaxation by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his fellow Socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Justice Minister Christiane Taubira threw sand into the wind, appearing at a meeting of dissident Socialist MPs and criticizing the Socialist Party for "taking the faith of the French people in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists' constant pit fights and said she could not imagine the new Valls government lasting more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the Emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has none either, they are forced to form a new government when the old one has not survived a summer.
"And the new one will not survive the autumn or the winter either", Ms Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament and said she was confident of emerging as the winner in the early elections and was ready for government.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front led in the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party is in danger of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's term in office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion needs to feel that things are changing quickly", he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could worsen.
Norwegian Cruise is on the verge of a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise operator, is in advanced negotiations to acquire competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships and its wealthy clientele while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
A deal could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that talks could also end in failure.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations are not open to the public.
Representatives from Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesperson for Apollo declined to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, up 6 percent from the previous year.
The cruise industry as a whole is worth about $29 billion and is expected to grow in the next few years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise providers for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises filed for an IPO with US regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise company owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, according to regulatory authorities, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82% of the passenger capacity on American cruise ships, according to the initial filing documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A group of Beijing loyalists waved the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law on Sunday that allows only two or three candidates to run in Hong Kong's leadership election in 2017.
All candidates must first secure the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be composed of Beijing-loyal members.
The decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote and has prompted pro-democracy activists to carry out their threat to paralyze Hong Kong's financial center with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform has long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China's party leadership fears that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper in June that laid out China's dominance over Hong Kong, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the special administrative region, with hundreds of thousands marching into the city's business district and organizing a sit-in.
The interview with Lis is organized by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee's Legal Affairs Commission, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Feng Wei, were to be questioned later in the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather outside the Hong Kong leadership office this afternoon.
Britain did not have any democratic elements in Hong Kong until the final phase of its 150-year colonial rule.
Putin demands that Kiev hold "statehood talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region, according to Russian media reports.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled area of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that his status vis-à-vis Ukraine needed to be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call for the Kiev government to negotiate on equal footing with the pro-Russian rebels, however, fits the strategy he has apparently pursued since the unrest began five months ago: helping the separatists take territory and pressuring the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with state-run Channel One television, Putin condemned Ukraine's military campaign to retake separatist-held areas in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently dubbed the territory they have captured "Novorossiya" or "Neurussia", a term that evokes the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who hope for peace talks in the wake of Ukrainian politicians' campaigns for the October 26 elections and government groups attacking civilian communities in separatist-held areas are "trapped in their illusions", Itar-Tass reported.
"We must immediately start detailed talks, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there", he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood should be seen in the context of the greater autonomy discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
The issue is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine".
The clarification by the Kremlin spokesman to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's claim of leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of its 6.5 million inhabitants are non-Russians and pre-conflict polls showed a large majority in favor of remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy, which has been raised by Russian diplomats at international forums, would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects Russian territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to much of the Russian navy, as well as a major commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries producing key components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his inaugural speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers should consider adding to the constitution, after new elections, amendments that would give the regions greater control over their finances and the status of their languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose arming and inciting is blamed on Moscow.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing follows a further rebel advance last week, after Russian troops and tanks crossed into eastern Ukraine via the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
The Russian-backed separatists have taken control of Novoasovsk in a surprise move that Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region as far as Crimea.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been launched to fortify Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants, situated between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are close to the point of no return", warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on specific actions, the leadership requested the drafting of further sanctions against Russia, which are to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian troops were forced to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, said in a report in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of what are believed to be 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped in Ilovaisk by the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrity and Gabi Grecko nude photo scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has made no secret of his anger over hackers who allegedly stole nude photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who's who of Hollywood A-listers.
Film City is in turmoil after a series of explicit photos of a nude Jennifer Lawrence surfaced in a celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker responsible for the hack is believed to have 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star of "Tribute to Panem", and superstars including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were also reportedly exposed to private photos due to an iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who got engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential, "It's disgusting".
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It's a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently based in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was "shameful" and that those affected "feel hurt".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two of her lying topless in a pool.
Among Palmer's film credits is "Love is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were unavailable for comment on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative for Lawrence told TMZ, "It's a gross violation of privacy".
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked pictures from a phone is nothing less than selling fake goods".
Legally speaking, the redistribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers took part in the 8th cycle on the Great Field Mountain yesterday, supporting the association "Help for Children with Cancer".
The tour, which was torture for some, was a light workout for others.
But one thing they all agreed on: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have had a good night's sleep.
For the first time in his life, the head of Oberurseler Brewery rode his bike on Feldberg yesterday.
For the good cause.
He can easily hide the little muscle cat, especially since his participation in the 8th cycling on the Great Field Mountain for the Association "Help for Children with Cancer" (Frankfurt) also brought him a valuable insight.
That's a great thing.
"I know I can do this now - great!"
A little pause on the way to the applause?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is a CDU member of the Oberursel city council, many of the 718 participants were making a hard effort to climb the mountains yesterday in the early morning dew and arrived on the plateau almost exhausted but happy.
Others, however, found it easier to cover the seven-mile [11 km] distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
The Normans, for example.
The Green politician from the district council, who was dressed in red - red dress, red bike - made a slight understatement at the start ("A lot of professionals, here is the goal!"), but then proved to be half a professional on the mountain and after 45 minutes went through the finish without breathing.
He too had run the route in a slide, as had Nina Kuhn, the press spokeswoman for the city of Oberursel, who had started along with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Bike" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to be involved - we would have made a trip today anyway", says Kuhn.
On the way, they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had driven down to Oberursel in the morning to start again on the hill.
The Frankfurt resident Florian Zierz had gotten into his saddle at 9 a.m. at home, "made" the Feldberg twice, then rolled home with fun.
I had fun with "Fritten-Toni".
For the head of the Oberursel cultural kiosk, bike rides over the Feldberg are just part of the job.
He had been on his two-pound racing bike for 40 minutes.
It was a crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be involved", said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainz says he is an "ambitious racing cyclist".
He must be, because he was riding the "Fixie-Wheel", which is a racing bike, but without a gearbox...
The fact that it was possible to climb without a wheel was proved not only by the 20 hikers who climbed the White Wall and the Fox Dance to the summit, but also by a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights on a rope.
The mountain-watch doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who was with his team, equipped with all-wheel-bullys and quads, to ensure safety, said: "I know him from Frankfurt, who is trained for a special sled track, only that he pulls the sled himself".
The 718 participants - the largest number ever - had been sent out in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9:30.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers left.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Riding on the Big Field Mountain", gave the start commands and wished the participants a pleasant trip.
For next year, he hopes to be able to close the route up the Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
