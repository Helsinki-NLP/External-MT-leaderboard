Rapid increase in cumulative cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends across the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom which confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries, although at different stages depending on the country.
Based on the knowledge gained from Italy, the country, hospitals and intensive care units need to increase preparation for the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients who will require healthcare and especially intensive care.
A case of pneumonia of unknown prognosis was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 31 December 2019.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention stated that the novel coronavirus is now referred to as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the active ingredient.
Therefore, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
The data to date is that 80% of people infected with COVID-19 have mild illness, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia and most of them recover.
Of the 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more serious illness that creates a need for hospitalization, while 6% of cases develop a serious illness that requires intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is around 4%.
In this study, we are reviewing the trend of cumulative cases of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom (UK) and comparing them to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the numbers in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020 with the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
China is lagging behind as COVID-19 spreads more geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in the rest of the world currently follow that country.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
In the March 5th issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri and colleagues reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases as defined by the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases among people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China were reported by France on 24 January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) had COVID-19 cases, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported as of 31 December 2019, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Accumulative number of COVID-19 cases and accumulated prevalence
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) only reports the number of COVID-19 cases counted in each country worldwide, obtained from official sources such as the Ministries of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, which is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare it to what happened in Italy.
As a proxy for the outbreak of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day short incremental cases of COVID-19, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each country in the EU/EEA and the UK during the period 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative numbers of cases reported in each country as on 15th March 2020 at 8:00 am and compare them with the cases in Italy for the period 31st January-15th March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trends in the 14-day short-term increasing cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed the trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, cumulative cases of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (supplementary material).
This was mainly driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar trend of increasing cumulative cases of COVID-19 increases (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows a comparison of the numbers in Italy with the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
It is noteworthy that as of 8:00 am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have already reported a total of cases comparable to Italy's just 3 weeks ago or less.
Our findings indicate that the number of known cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trend in the accumulated cases of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is moving at a comparative pace in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, national public health responses varying, and countries having different definitions of likely cases and different protocols for classifying patients who must be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described a situation where 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or an intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, these should be systematically collected to complement the current surveillance data which focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010/11 in a pattern of 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Germany from 29.2 in Portugal showed a large difference between the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe.
This means countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 in 2010/11).
With the prevalence of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital in each EU/EEA country and the UK, modelling of the healthcare capacity correlation situation showed that there is a > 90% risk of overcapacity of intensive care beds and this is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid COVID-19 Risk Assessment.
As cases are still clustered across EU/EEA countries and some regions of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically provide a specific regional service to the population, it is recommended that data on cases and intensive care beds be available in the regional unit naming system for the statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare themselves for the ongoing community transmission situation of SARS-CoV-2 and the increased number of COVID-19 cases that require healthcare and especially intensive care, as occurred in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2 infection is essential, with a shift from suppression to mitigation approach, as if not implemented early, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, adapt and tailor their response accordingly.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity when countries are likely to further increase their containment efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare.
Failing to do so, it is likely that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a surge in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 infections in China and the rest of the world, bringing a disaster to mankind.
SARS-CoV is similar to its cousin virus, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from bats and cause the same symptoms by the same method.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more contagious and affects older men than younger people and women more than men.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, etology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, disease motility and prevention of the disease.
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review will help to understand and eradicate the dreaded disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were told to stay indoors throughout the holiday and for weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); thus, on February 11, 2020, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the associated disease was named CoV disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the country and to 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 due to the virus, of which over 40,000 patients have been discharged and over 3,000 patients have died.
"WHO warns that COVID-19 is ""the number one enemy of the people"" and is probably more powerful than terrorism".
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), less than two months after first reporting on 7 January 2020, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 including virus, epidemiology, etology, diagnosis and treatment have been published that have sequenced viruses isolated from multiple patients.
The review seeks to summarise the progress of research in this new and rapidly developing field.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-caused disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, pandemic in 2012).
We discussed what we know so far about disease prevention and prediction, as well as some outstanding but pressing questions.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens in humans, causing about 15% of the 4 common cold cases.
However, in this century, we have encountered two highly pathogenic human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which started an epidemic in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively, and which soon spread to many other countries with devastating symptoms and deaths.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the pneumonia clusters that were of unknown origin were first reported from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was released.
The first fatal incident in Wuhan was reported on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, healthcare providers were informed of the infection, indicating that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, Wuhan was locked down and all public transportation was suspended.
The first diagnostic study of the disease on 24 January said that only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is considered the source of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of this report, the disease has already spread to China and about 50 other countries around the world (Figure (Figure 2).2).
The final extent and severity of the outbreak is yet to be determined as the situation is rapidly escalating.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study on 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients presented the following more updated epidemiological picture (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but has been found mainly in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age and only 14 infected persons were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread rapidly, mainly in Hubei and its surroundings.
On average, it takes 5 (2-9) days from onset of COVID-19 to diagnosis.
The average incubation period of the pathogen was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The initial reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people rose rapidly before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the mass transit period before the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate among confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the composite mortality rate among all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subclass of large and coiled viruses that contain a single-stranded formula of sensing RNA.
They can be divided into four classes or genera, namely, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta CoVs are known to infect humans.
The wrapping keyhole (S) glycoprotein for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV binds to its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidial peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively, and subsequently membrane binding occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the envelope forms a vesicle or vesicle with the genomic RNA virin-bound with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which then fuses with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new type of beta-CoV with over 99.98% genetic identification in 10 sequential samples collected from the Hunan Seafood Market in Wuhan, the original site of the outbreak.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 has much more similarity to SARS-CoV than MES-CoV.
Through pressure electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the ultrasonic portion of the human respiratory epithelium.
It was found that human ACE2 was a receptor in human SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 bind to human ACE2 relatively more weakly than those of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 forms a novel small protein encoded by orf3b and can also produce a protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2's orf3b may play a role in its ability to cause viral disease and in inhibiting the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 has no known functional domains or patterns.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution in mixed material with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the open and closed-adapted composite was combined as a dimer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 composite could bind to two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and transmission of CoVs.
For reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug trials.
Primary and intermediate nutrients
It is reported that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through civet cats and camels respectively.
By a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered to be the natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs derived from bats, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate nutrient helped the virus to overcome the species barrier to infect humans, and the transmission pathway has yet to be explained in detail.
Ji et al. presented the snake as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans that is involved in the recombination of homologues in S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China indicated that 99% of the CoVs discovered among long-beaked pangolins, ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine - SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins - are potential intermediates for SARS-CoV-2 based on genetic homology.
However, the 1% difference spread across the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, conclusive results for a strong proof are still awaited (Fig. (Fig.33)).
The psycho-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive outside the body in a dry environment for up to 48 hours and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and humidity levels of 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat for 30 minutes at 56 °C; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated disinfectants, parasitic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents other than chlorohexidine can effectively inactivate the virus.
The entire human race is generally immunocompromised to SARS-CoV-2, and therefore at risk of infection by the novel virus.
There are currently no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only look at previous studies on other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig. 4).4).
Typically, after a virus enters the host, it is first identified by the host's innate immune system through pattern-marking receptors. These receptors include C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
Through a variety of pathways, the virus induces the release of inflammatory agents, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit viral transmission and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus survive the immune system response.
Soon, the adapted immune response also joined the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in immunity.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the immune cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell death.
The body's immune system, including supplements like C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients inhibit MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, hypersensitivity of the immune system produces locally large numbers of free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and in the worst case, multi-organ disability and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a rash onset, is more likely to affect older people with pre-existing conditions and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to large numbers of viruses or who have weakened immune systems to be more likely to become infected than others.
Based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with most cases lasting 3-7 days.
However, the study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period of the disease virus was on average 3 days and the range was from 0 to 24 days.
As described above, a very recent study showed that the incubation period of the pathogen was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a population of 8,866 cases.
It is important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine period based on the most accurate pathogenic incubation period, thus preventing transmission of the virus from infected but asymptomatic people to others.
As a general rule, people infected or in contact with the virus are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Is it necessary to extend the quarantine period to 24 days?
In most cases, fever is the main and primary symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, drowsiness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, vomiting and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea (shortness of breath) and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever need to be tested for the virus in the early diagnosis even if there are no pulmonary imaging abnormalities.
A demographic survey in late December 2019 found that 98% of the percentage of symptoms were fever, 76% were dry cough, 55% were dyspnea and 3% had diarrhoea; 8% of patients required ventilation assistance.
Two recent studies of a class of clots (family cluster) and a cluster caused by infection from an asymptomatic person were reported to have similar findings.
By comparison, a 2012 demographic study found that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% of them required ventilation support, which is much higher than COVID-19 patients and is consistent with higher mortality of MERS than COVID-19.
MERS patients also had diarrhea (26%) and sore throats (21%)
Among SARS patients, it was shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13) -25%) were the main symptoms, and about 14%-20% of patients required ventilation assistance.
By 14 February, the global COVID-19 death rate was 2% while the confirmed cases reached 66,576.
By comparison, SARS had a mortality rate of 8,096 as of November 2002, 10% of confirmed cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases based on a demographic survey in June 2012.
An earlier study reported that SARS-CoV-2's R0 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, whereas SARS-CoV's R0 was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above numbers indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection has a higher potential to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the other two.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is more challenging than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Cluster onset often occurs in the same family or from the same group or vehicle, such as a sea vessel.
Most cases have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other infected areas or contact with an infected person or patients in the last two weeks of developing symptoms.
However, there are reports that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have recovered and been discharged from hospital can carry the virus again, sending a warning to extend the quarantine period.
In the early stages, patients have normal or low numbers of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte count <1 × 109 /L and white blood cell count <4 × 109 /L. For example, lymphopenia and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte count <1 × 109 /L and white blood cell count <4 × 109 /L.
Some patients had increased levels of liver and muscle stimulators and myoglobin in their blood, and most patients had increased C-reactive protein and erythrocyte suppression in their blood.
In severely affected patients, levels of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, increased and lymphocyte counts decreased.
Abnormalities of chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bilateral opacity of the abrasive shadow or rubbery glass in the lungs.
Patients are often diagnosed with asymptomatic pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid deposition and progressive fibrosis severely impair gas exchange.
Abnormal activity of type-I and type-II pneumocytes leads to decreased surfactant levels and increased surface tension, which reduces the lung's ability to dilate and increases the risk of lung failure.
Thus, the worst types of chest radiographic findings are often seen in the most severe cases of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed discovery of pneumocyte decomposition, hyaline membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of the deceased person, which is consistent with viral infection and pathology of ARDS and similar in SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA identification by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the extremely high false-negative rate, which can accelerate the pandemic, from February 13, 2020, in China, clinical or diagnostic publications are beginning to be used for diagnosis (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR).
The same situation has emerged in SARS diagnostics.
Therefore, a linkage of disease history, diagnostic screening, laboratory testing and radiological investigations is essential and essential for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2, which isolates segments of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter per input) using a dipstick in less than one hour without the need for amplification equipment.
It is hoped that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and susceptibility when diagnostic samples are tested.
Due to the lack of experience with novel CoVs, doctors can provide mainly supportive midwifery to COVID-19 patients as well as trying different therapies previously used or recommended to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2).
These therapies include antiviral drugs, immune response suppression, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicines and psychological support for current and potential treatments.
It was even suggested to use plasma from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in competition to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily initially attacks the lungs and also likely attacks other organs that express ACE2 in low doses, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory failure and disability are the major threat and leading cause of death in patients.
Thus, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and is life-saving, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-interruptible ventilation and mechanical ventilation that may be interrupted depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an advanced cardiopulmonary bypass technology used to treat life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
It is also essential to maintain electrolyte balance, prevent and treat indirect infection and septic shock and protect vital organ function in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been reported that cytokine disruption results from immune system overreaction in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine disruption is a form of neurological inflammatory response that occurs through the release of classes of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines pass through the immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which are a major cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Suppression of immune responses is essential in the treatment of cytokine disruption, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tosilzumab, which is an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine disruption.
Other immunosuppressive therapies for cytokine disruption include modification of T cell-directed immune responses; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; inhibitors of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
To reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS.
However, high doses of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the chances of recovery.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses are recommended for discretionary use in severely ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been shown to be effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug, initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlberg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed potential resistance to other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct a pair of trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and the results are highly anticipated.
Baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapies for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions of this treatment with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Production of plasma and antibodies from recovered patients
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients recovering from infectious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy people from contracting the disease.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight germs and other foreign objects and they detect individual molecules of pathogens and directly mitigate them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, and with it reduced inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, specific therapies have not yet been developed and prior verification and clarification are needed to propose approaches for mass use.
Also, in terms of therapeutic effects, some of the difficulties associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate immune responses and cause cytokine release syndrome, a potentially fatal toxicity.
Blood antibody concentrations are generally low, and plasma is in high demand to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce antibodies quickly at a specific stage to fight the global pandemic.
Thus, it is more important and fruitful to isolate B cells from recovering patients and detect the genetic codes to monitor effective antibodies against the necessary proteins of the virus or to encode effective antibodies.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effects largely depend on the combination of multiple ingredients in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis based on TCM-theory.
Most active ingredients are unknown or unclear, as such ingredients or their optimal combinations are difficult to extract and verify.
Currently, in the absence of effective and specific therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or patients recovering from a severe stage.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were reported to be effective in treating COVID-19.
Many Chinese states where TCM was used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients had the highest recovery rates at 87%, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, where TCM was used for only roughly 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rates (13%).
However, this is a rather rough comparison as many other influencing factors such as number of patients and severity should be included in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing combined WM and TCM treatments with Western medicine (WM) treatments.
They found that the time required for body temperature to return to normal, for symptoms to resolve and for hospitalization was significantly shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group.
Most interestingly, the rate of symptomatic deterioration (mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM await further controlled trials on a larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be of interest to identify the working process and if possible, clarify the effective components of TCM treatment or combinations thereof.
Most suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients experience a fear of highly contagious and even life-threatening disease, and those in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, cough and adverse effects of treatment such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia can lead to increased anxiety and depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a variety of psychiatric symptoms were reported, including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory contact tracing and quarantine can create more anxiety and guilt among people about the impact of infection, quarantine and stigmatization of their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and persons who have come in contact with them as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of mental health teams from multiple branches of medicine, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential to prevent the chain of infection from animal reservoirs and infected humans to susceptible pets and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to create long-lasting and strongly inhibitory antibodies against SARS-CoV and/or to create protective immunity.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been tested in animal models of SARS.
However, before a clinical study is started, the bioavailability of these vaccine candidates in elderly people and in life-threatening models and their safety against infection with viruses transmitted from animal sources to humans have not yet been determined.
This is probably because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the presence of zoonotic sources in the affected areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits have been developed, and several have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for people who are not immune is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging due to the long time required (average 18 months) for vaccine development and the dynamic variation of CoV-clusters.
As a novel disease, the full diagnostic course of COVID-19 has just begun to mature for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients with no pre-existing condition can recover gradually.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with much higher morbidity and mortality rates in critically ill patients.
Therefore, it is essential for healthcare agencies to develop a predictive model of this disease to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the diagnostic studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with disease progression in COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the outcome of SARS, as was the case with COVID-19.
In the above-described study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred mainly in the 30-65 age group, with 47.7% of those patients being over 50 years of age.
Patients who required intensive care were also more likely to have other underlying conditions and complications and were significantly older than others (mean age 66 versus mean age 51), indicating age as a disease-specific factor for COVID-19 patient outcomes.
Gender: Men have had higher incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than women (0.31/100,000 vs 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Existence and complications of multiple diseases: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to have severe heart failure and arrhythmias.
Also cardiac events were the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ACE2-positive collagenic cells, which may result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be remembered that age and underlying disease are strongly related and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal data obtained in the laboratory: Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) reflect the severity of inflammation or injury to tissue and have been proposed as possible disease-speed indicators for disease, response to therapy and eventual recovery.
The correlation of severity and predictability of COVID-19 with CRP level was also suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.
These stimulants are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released during cell damage.
So, these are the natural markers for heart or liver failure.
Major diagnostic symptoms: Chest radiography and the chronological progression of diagnostic symptoms should be considered along with other problems to predict the severity and outcome of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjunctive therapy in infectious diseases.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with chronic disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for short periods of time in COVID-19 patients.
Stress: As described above, many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic often endured prolonged quarantines and extreme uncertainty and were subjected to abnormal stress as they saw close family members and fellow patients fall in the face of death.
Psychological counselling and long-term support are essential to help these patients to relieve stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from those of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate on the upper respiratory tract and causes mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs responsible for the common cold.
Thus, patients infected in the early stages or during the pathogenic phase can produce large amounts of virus during their daily work, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV infection was considered to occur when patients became seriously ill, while most infections did not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are currently underway in China, including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of halting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have caused dramatic damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the pandemic.
The most promising forecast is that the outbreak will end by March and the downward phase of the disease will last for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others predicted that COVID-19, which is emerging as more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others established a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat-drawn larvae of patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital 2 weeks ago, indicating that the newly identified virus would have a similar cyclical phase to influenza.
However, there are optimistic signs in China based on the falling number of new cases, which indicate that current strategies may be working.
Ebola was initially predicted to cause one million cases, including half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been brought under control.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become vulnerable to infection and eventually become extinct or coexist with humans in a relatively less transmissible virus.
The comparison of SARS and MERS to the COVID-19 pandemic is shown below (Figure 55)
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing and also possibly through direct contact with material contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in the stool, which highlights the new possibility of fecal-to-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases found that 41% of cases were likely due to nosocomial (hospital-associated) infections, including 17 patients with other pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare providers.
Thus, people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even those who are close to the sick or infected people need to take adequate precautions to protect themselves.
Wearing a mask can be used as a first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection; the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series #1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent small droplets of fluid from a potentially infected person from being dispersed through the air or trapped on the surface of an object, from where they could spread to others.
However, only N95 (series #1860) masks can protect against small viruses such as 10 to 80 nm being absorbed through respiration, with only 5% of viruses being able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can enter even through five consecutive surgical masks, healthcare providers who come in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series#1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear appropriate isolation gowns to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; the virus probably entered his body through his inflamed eye.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face coverings or goggles when working with patients.
For the public in affected or potentially affected areas, everyone is highly advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more frequently than usual, try to stay indoors to quarantine themselves, and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
A distance of three feet is considered to be the appropriate distance to keep from a patient.
These measures are effective in reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came to the human world as a novel virus, China should have taken high precautions based on its deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak due to its high similarity to SARS-CoV, according to a report dated 7 January 2020.
However, until January 19, 2020, the director of Wuhan's Center for Disease Control had reassured citizens that the novel virus was less transmissible and had limited human-to-human reproductive capacity, and that there were no problems in preventing and controlling the disease.
The message significantly eased public fears, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and crucial time was wasted in minimizing the disease in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies can learn from this hard lesson and make necessary improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations need to (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word citizens will consider and it can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unsolicited information received from clinics without waiting for a formal report from doctors or officials; (3) be more controlling in suppressing a potential pandemic at an early stage rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) frequently implement innovative and effective practices aimed at raising public awareness of pandemic diseases and testing and improving society's response mechanisms in phases.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and as of this writing, it has spread to about 50 other countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and has similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a feeling of SARS re-emergence.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are essential for pandemic suppression and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people and men more than women, and the severity and mortality rates are also higher among older people than younger people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus asymptomatically, while SARS patients usually do so in a state of severe illness, making it much more difficult to suppress COVID-19 infection than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 has spread more rapidly and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may also test positive for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several important issues remain to be addressed:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and the two bat SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal was an intermediate species for transmitting the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively slow the spread of infection and the outbreak could return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical evaluations have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter respiratory cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also block ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we cannot have fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically multiplying during human-to-human transmission?
Will it turn into a global pandemic, a SARS-like death, or a recurrence of a flu-like outbreak at some point?
It is essential, but it takes time to answer these and many more questions.
But whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
Animal origins of human coronaviruses
Mutations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have turned the coin upside down to reveal just how devastating and deadly HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought CoVs back to the forefront of discussion, and it surprised us by showing higher transmissibility and lower pathogenicity than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal-borne disease and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs can help us.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are less pathogenic.
Intermediate Aadhaar hosts have also been identified for some HCoV-clusters.
Animal nutrient detection has a direct impact on human immunity.
Investigating CoV-host exchange in animals can also provide important insights into CoV pathogenicity in humans.
In this review, we provide a summary of the existing knowledge about seven HCoVs, focusing on their history of discovery as well as their animal origin and interrelated transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombination.
In this context, the current COVID-19 pandemic was discussed.
In addition, the need for successful sponsor change and the effects of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoV-clusters) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of coated, positive-sensitive, single-stranded RNA viruses.
"Hosting the largest genome of RNA viruses at 26 to 32 kilobases, these viruses were dubbed ""CoV"" because of the crown-like organelles under the electron microscope".
Structurally, CoVs have integral genomes that belong to the same organization.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
The polyproteins are processed to produce 16 other non-structural proteins, which are named nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins including keyhole (S), wrapper (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lines of CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV genera contain the majority of HCoVs and are divided into four families (A, B, C, and D).
Ethnological evidence shows that bats and mice serve as the gene source for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main source for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed the interspecies barrier and emerged as several major human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoV-clusters) have been identified.
Among these, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as the common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively high proportion of patients with highly pathogenic, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and high risk of out-of-lung exposure.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was collected from nasal secretions of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge was gained through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, the idea was widely accepted that infection by HCoVs was generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating in recent history, infecting 8,000 people and causing an unprecedented death rate of around 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak continues to plague the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadically to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), subsequently named SARS-CoV-2, is the active agent of the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has resulted in more than 3,120 deaths and 91,000 infections as of 3 March 2020.
Alarm bells are ringing and the world needs to prepare for the coming outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
Each of the seven HCoVs has an animal origin from bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where the viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented huge medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
The search for animal origins of HCoV-clusters provides a framework for understanding the reasons for the natural history, driving forces and limitations of species-to-species (species-jumping) migration.
It may guide or guide the search for the origin, intermediate and amplifying animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the prevention of future spills.
In this review, we present an overview of the animal origins, inter-species transmission and pathogenicity of HCoV-clusters.
In particular, we would like to draw attention to this general context and discuss that the parent viruses of HCoV-clusters are usually pathogenic in their natural host but become pathogenic after entering the body of a new host.
We also review the evolutionary trends of HCoVs where pathogenicity often decreases as infectivity increases.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Various CoV-groups were collected from various infected animals including turkeys, rats, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs before the first collection of B814 of the HCoV-229E strain from nasal secretions of common cold patients.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Common cold symptoms including headache, sneezing, nausea and sore throat were reported in patients infected with HCoV-229E, and fever and cough were reported in 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was collected from organ cultures and subsequent repeated growth of the virus in the brains of dairy rats.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be symptomatically distinguished from infection with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed and are mainly transmitted in winter climates during the monsoon season.
Typically, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
A study of human volunteers showed that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients were found to have severe lower respiratory tract infections.
"SARS, also known as ""atypical pneumonia"", was the first documented HCoV-related pandemic in human history and its causative agent was SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV".
The first case of SARS was found in China's Guangdong Province in late 2002.
The SARS pandemic has resulted in 8,096 cases reported across many countries and continents, including 774 deaths.
In addition to super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case could increase by about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and showing the final symptoms of viral load as the disease appears on the 10th day.
In patients with SARS-CoV, muscle aches, headaches, fever, discomfort and respiratory distress, cough and shortness of breath after a cold are the primary symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function tests and increased creatinine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Dispersed alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and growth of macrophages were also observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation at a later stage.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can become infected in severe cases, usually with cytokine disruption that can be especially fatal in patients with immune system disorders.
The virus was first collected from an open lung biopsy of a relative of an indicator patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of effort has been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was collected from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was primarily prevalent in young children, the elderly and patients with respiratory illness who had a weakened immune system.
Common diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 in chorea, raised eyes, fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the collection of the same virus from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was first identified in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is identified as the cause of about 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses, with the highest incidence occurring in summer, spring and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was collected from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to group-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma.
HCoV-HKU1, similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illness.
All four groups of acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally unlikely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic disease, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons, such as a rare case of a highly malignant subtype of HCoV-NL63 that has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Typically, when these HCoVs gain the ability to effectively transmit and maintain themselves in humans, they become relatively less harmful or even contagious.
In 2012, MERS-CoV was first collected from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and rhinoplasty in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases have originated in the Middle East, cases have been reported from outside, with occasional second-stage outbreaks in close contacts in various European countries and Tunisia.
In 2015, another Phase II outbreak occurred in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
Characterized by progressive acute pneumonia, MERS's diagnostic manifestations are similar to SARS.
Apart from SARS, many patients with MERS also developed severe renal impairment, which is unique to MERS among HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms of stomach ailments such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratories have confirmed a mortality rate of over 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses to the human body.
In mid-to-late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China as being related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and designated the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a mortality rate of roughly 3.4%.
Notably, the fatality rate in Hubei in China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although 82% high nucleotide sequence is very similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 due to homology, they cluster in different branches of the ethnographic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be relatively less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may play a role in its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparisons and comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great interest.
First, the incubation period of the pathogen and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is midway between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs that infect the population (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections exhibit features that are typically seen during community-acquired HCoV-cluster infections with non-specific, mild or even asymptomatic presentations.
On the other hand, a small proportion of severe cases of COVID-19 also show symptoms of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is somewhat lower.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 infection cluster shows intriguing characteristic patterns of both acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is at least as transmissible as the group-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmission rate decreases after human transmission as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as in the case of SARS-CoV-2.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether fecal-oral infection by SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role, at least in some situations such as SARS-CoV, remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is of particular interest to see if SARS-CoV-2 also exhibits seasonal adaptation in the same way as community-acquired HCoVs.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after human transmission, will be influential in the ultimate outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All four groups of mildly symptomatic acquired HCoVs have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be descendants of ancient HCoV epidemics.
HCoVs that cause severe illness in humans and humans that develop severe HCoV disease have been identified.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient quantities to accumulate adaptive mutations that fight off the factors of host restriction.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to fully adapt to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its transmission to humans by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four groups of acquired CoVs have been spreading in human populations, causing the onset of the common cold-cough among patients with normal immunity.
These viruses do not require an animal basis.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and cannot be transmitted to humans.
They need to maintain and spread on their zoonotic bases and possibly seek out opportunities to spread to potential human targets through one or more intermediate and amplifying nutrients.
SARS-CoV-2 has features that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least for now, it is as highly transmissible as community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than group-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen if it adapts well to humans and whether it continues to spread to humans without any intermediate animal nutrients.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV-clusters, it would be beneficial to discuss the definition and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, base, intermediate and propagation hosts of HCoV-clusters.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host for HCoV if it harbors a closely related ancestor by sharing higher homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus usually adapts well to the host and is not pathogenic.
Similarly, an Aadhaar host provides HCoVs with a continuous and long-term shelter.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infectious and are natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host before or just around the time of human exposure, it does not adapt well to the new host and often becomes pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and can act as an amplifying host in allowing the virus to temporarily replicate and then spread the human infection through its transmission to the human body.
If HCoV cannot continue transmission between intermediate hosts, transmission may slow down.
Conversely, HCoVs may also adapt to intermediate hosts and start long-term outbreaks.
In this case, the intermediate nutrient becomes the natural base nutrient.
Epidemiological data revealed that the history of contact with predatory animals was indicative of SARS.
Subsequent seroprevalence findings indicated that there were higher outbreaks of anti-SARS-CoV IgG among animal traders than in the general population.
A raccoon dog at snail (pygma larva) and live animal markets was first identified to carry a SARS-CoV-like virus that was almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further cases of SARS were reported after all the bedbugs were killed in the markets.
However, it was reported that masked palm civets from wild or farmed areas without exposure to live animal markets were largely negative for SARS CoV, indicating that masked palm civets would only act as intermediate amplifier hosts but not as a natural basis for SARS-CoV.
Significantly, since 80% of the animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals may also act as intermediate amplifying nutrients for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of these are thought to be monophosphores of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent investigations of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related rhinoceros bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is present in the Chinese horse bat. Subsequent investigations revealed a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related rhinoceros bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatKU HCoV3), which is present in the Chinese horse bat.
These bats were positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for new ideas that bats harbor emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV-clusters) have been identified from bats, but none other than a designated WIV1 can be collected as live viruses.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2.
WIV1 derived from bat faecal samples was shown to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as receptors for cell entry.
Interestingly, the serums of patients recovering from SARS were able to inactivate WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is a high degree of homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 SARS-CoV is not an immediate parental virus and that bats are not the immediate base hosts of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analyses classify MERS-CoVs in the same class as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipoptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to enter the virus.
RNA polymerase sequences of RNA-dependent MERS-CoVs are phylogenetically close to those of bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoVs have been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Thus, bats may not be the immediate base hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, Middle Eastern studies have shown that single-clawed camels are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific suppressive antibodies, just like camels of Middle Eastern origin in several African countries.
An active MERS-CoV similar to the virus found in humans was collected from a nasal swab of a camel with a coiled tail, further indicating that the camel acts as the actual host of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that experimentally infected camels with MERS-CoV have been shown to have a high rate of viral shedding, although usually with mild symptoms.
Notably, infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the anal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission of the virus from bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS had no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, possibly from human-to-human infection or from an unknown animal species that harbors MERS-CoV.
Bat CoV RaTG13 collected from Rhinolephus affinis bats has a 96.2% similarity to the nucleotide homology of SARS-CoV-2.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too high to determine parental relationships.
This means that bats may not be the direct carrier of SARS-CoV-2 unless nearly identical bat CoVs are found in the future.
Most likely, the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wildlife sold and killed at the Hunan seafood wholesale market, with which many early cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a possible animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggest that a group of endangered small mammals known as the forest mouse (Manis javannica) may also carry SARS-CoV-2 related paternal beta-CoVs.
The nucleotide sequence homology of 85-92% of these novel Bonroy CoV genomes is replicated for SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally associated with RaTG13 with about 90% uniformity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They cluster in two sub-clans of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the gene tree, one of which shares the same receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with a 97.4% amino acid sequence identification.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 diverged further, although the sequence homology was genome-wide to a higher degree.
A previous study on ill Bonroy also reported the detection of viral sequence sequences from lung samples, which have been shown to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted various assembly methods and manual presentations to produce partial genome sequences with approximately 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal nutrients of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct Bonroy origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequential separation between SARS-CoV-2 and Bonroy SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV-clusters.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is much shorter than for the beta-CoVs of SARS-CoV-2 and Bonroy SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary course of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
While most sequence homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and Bonrûi's RBDs, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV-groups, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the most genome-specific sequence homology.
It is highly unlikely that Bonroy is driven by RBD-related beta-CoVs of SARS-CoV-2 and high similarity selectivity-mediated parental evolution between SARS-CoV-2.
A counter-proposal is for a recombination between a third wildlife species, a Bonroy SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination between beta-CoVs is widespread.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoVs, animal sources of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E originated from bat CoVs, although the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
A bat CoV, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), identified in North American Tricolor bats with HCoV-NL63 has been reported to show close association.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, Hipposideros/Ghanacowam/19/2008, although camelliids have also been suspected as intermediate carriers.
For clarity, the animal sources of known HCoV-clusters are summarized in current knowledge in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnic analysis has provided evidence of historical inter-species transmission events of CoVs.
A respiratory epidemic occurred in the 1890s when HCoV-OC43 crossed species and infected humans from domestic animals.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is relatively unclear.
Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
One of them is an alpaca-alpha CoV.
There is a lot of evidence to support the transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, shared ecosystems can be from bats' contact with humans but not with alpacas.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with the alpaca.
Second, HCoV-229E-associated bat alpha-CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic among bats, while alpaca alpha-CoVs cause respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that alpacas get HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not very surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Bat alpha-CoVs, on the other hand, act as the gene pool for HCoV-229E, while alpacas and unicorns can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as a great example of the spread of interspecies infection from bats to a spiny camel and from a spiny camel to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at the initial detection and is further confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is clear that bats provide a rich base of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic material and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, a colony that is full of larvae, close social interaction and strong flight capabilities are the conditions for bats to be the ideal 'virus spreaders'.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, came into contact with a camel with a coiled tail decades ago.
It adapts well to these camels which have evolved from an intermediate shelter to a stable and natural base shelter.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains relatively low transmission rates in these animals.
Its dispersed transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain the last refuge of MERS-CoV as its transmission is not sustainable.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV infection, the role of pangolins in SARS-CoV-2 infection is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic among pangolins.
They may be the last hosts for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similar to the stink bugs in SARS-CoV.
The various possibilities of interspecies animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may need to be included or excluded in future studies.
First, bats may be the primary hosts of a SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is almost similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, the forest roe could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts where a SARS-CoV-2 related virus was newly introduced.
People are infected by cutting and eating the meat of prey.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are immune to SARS-CoV-2.
A study in domestic and wild animals for antibodies has been confirmed.
Third, as mentioned above, the reassortment and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated.
In addition to the different animal hosts, three major factors on the viral side are also important in helping CoVs to cross the interspecies barrier.
First, their relatively high rate of mutation into RNA replicas.
"Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs can be considered ""medium"" to ""high"" depending on the degree of CoV adaptation of the novel host, and the average replacement rate is ~10-4 replacements per site per year".
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, the elimination of which results in excessive variability and fragility or even the inability to survive.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of remdesivir is known to replicate CoV by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds tested in clinical trials.
Yet, the mutation rates of CoVs are nearly a million times higher than their host.
In addition, when CoVs do not adapt well to the host, the mutation rate is often high.
Compared to SARS-CoVs with higher mutation rates, SARS-CoV-2 has a relatively low mutation rate, indicating a better adaptation to humans.
It is likely that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
As well as SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to a single-clawed camel.
In theory, the genetic drift of SARS-CoV-2 is highly unlikely to rapidly render vaccines and antivirals ineffective.
Second, the large RNA of the CoV uses extra flexibility in genome mutation for mutation and recombination, thereby increasing the possibility of evolution with interconnections, which is conducive to the emergence of CoV-clusters when conditions become favorable.
It is supported by a number of unique encoded open reading frames and protein functions at the 3′ end of the genome.
"Third, CoVs change templates while replicating RNA at random and often through a unique ""copy-selection"" process".
Strand switching often occurs during CoV RNA replication in the host that acts as the blending vessel.
Higher homologous full-length and subgenome specific RNAs can recombine to form new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animal CoV-groups such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Viral-host interactions related to infection
In addition to the three viral components described above, viral exchange with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies infection.
Meanwhile, the recombination of SARS-CoV was taken as a prime example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between human and larval SARS-CoV collections, SARS-CoV is thought to be able to rapidly adapt to mutations of RBD in different hosts, especially S proteins.
Typically, RBD interacts with the cellular receptor on a CoV's S protein and is strongly selective by response to host antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is present on the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment which binds to human ACE2 as well as its coreceptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV's RBD is able to recognize ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals including bats, civets, mice, and raccoon dogs, which can cause interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found to be distinct from the virulent isolates of the yeast in humans and RBD, and 4 of them are located in a receptor-binding pattern to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV RBD contains K479N and S487T mutations, which may increase the affinity for spike protein exchange with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the substitution of these two amino acids may be critical to viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy that the cellular receptors of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar.
A 30% difference between the S1 unit of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV's S protein suggests that the tendency of its S protein to bind to human ACE2 may be altered.
In fact, a cryo-EM study indicated a 10 to 20-fold higher binding tendency than that found between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It is also important to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Concernfully, HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2 but with a different S-segment.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also account for the successful adaptation of these CoVs to humans after infection from their animal hosts to interspecies.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcomes of interspecies transmission of HCoV-clusters are also driven by factors of dependence and limitation on other hosts.
The splitting of these host proteins between natural hosts of human and HCoV-communities such as bats, unicorns and mice may prevent interspecies transmission.
HCoVs must occupy host-dependent factors and destroy host-constraining factors for a successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interactions have yet to be identified and characterized.
A neutral genome-wide screening of host dependence and restrictions for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR may be effective.
Emergence of novel HCoVs: Back to where they started
Variation of bat CoV-clusters provides ample opportunity for the emergence of novel HCoV-clusters.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as gene pools for HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, novel protein-coding genes have the potential to drastically modify the acquisition or loss of viral phenotypes.
Of the SARS-CoV adjuvant proteins, ORF8 has been thought to be important in adapting to humans because SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were collected but were found to encode differentiated ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide deletion trait of SARS-CoV-cluster has been found in strains collected at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This cleavage splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and appears to be an adaptive mutation that encourages shelter switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of potential recombination with alpha- and gamma-CoV groups, where large numbers of small recombination regions were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Recombination sites were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the pandemic MERS-CoV passed through a series of recombination events between different clans, which occurred in the case of a curly camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs recombine with CoVs from other animals in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in the viral genome, possibly resulting in the release of viruses from selective pressures such as the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype formula due to di-nucleotide removal.
While intact ORF4 can be seen in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoVs appear to be localized within a single nucleotide, resulting in frame shifts.
But last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by selective pressures on their hosts.
When bats were infected by CoVs, they were asymptomatic or had only mild symptoms, indicating an interactive adaptation between CoVs and bats.
Bats have been found to be well adapted to CoVs both in origin and physiology.
For example, defects in activation of the inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce CoV-induced pathology.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to low expression levels of the suppressive natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the major histocompatibility complex class I molecule.
Furthermore, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress replication of CoV and influence proofreading by exoribonucleases, thus providing the selective pressure necessary to produce strains of the virus when exposed to a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains can also evolve through recombination leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, the likelihood of three new HCoVs emerging in the last two decades is not coincidental.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their host hosts such as bats and camels.
They grow firmly without a strong host resistance response.
This is the key to why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes serious human infections.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is isolated from the CoV variant.
The same strategy of disconnecting the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the use of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
Also, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is defective.
By this reasoning, NLRP3 inhibitors including MCC950 may be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same general patterns by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
On the one hand, a bat beta-CoV has been found that shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, while there is also a bat-CoV that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although snails and other animals found on the market have been reported to harbor viruses similar to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Unusually homologous Bonroy beta-CoVs have been found with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that Bonroy would act as one of the intermediate hosts or that Bonroy beta-CoVs could contribute gene sequences to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was either intentionally or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have once again been in the spotlight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of the importance of animal origins and animal bases of HCoVs in human infection.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bat source and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and cockroaches in markets, killing cockroaches there by closing wet markets could have effectively ended the SARS pandemic.
By the same logic, in view of the discovery of multiple clans of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent animal infection.
However, what exactly and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through wild boars and other mammals remains to be clarified in future investigations.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been present in single-clawed camels for a long time.
These camels serve as a major source of meat, milk, leather and fur for the local people in addition to being an important means of transportation.
They are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in the wildlife market in China to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a holistic approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
As we are unable to eradicate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge to cause outbreaks.
Many animal CoVs are circulating in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs with animal potential are highly diverse.
There is a high potential for these zoonotic CoVs to multiply and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that will be more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
In some parts of China, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the fire test of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a better preparedness and response plan.
Many viruses have been around for a very long time.
They remain in their natural habitat until they have a chance to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chances of human exposure to bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are made aware to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecosystems of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove effective in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent animal-borne diseases in humans is to stay away from the ecological niche of the natural source of animal viruses.
Several pieces of the animal origin puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, it is necessary to see under what circumstances bats and bats may share the same ecological niche if bats transmit the parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to bats.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how people come into contact with bats should be determined.
Third, if a tertiary mammal acts as a true intermediate nourisher, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
Whether it is bats, pangolins or any other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent viruses will be identified in its natural hosts in the future.
Continued investigations in this area will explain the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the criteria for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid advisory guide for the detection and treatment of Novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guide provided our experience and made good reference for the fight against the pandemic worldwide.
However, as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are also increasing gradually based on ongoing research findings and experience from clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment techniques are also being continuously updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment regarding our guidelines and provide a brand new diagnostic criteria for suspected cases and confirmed cases, in accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which is officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), occurred.
On 11 March 2020, WHO designated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick advice guide and it has been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
Since its release, it has received a huge response.
Keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are also increasing gradually based on ongoing research findings and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being continuously updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have been published in a total of seven editions, each with some significant changes in content.
Now Zhou and his colleagues have commented on our guidelines, they have recommended a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and also provided valuable references for the global pandemic.
We acknowledge their remarkable work and thank them.
However, their work will also need to be updated in line with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (Trial 7th edition) and latest research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case, a detailed analysis must have two clinical symptoms with one of the epidemiological historical features, or three clinical symptoms if there is no clear epidemiological history, for this reason.
Epidemiological history: (1) history of residents of or travel to Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (positive on nucleic acid test); (3) history of exposure to patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan City or surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) history of exposure to clusters of cases (infection in small areas such as homes, offices, school classrooms, etc. within 2 weeks and ≥ 2 k/h respiratory infection).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) showing normal, decreased or decreased total white blood cell counts in the early onset phase.
For a confirmed case diagnosis based on a suspected case, there should be pathogenic or serological evidence of any of the following: (1) SARS-CoV-2 determinant positive in real-time PCR test; (2) high homogeneity or similarity with known novel coronavirus in full gene sequencing of the virus; (3) serum test positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; or SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody positive from negative to negative, and ≥4 increase in severity in the recovery and progression stages.
We have found that the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions have included a respiratory nucleic acid determinant real time PCR test and blood samples.
Pathogenicity of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to quickly diagnose these changes by searching for a suitable nucleic acid detection kit for blood samples including respiratory tract samples, which increases the availability of various samples and which helps to bring certain antibody positive results to the assured criteria.
Moreover, more and more evidence is emerging, reminding us to be cautious with patients with irregular symptoms and those without.
Therefore, Zhou and his colleagues should update the flow list, as they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be validated in subsequent clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will come and readers will call for their comments.
To diagnose suspected and confirmed cases, we recommend that they be identified and follow the latest guidelines in their country.
Our team will update our guide in a timely manner to help.
Bangladesh reported five new daily COVID-19 deaths.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
Yesterday, the Institute of Pathology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported that the number of reported cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news release, IEDCR Director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirzadi, two of the cases are over 60 years old, two are between 51 and 60 years old and one is 41-50 years old.
He added that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March.
An official at the hospital told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitri Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Kader said public transport will be closed for longer than originally planned until next Saturday.
The closure of public transport started on 26th March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4th April.
The movement of essential goods like medical, fuel and food was still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 infection was recorded in Bangladesh on 8 March among two people who returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, the three have recovered so far.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 infected people worldwide has exceeded one million.
The total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide surpassed one million on Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to the coronavirus-caused disease, COVID-19.
The landmark event occurred on the same day that Malawi confirmed their first coronavirus infection and Zambia's first coronavirus-related death.
As of Thursday, North Korea claimed to be one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, WHO has documented 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the previous twenty-four hours at 10 am Central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases were documented, with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 people in the United States died from coronavirus infection on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries announced tough measures to contain the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin announced that payments will be maintained even if Russians do not go to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; it passed with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to last all day; the previous curfew was only in effect from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew from 10pm to 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended its curfew until May 1.
Stores in Australia have reduced the limit of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Kohl's reduced the purchase limit for toilet paper per transaction at all stores nationwide to two and one package respectively.
Also, in September, ALDI introduced a one-pack limit.
The restrictions were posted as messages at check-outs and on the chain's Facebook pages.
Shoppers were reportedly stocking up for fear of COVID-19 if people had to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the sale of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
The changes follow the previous post-transaction four-pack limitation that Woolworths and Coles introduced on March 4 and 5, respectively.
"On March 8, Coles announced through a campaign that the four-pack ban had been introduced in several places, but that ""many stores are still selling out within an hour of supply"", calling the demand ""unprecedented"" and in a Facebook post on Tuesday at ALDI they called it ""unexpected"".
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, sales increased sharply last week.
Costco stores in Canberra were also allowed two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles orders larger packages from suppliers and increases the supply recurrence rate, Woolworths orders extra stock, while ALDI makes stock available in advance for a planned special Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on delivery by truck made it difficult.
As suppliers try to meet demand, he expects production costs to rise.
ALDI announced on Tuesday that after having already taken out stock, some stores could not operate Wednesday special sales.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said stores fill up their inventory every night.
He commented that toilet paper is a heavy material and that the stock is so low that when it is sold out, huge shelves are empty, reinforcing the feeling of scarcity.
"Coles and Woolworths believe that if they have a lot of stuff, and things like toilet rolls and sanitiser [can be bought], and they have enough, then maybe that fear will be reduced", Russell Zimmerman said, according to ABC News.
Who Gives A Crap, a manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, said on Wednesday that it was running out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the makers of the Clinex toilet tissue and solaris paper that makes the surfactant, insisted they are working 24/7 to maintain supplies.
A real estate site Domain.com reported that some property sellers are giving free toilet paper to the first bidder at auction in Melbourne, with some of the auctions being held because buyers had a long Labor Day weekend off.
In this Thursday edition of NT News, published daily in Darwin, an eight-page supplement is given for cutting into pieces and using them as toilet paper.
A report from ABC Australia on 3 March said that shops were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, where they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on shopping.
Russell Zimmerman also said that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitizers, dry products, handwashes and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, the sale of Andres toilet paper is limited to two 12-roll packs every Sunday evening at the online British supermarket Okado.
WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic.
"Although the term ""epidemic"" does not refer to how dangerous specific cases are but to how widespread any disease is, the WHO noted the need for governments to take action:"
"All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic".
"WHO Secretary-General Adhanom Ghebreyesus said if states can identify, ""can test, treat, isolate, identify and synthesize""
"We are deeply concerned by both the alarming level of disease spread and severity and the alarming level of inactivity".
"According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global pandemic is ""unprecedented""".
"In a February CNN commentary, he said, ""No other respiratory virus, other than influenza, has tracked the time since its origin to its continuing global spread"."
Gebresas shares the same opinion, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before".
"And we've never seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time", he continued.
The new status of a global pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, ""Fuck, it's going to get worse"."
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that the number of COVID-19 infections worldwide is at least 126,000 resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and UTs, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Around 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China is estimated at 4%, while worldwide the range is from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary care is symptomatic and supportive therapy.Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's face when coughing, keeping distance from other people, and observing and isolating oneself for people suspected of being infected.
Authorities worldwide have responded with travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and facility closures.
The global pandemic has led to severe global socio-economic disruption, with sporting, religious, political and cultural events cancelled, and fear-mongering shopping exacerbating supply shortages.
Schools and universities are either nationally or locally closed across 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's total student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against other people from China, East and Southeast Asia, and others from areas where significant cases of the virus have been found, based on ethnicity and appearance.
Due to the closure of travel and heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
In Wuhan (the capital of Hubei Province), China, health authorities reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to a wholesale market of Hunan seafood and the virus is thought to have an animal source.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the bat coronavirus, the Bonroy coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The person who first developed symptoms was later reported to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019; and there was no visible link to the Wet Market cluster subsequently.
The market was linked to two-thirds of the initial cluster of cases in December 2019.
An unverified report in the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 indicated that a case found to be originating on 17 November 2019 was possibly the first, in a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that new infections in China had so-called declined, but had spiked in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases outside China had surpassed the number of new cases inside China for the first time.
The number of cases may have been underreported, especially in people with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases have been reported among young people, most of them under the age of 19 and 2.4% of cases worldwide.Patrick Valence, Chief Scientific Adviser at the United Kingdom, estimates that 60% of the British population needs to be infected before immunity can be gained among the working population.
The number of cases as per the official protocol refers to the number of people who have been tested positive for COVID-19.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had formalised policies not to test only people with mild symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that as of 23 January, about 86% of COVID-19 infections in China were undetected, and this uncontacted infection was the source of 79% of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the official estimates.
Initial estimates of the normal reproductive count (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it was probably 5.7.
Most people who are infected with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the interval from onset of symptoms to death is 6 to 41 days, with the most common interval being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been reported to be related to COVID-19.
As of 5 February, 80% of deaths in China have been among people over 60 years of age, and 75% of these people had pre-existing conditions including heart disease and diabetes.Official COVID-19 death statistics usually refer to those who were infected with COVID according to traditional rules.
The number of deaths as a result of COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include all people who died without testing - such as at home, nursing home, etc.
Some partial data from Italy showed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death rate.
"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged ""We know that [the reported death toll] is a lower estimate than the actual number"", a statement echoed by the report that there is a low number of uninformed deaths in the United States. Such underestimates are frequent in global pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020".
The first death outside mainland China was reported in the Philippines on February 1 and the first death outside Asia was reported in France on February 14.
As of February 28, nearly a dozen deaths have been reported outside mainland China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, deaths have been reported in nearly forty countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of healthcare systems, treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.The death-to-infection ratio shows the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases in a given time frame.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the worldwide death to case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimated ratio of deaths to cases has dropped from 17.3% (of those with symptoms between 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (of those with symptoms for the first time since 1 February 2020).Other preventive measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed persons who have died from a disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed or undiagnosed) who have died from a disease.
These figures are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection through case analysis.
Many scholars have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The calculations at the upper end of this range are consistent with a statistical study of the first randomized trials of COVID-19 in Germany and an analysis of the test's effect on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic is under control.
The maximum extent and final timing of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary by location.
"As the disease goes from untested, infectious outbreaks usually dominate and then begin to decay when the disease no longer has a host", said McAfee Bonnie of Penn State University.
But at the moment it is almost impossible to make any predictions about when that will happen.
"Zhong Nansan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that it could be ""ended by June"" if all countries could unite to follow WHO advice to prevent the spread of the virus".
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 ""will probably continue to spread for one or two years"."
"According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, ""until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more) "" physical distancing and other measures are needed".
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I think it's highly unlikely that the coronavirus, because it spreads so quickly, will disappear completely"" and that it ""could become a seasonal disease, coming back every year""".
The severity of the return will depend on the animal's immunity and the extent of the mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively non-specific and infected individuals may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Relatively uncommon symptoms include: numbness, respiratory sputum production (cough), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coffee spitting, diarrhea, or syanosis. WHO states that about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, waking up, and bluish face or lips as emergency symptoms; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some of the infected may be asymptomatic with no clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm the infection, so the researchers have recommended that people who have been in contact with confirmed infected people should also be monitored and tested to avoid transmission.
Chinese estimates of asymptomatic rates range from a few to 44%.
The range of the normal incubation (incubation period) stage (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is one to 14 days; the average is five days. Based on the uncertainty example, the fraction of individuals with COVID-19 who initially had olfactory loss accounted for 30% and those who subsequently had olfactory loss accounted for 15%.
Details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is thought to be spread mainly during close contact and by small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact means being between 1 and 2 metres (3 and 6 feet).
Studies have shown that water particles from an open cough can travel from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some suggest that the virus can also be transmitted by small droplets of fluid that may be produced during speech that remain in the air for long periods of time. Respiratory laryngitis can also be produced during exhalation, including during speech, although the virus is not usually airborne.
Water particles can enter the mouth or nose of those close to them or they can enter the lungs through inhalation.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can convert respiratory excretion into aerosols and consequently airborne.
It can also be spread when someone touches any contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that it can spread through feces, the risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oral infection from SARS-CoV-2 feces.The virus is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms appear.Although it can also be transmitted before and after the onset of symptoms, the disease is not transmitted by the feces of humans.
Many people have tested positive three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that the disease can be transmitted before any significant symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but some countries have detected asymptomatic infections during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads but one person typically infects two to three people.
Specifically, the virus was found on plastic (polypropylene) for three days, 304 stainless steel, cardboard for one day and copper for four hours.
This, in turn, varies depending on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend hand washing after contact with animals, just as touching other surfaces by an infected person is recommended.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus first isolated from three pneumonia cases associated with a group of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All of the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all related coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap as it breaks down the virus's protective covering. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's thought to be the source of a zoonotic disease.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically related to the genus Betacoronavirus and two bat strains in the subgenus Serbovirus (lineage B).
Another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13) had a 96% complete genome level of exactly one.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found in research that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between the virus in the forest and the virus in the human body.
To date, a comparison of the entire genome has found that there is a 92% genetic similarity between the B. coronariensis and SARS-CoV-2 at very high levels, which is insufficient to prove that B. coronariensis acted as a host in between.
Transmission via the virus can be diagnosed temporarily depending on symptoms, but can be definitively confirmed by reverse transmission polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of infected lalards.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less accurate, and that many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for COVID-19 diagnosis""".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on a breath or blood sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
The test is usually performed on a nasopharyngeal swab, but a throat swab may also be used. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been shown to be sufficiently accurate to be authorised for long-term use.
In the United States, the serological test developed by CELEX is authorized for emergency use only by approved laboratories.
Characteristic features of imaging on radiography and computed tomography (CT) of people with symptoms include asymmetrical peripheral ground glass opacity and absence of pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of images from the examination of confirmed cases.
The PCR for mixing with other infections such as adenovirus has been restricted to making any imaging and detecting COVID-19 without any confirmation.
A large study in China compared PCR to chest CT results and explained that although imaging of the infection is now less specific, it is faster and more sensitive, which suggests considering it as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
An artificial intelligence-based cloning agency has been developed to characterise the virus through radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of disease include maintaining good overall personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and sneezing or coughing into tissue and discarding that tissue directly in a garbage can.
People who may already have the infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent infection.Many governments advised or restricted all non-essential travel from countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached mass spread in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community and some people in the community do not know where or how they were infected. Healthcare providers caring for someone who may be infected are recommended to use evidence precautions, contact precautions and eye protection.
The administration's use of mobile phone location information for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations issued a statement calling for such surveillance to be limited.
Multiple mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to others' mobile phones.
Users will then receive a message if they come into contact with a COVID-19 positive person. There are many misconceptions about how to prevent the infection.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many companies are working to develop one.
Hand washing was recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water at least twenty seconds at a time, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; before rinsing their noses, coughing, or sneezing.
Since the virus can be killed outside the human body with household soap, which bursts the protective bubble of the virus.
The CDC recommends that when soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol instead.
WHO advises people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute of contact with disinfectant in the case of stainless steel surfaces), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate are comparatively less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in an office or daycare setting, then offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices, such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATM machines used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people fold their mouth and nose elbows or cover with tissue paper when coughing or sneezing and dispose of the tissue properly.
Those who are at risk of infection are advised to wear surgical masks.Wearing a mask can control the amount of particulate matter released when talking, sneezing or coughing and the extent of spread.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
"According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, ""mask wearers can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene"".
WHO advises healthy people to wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those caring for someone with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their face.
Some countries have begun encouraging people to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical facial masks made of cloth.China specifically recommends that healthy members of the public use disposable medical masks, especially when approaching other people close (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when travelling on public transport or in public places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
It is forbidden to go outdoors without a mask or face coverings in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has mandated that a face mask be worn when entering every grocery store.
Israel asks all its residents to wear face masks whenever they go out.
Taiwan, which has been producing about 10 million masks per day since mid-March, requires passengers to wear face masks on trains and interstate buses for travel on April 1.
Panama has made wearing masks mandatory whenever you go out and recommended that those who cannot afford face masks wear homemade face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Maintaining social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes controlling the spread of infection by reducing close contact between individuals and slowing the rate of spread of the disease.
The measures include: quarantine; restricted travel; closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shops.
Individuals can implement social distancing practices by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, greeting without touching and maintaining physical distance from each other.
Many governments are now making social distancing mandatory or advising in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by US government authorities and health organizations quickly dropped from 250 people (unless the area is known to have COVID-19) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the public gathering of more than two people. Older adults and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and impaired immune systems are at increased risk of serious illness and complications, and CDC advised them to stay at home as much as possible in outbreak areas in society. In late March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began to replace the term ""social distancing"" with ""physical distancing"", to explain that its goal is to maintain physical contact by virtually distancing or social contact".
The use of the term "social distancing" has impacted in a way that has led to people becoming completely isolated from others rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others in alternative ways.Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health for use during the pandemic.
This included the advice to only have sex with someone who lives with you, who does not have the virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
Home self-isolation is recommended for those who are infected with COVID-19 and those who suspect themselves to be infected.
Health agencies issue detailed guidelines for appropriate self-isolation.Many governments make self-quarantine mandatory or recommended for all residents living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine guidelines have been issued for high-risk groups.
People who have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with high prevalence are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible contact.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment and eradication.
Suppression measures are taken in the early stages of the outbreak, and other infection control measures are aimed at initiating and vaccinating in addition to tracking and isolating infected people to stop the disease from spreading to the remaining population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease in any other way, efforts move to mitigation: some remedies are taken to slow down the spread and reduce its impact on the healthcare system and society.
At the same time, a mixed approach of both containment and mitigation may be required.
More extreme measures in suppression are needed to reverse the epidemic cycle to a level below the initial reproductive number of 1. Maximum epidemic threshold reduction is part of the response to an outbreak of an infectious disease, known as epidemic curve leveling.
It reduces healthcare risks and gives more time for vaccines and treatments to improve.
Other ways that the outbreak can be controlled other than medication include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; public measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as closing schools and cancelling public gatherings; acknowledging and involving the public in other such ways to control the outbreak; as well as environmental measures, such as cleaning surfaces.
Other countries have also adopted a series of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass testing and local quarantine, and issued warnings on the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and increased the fines for medical supply fraud.The efforts of Great Britain and the United States demonstrate that mitigation (slowing down but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and containment (increasing the response to the epidemic) are major challenges.
While best-efforts policies can reduce peak demand for healthcare by two thirds and deaths by half, health systems are still being disrupted resulting in millions of deaths.
Suppression may be the preferred approach but must be maintained for as long as the virus continues to circulate in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if it comes first), as otherwise viral transmission will return quickly only if measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic have caused social and economic losses.
No specific antiviral drugs are approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cough and cold medicines, drinking fluids and rest can alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, oxygen therapy, intravenous (through the vein) fluids and respiratory support may be required.
Steroid use can be worse.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also stated that some traditional and home remedies help to alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and acquisition of health facilities for COVID-19 patients has been described by WHO as a preventive measure to contain the outbreak of the disease.
The ECDC and WHO's European Regional Directorate have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary care delivery centres to remove sources at multiple levels and include increasing laboratory focus on testing for COVID-19, increasing the number of intensive monitoring by isolating and quarantining COVID-19 positive patients and training staff and increasing the number of ventilation and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case (so-called Patient Zero) may have originated.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was detected on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has been steadily increasing in a month.
Most of these were related to the Hunan seafood wholesale market, where live animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or in other words, it has an animal source.A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was detected on December 26 and treated at Hubei Provincial Hospital by Dr. Zhang Jixian, who reported it to Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
"On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a ""SARS-like coronavirus""".
Eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Feng, was harassed by his top staff for sounding the alarm.
Later, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
In early January, a number of cases of undiagnosed pneumonia were reported in Wuhan that are under investigation.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
During the early and mid-2020s, the virus spread to other parts of China, aided by Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub and major rail junction.
On January 20, China reported that it had detected about 140 new cases in a single day, including two people from Beijing and one from Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data showed that as of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms.As of 26 March, the United States has seen the highest number of confirmed cases in the world, surpassing China and Italy.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
There was at least one case of infection in about 200 countries and territories.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area restrict free movement and impose border controls.
The national response includes some repressive measures such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders or lockdowns) and curfews.As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or 90% of the population, are in some form of lockdown in the United States, over 50 million people are in lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India.

"After these notices were published, the police warned Wuhan doctors against "spreading rumors" about the outbreak".
"The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no ""clear evidence"" of human-to-human transmission".
"In late January, the Chinese government launched a revolutionary campaign that was later described by Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, as a ""people's war"" to control the spread of the virus".

Private vehicles were banned in the city.
The celebration of Chinese New Year (January 25) has been cancelled in several places.

The spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed on 20 January 2020.
The country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely blamed on the Daegu New Religious Movement, also known as the Shincheonji Church of Judaism.
Visitors to the Shinchangji Church, which is a pilgrimage site in Daegu from Wuhan, were suspected of being the source of the outbreak.
On 22 February, 1,261 out of 9,336 followers of the Church, or about 13%, reported symptoms.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea on 28 February, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.

Airline schedules were also affected and therefore changed.South Korea launched a program to test people for the virus and isolate infected people and to track and quarantine those they have come into contact with, which is considered the largest and best organized program in the world.
Screening methods include self-reporting of symptoms for new international arrivals through mobile apps, drive-through testing of the virus with results available the next day and testing capacity to 20,000 people daily.
The program in South Korea without complete quarantining of cities has been considered a successful effort to contain the outbreak.South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have either claimed the outbreak was officially misused and signed a petition calling for Moon's impeachment or praising his response.

Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, who denied a previous claim that the COVID-19 outbreak first began in Wuhan, had originated from the United States or Italy.
"The US administration of Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" or ""Wuhan virus"" saying that China's ""censorship has supercharged a virus that has now become a global pandemic"", which in response some critics criticized as racism and called ""an attempt to distract from its administration's failure to contain the disease"".

The pandemic in Australia has opened up a new opportunity for daigu sellers to sell Australian goods in China.
The activity led to a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and subsequent ban by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, both areas have been struggling to keep themselves free from severe food shortages, ensuring an overwhelming demand for food.
Measures in China and Italy to stockpile essential goods and combat illegal trade have been successful, avoiding the severe food shortages that were predicted in North America as well as Europe.
Although there is no significant decline in agricultural output in northern Italy, industry representatives say prices could rise.
When Chinese government officials released the pork stockpiled to provide adequate nutrition to the population, even in Wuhan, they initially faced empty food shelves.

The main travel season in China, called Chunyun, began during the Chinese New Year holiday, when the epidemic began in China.
Many events where large crowds can gather, such as the annual New Year festival, have been closed by national and regional governments.Private companies are also closing their stores on their own and several attractive tourist destinations such as Hong Kong's Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland have been closed.
Many Lunar New Year festivals and tourist gatherings, including the Forbidden City and the traditional temple fair, have been suspended in Beijing to prevent crowds.
Officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions extended the New Year's holiday until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong maximised its infectious disease response and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling New Year's Eve celebrations. The global retail sector has been affected by reduced or temporary closures of store opening hours.
In Europe and Latin America, store visits fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% drop.
As a result, the number of shoppers in shopping centers decreased by 33-43% in March compared to February.
Global shopping mall managers imposed additional measures, such as increasing sanitation, installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and canceling events. The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that the recession triggered by the global pandemic could push 14 to 22 million more people into extreme poverty in Latin America than if the global pandemic had not occurred.
In Wuhan in January and February 2020, at the peak of the epidemic, nearly 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are helpless at home in inland areas or stuck in Hubei province.More than 10 million Americans lost their jobs in March 2020 and applied for government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could result in 47 million job losses in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. The lockdown in India has left millions of Indian migrant workers (paid per day wages/per-wage) unemployed. A study by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian families are experiencing some form of unemployment.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British employees applied for a universal credit scheme.
The German Short-Time Workers Compensation Scheme has also been adopted by France and the UK.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, which has affected the operations of organisations as well as individuals - both employed and independent - globally.
The arts and culture sector organizations sought to maintain their (often government-funded) mission of providing access to cultural heritage in the community, maintaining the safety of their staff and the public, and supporting artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions around the world and at various levels have closed indefinitely, cancelling or delaying their exhibitions, events and performances.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly growing consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebration in Rome during the last week of the Christian Lent season.
Many dioceses have advised elderly Christians to stay home instead of coming on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, online live streaming or television, and others are holding services without getting out of their cars.
With the closure of its churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome and the emptying of Christian pilgrims in St. Peter's Square, other religious authorities have also canceled services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and chapels.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak, and subsequent closure of religious sites, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as residents of the country from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic is responsible for the most significant disaster on the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season, have either been cancelled or postponed.
"The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be ""rescheduled to a date after 2020 but not later than summer 2021"". Casinos and other gaming venues worldwide are closed and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or cancelled".
Reports of a significant increase in new sign-ups to gambling sites suggest that this has led to many gamblers moving online.
Many of the major theaters, like those on Broadway, have canceled all performances.
"Some artists continued to compose and share art via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming of concerts or creating web-based ""festivals"", where artists can perform, distribute and promote their work".
Online, the fire has spread through internet memes that are themed around the coronavirus, which are both humorous and distracting from this uncertain time.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a rise in prejudice, fear of foreigners and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and also people from hotspot areas in Europe, the US and other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, there have been reports of fear, suspicion and hostility.
Cases reported since February document racist attitudes towards groups of Chinese people around the world, where they are considered worthy of the virus or what is being done to them as just retaliation.
Anti-China sentiment has also been on the rise in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported being discriminated against based on their regional origin.
There was support for the Chinese both online and offline, and there was also support for people in the virus-affected areas.
People in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience the horrors of the COVID-19 outbreak, may be subject to suspicion and panic as the outbreak progresses in new hotspot countries. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to request a ban on Chinese people entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseKingJapaneseWon'tcome was very popular.
There are reports of increasing levels of racial abuse and attacks against Chinese people in the UK and the US as well as other Asians.
"U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a ""Chinese virus"", as critics see the phrase as racist and anti-Chinese".
Ukrainian protesters attack buses carrying Ukrainian residents and foreigners from Wuhan to Nabi Sanzhari.
Students from northeast India, which shares a border with China, who are studying in India's major cities have reportedly been subjected to harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
"The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal state unit, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese have destroyed nature and ""that is why God has taken vengeance on them"".
The Chinese Consulate in Kolkata has sharply criticized the comments in Kolkata, calling them "false".Xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents in China have increased during the pandemic.
There are other newspapers, including Paywall, that have removed them from their partial or complete coverage of the coronavirus.
Many specific publications have produced science-related works related to the outbreak that are available in open access.
Some scientists favor publishing their results quickly on some innovative server such as Bioroxive.

Laboratory testing for the respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and identify antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and designed to detect only RNA from SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and surveillance of the population.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had too few to report symptoms or who were asymptomatic.
The results of the test can be used to determine the exact mortality rate and the herd immunity of the population.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the outbreaks of the virus in their populations until March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is wide variation in how many tests have been conducted across countries.
This difference is likely to significantly affect the mortality rate in reported cases, which is likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or spit samples, can be tested using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests with throat swabs are only reliable in the first week of illness.
The virus may subsequently disappear from the throat, but may continue to grow in numbers in the lungs.
In infected people tested at week two, otherwise samples can then be taken from deep in the respiratory tract by suction catheter, or a cough-excreted object (spout) can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed in January 2020 at the Charité in Berlin, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and it formed the basis for 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test by 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical stage PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
"It searches for the common ""E"" gene in all beta coronaviruses and the characteristic RdRp gene for SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Products Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States is distributing its 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time diagnostic RT-PCR panel to public health laboratories through international reagent resources".
Unresolved results due to faulty reagents in one of three genetic tests of older versions of the test kits and a disruption of testing at the CDC in Atlanta; resulting in an average of fewer than 100 samples successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not determined to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing until then.
The trial was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.US commercial labs began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 testing available nationwide on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; collection and processing of samples must be done as required by the CDC.
The COVID-19 test in Russia was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 12 March 2020, reports were received that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in as little as 3.5 hours, thus allowing a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Similarly on 21 March 2020, Cepheid received EUA from the FDA for a test, which took approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require periodic temperature cycles, this method can give positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the U.S., and Abbott hopes to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day.One test uses a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus, and is being developed in Taiwan in the hope that it can give results in 15 to 20 minutes, just like a rapid influenza test.
"A March 2020 literature review concluded that ""the importance of chest radiography in the early stages is very low in the diagnosis, but it may be present in the data from CT [computed tomography] even before the onset of symptoms""".
Features of CT include bilateral, multilobar ground-glass opacity with a transverse, non-asymmetric and retrograde distribution.
Subpluoral dominance, crazy paving and consolidation occur with the onset of the disease.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the current outbreak site, suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less accurate, and that many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for screening or diagnosis of COVID-19"". As of March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for primary screening".
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infection in humans, to determine immunity and to monitor populations from as early as 7 days after the onset of symptoms. Evaluations can be performed by central laboratories (CLT) and point-of-care testing (PoCT).
Many essential laboratories will have high-performance automated systems capable of performing this task, but their availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT, although sequential samples may also be used to track immune response.
A single blood sample is usually taken by piercing the skin for PoCT.
Tests like the PCR method do not require a pre-processing step.On March 26, 2020, the FDA announced the names of 29 organizations that provided the agency with the required notification and are now therefore able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been authorized under an emergency use authorization by the FDA. Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits in late March 2020, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test has the capacity to take hundreds of samples in a matter of hours, and is therefore much faster than traditional PCR assays of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK learned that none of the antibody testing kits they had purchased were good enough to be used.
"Hong Kong has developed a scheme where suspected patients can stay at home, ""the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube"", he will spit in it, send it back and receive the test results shortly afterwards. The British NHS announced that they are launching a scheme on an experimental basis to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of infection by other people if the patient is in a hospital, or the need to disinfect it if an ambulance is used. A healthcare professional takes samples using appropriate precautions in a drive-through test for suspected cases of COVID-19.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most comprehensive testing of any country.The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2 that they have the capacity to conduct about 12,000 tests per day in a mobile setting, and that 10,700 people were tested in the previous week.
When the test is ordered by a doctor, the health insurance covers the costs.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, drive-in tests were conducted in many major cities.
The total number of tests completed in Germany on 26 March 2020 was unknown, as only positive cases were reported.
"An initial laboratory study revealed that at least a total of 483,295 samples had been tested up to and including the 12/2020 calendar week, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel developed and tested a method to combine samples from 64 patients to test samples together, and only further test if the combined sample was found positive. In Wuhan on 5 February 2020, a temporary emergency detection lab called BGI ""Huo-Yan"" (Chinese: 火眼, or ""Fire Eye"" in Hindi) opened in a 2,000 square meter facility, which can process more than 10,000 samples in a day".
Monitoring the construction by BGI founder Wang Jian and modeling it over 5 days showed that without the timely increase in testing capacity, cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the associated costs of dealing with quarantine would have doubled.
Huo-Yan Labs in a total of 12 cities across China, such as Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, quickly followed Wuhan Laboratory.
As of 4 March 2020, the test capacity was a total of 50,000 per day.Open source, multiplexed designs published by Origami Assays have been released that can test up to 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 tests.These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
By March, shortages and insufficient reagents had become a limitation on mass testing in the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some researchers to explore sample preparation protocols where samples were heated at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to free up RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March it was announced that the UAE is now testing more people for the coronavirus than any other country and is on track to scale up testing to reach a larger portion of the population.
"This was done through a combination of drive-through capabilities and the purchase of a population-scale mass production laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their ""Huo-Yan"" emergency detection laboratories in China)".
The lab, which was built in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first of its kind in the world to be operated outside China.
Various testing systems targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The German system of producing kits for sending to low-income countries that do not have the resources to produce their own kits was adopted by the WHO.
The German system was released on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, which delayed tests available in the US. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of testing kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet demand and recommendations for testing by health experts.
In contrast, experts say that increased testing in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.
The South Korean administration has been building capacity for testing in mostly private sector labs for years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The increased demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus created millions of test backlogs in private US labs, and put pressure on the supply of swabs and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of their testing kits.
"Test kits produced by the CDC in the United States had ""defects""; the administration then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were incorrect".
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of failure to collect samples or use the kits properly.
The Spanish ministry said that it would recall the kits that gave incorrect results, and replace them with a different kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The Czech Republic gave 80% of the test kits it purchased from China with incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be incorrect.
"Prime Minister Matovič proposed to dump them in the Danube River. Turkish Health Ministry's Ateş Kara said that the test kits that Turkey purchased from China had a ""high rate of defects"" and that they ""did not use them"". The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were not usable.
Testing and subsequent quarantine of those who tested positive and tracing of those who had contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive people resulted in positive results.
Researchers in the Italian city of Vaud, site of the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing over an entire population of 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
Almost half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and all those who were identified were quarantined.
The new infections have been completely eliminated by the control of traffic in the commune.
With aggressive tracking of people in contact, inbound travel controls, testing and quarantining, but no extreme controls such as forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets, the 2020 coronavirus global pandemic in Singapore has progressed much more slowly than in other developed countries.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened in time for the holiday break on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the global pandemic with aggressive tracing of people in contact, inbound travel controls, testing and quarantines, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more than the number of deaths had much lower death rates, probably because these countries were able to detect patients who were mild or no symptoms at all.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have limited experience with COVID-19 by national laboratories should send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Out of 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
"The column ""Percentage of tests positive"" in the chart below is influenced by the testing policy of the country".
A country that only tests hospitalized people will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country where all else being equal, all citizens are tested, symptomatic or not.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, refers to the act of cleaning a person's hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
"Regular hand washing with soap at certain ""critical moments"" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through feces or mouths".
People can also catch respiratory illnesses such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical moments of the day when hand washing with soap is important are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby's bottom or changing the nappy, before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, wash hands with ash.
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning the toilet of the child.
After your nose runs, coughs or sneezes.
After touching animals, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the hygienic practices associated with medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to keep hands clean of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who care for or work in medical food, but it is also an important procedure for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the transmission of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
Reduce infant and maternal mortality during home births.
A 2013 study found that improved handwashing habits may lead to minor improvements in height gain in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children from respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap.
This simple process can reduce the death rate from the disease by about 50%.
Measures that encourage hand washing can reduce diarrhea incidence by about a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Hand washing with soap is associated with a 48% reduction in diarrhea incidence.The single most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI) is to make hand washing with soap an automatic practice in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age. It takes the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia are the cause of death of about 3.5 million children a year.
According to UNICEF, changing to a strong practice of hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, reduce diarrhea deaths by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is integrated with other sanitation measures as part of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing protects against infectious skin diseases (impetigo) that are transmitted through direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itching, peeling skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
The five critical times of day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the spread of disease are: after using the bathroom (urinating, defecating), after cleaning the baby's bottom or changing the nappy, before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when proper handwashing techniques should be applied to prevent infection include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or brushing the nose; after touching animal waste or moving the animal; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is very low.
A 2015 survey of hand washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households used to wash their hands with soap. A 2014 survey found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 percent; the United States was in the middle at about 77 percent; and China had the lowest rate at 23 percent. Several habits-changing schemes now exist to increase hand washing with soap during a crisis.
"The ""Essential Health Care Program"" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of adequate measures to promote children's health and education".
The main focus of the national programme is to disinfect twice a year, wash hands daily with soap, brush teeth daily with fluoride.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to water increases the removal of microscopic organisms from the skin.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the solubility and increase the solubility.
Only water is ineffective skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, do not dissolve easily in water.
The cleaning is done with moderate water flow.
Nitrate soap, due to its reusable nature, can retain bacteria from previous use.
A small number of studies that targeted the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that transfer was less likely because the bacteria were washed with foam.
"The CDC still says that ""liquid soap that can be handled without the use of hands is recommended for use""".
There has been a lot of publicity among the health conscious public about antibacterial soaps.
No evidence of the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants for naturally occurring antibiotic-resistant organisms has been found to date.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial ingredients such as triclosan, which has the ability to fight off organisms in excess.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected for antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protective ingredients, sophisticated preparations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, antimicrobially active benzoic acid, and additional skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common substrate-based antibacterial soaps like Troclosan are as effective as the above-mentioned antibacterial soaps for preventing illness and removing bacteria from the hands.
The soothing hot water for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very quickly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot soap is more effective than cold soap to remove the natural oils that hold soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A non-water-based hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic that is a non-water-based hand-sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol rub hand sanitizer products (also known as alcohol-based rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are made based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, which is prepared in combination with carbomers (polymers of acrylic acid) or humicants such as concentrates such as glycerin in liquid or foam to reduce the ease of use and drying effect of alcohol.
Adding mixed hydrogen-peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity.Hand sanitizers contain at least 60 to 95% alcohol which is effective in killing germs.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizer contains 70% alcohol which kills 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) after 30 seconds of application on the hand and kills 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria after 1 minute of application on the hand. Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and relatively less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against the virus of the norovirus (or norvac) type, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Use adequate hand antiseptic or alcohol rub to dry or dry both hands.
The liquid, foam or gel is rubbed on the front and back of both hands and the middle of the fingers and the end of the end for about 30 seconds until it dries.
Wash fingertips thoroughly by rubbing both hands.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands thoroughly with hand sanitizer rubs, especially if dirty hands are found.
The increasing use of these ingredients depends on their ease of use and rapid microscopic destruction of organisms; although they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
If the formula does not contain emollients and/or skin moisturizers, frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer can cause dry skin.
The desiccating effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other lotions to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with soothing ingredients caused significantly less irritation and dryness in the skin than soap or disinfectant detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact dermatitis or hypersensitivity to alcohol or alcohol-containing substances are rare in alcohol hand rubs.
Compared to hand washing with soap and water, the lower incidence of painful contact dermatitis was a factor of attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free materials do not clean the hand organic matter, but only disinfect the hand.
Since pathogens remain on the hands, soap and water are not as effective at preventing the spread of many pathogens as effective hand sanitizers.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends heavily on ingredients and preparation and has been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol rubs in past incidents.
Most recently, benzalkonium chloride user preparations have been shown to maintain stable and incremental antimicrobial activity after application that is unlike that of alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in effectiveness after repeated use, likely due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income societies do not have the money to buy soap and instead use ashes or dirt.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Ash, like soap, is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
When soap is not available, WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap.
Proper handwashing practices recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission include the following:
Soak your hands in hot or cold running water.
Water is recommended because permanent basins can be contaminated, but water temperature does not seem to make a difference.
Rub the back of the hand, between the fingers and under the fingernails with plenty of soap to remove the soap foam.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of just water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing involves friction that removes germs from the skin and more germs are removed by long-term scrubbing.
Wash it thoroughly in the stream.
Dust in the basin can re-contaminate hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let it air dry.
Wet and damp hands are more prone to re-contamination. The areas that are most often left out are the fingers, wrists, between the fingers and under the nails.
Fingerprints and cracked nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to prevent hands from drying out; dry skin can damage the skin which can increase the risk of spreading infection.
"In developing countries where tap water and/or soap are not available, various low-cost alternatives to handwashing facilities can be developed, for example pouring water from hanging jars or suitable hollow pots and/or using ash if necessary. In situations with limited water supply (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as ""TP-Taps"" and other low-cost alternatives".
Tip-tap is a simple technique where a jug suspended by a rope and a foot-operated lever and a piece of soap are used to pour a small amount of water into the hand.
Hand drying is an essential part of hand hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public washrooms.
A growing body of research indicates that paper towels are much healthier than the electric hand dryers found in many washrooms.
A study was produced by the Paper Towel Industry European Tissue Symposium in 2008 and conducted by the University of Westminster in London to compare the levels of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and more modern jet-air hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying with a hot-air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased on average 194% on the fingers and 254% on the palms of the hands.
Drying with jet-air dryer increases the total number of bacteria on average by 42% in fingers and 15% in palms.
After hand washing and hand drying with paper towels, the total bacteria on the fingers decreased by an average of up to 76% and on the palms of the hands by up to 77%. The scientists also conducted tests to prove whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination of the site to other bathroom users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying procedure.
The jet-air dryer, which exhausted air at a sustained speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow away microorganisms from hands and units and remove potential contamination of bathroom users and the bathroom environment by up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spreads the microscopic organisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms. A study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt in 2005 evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after hand drying:
Many different types of hand dryers manufacturers exist and have compared hand dryers to paper towel dryers.
Using hand sanitizing wipes is an alternative to hand washing when travelling in the absence of soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer contains at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory in hospital settings long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered the efficacy of hand washing in preventing disease (in 1846).
There are some electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff if they forget to wash their hands.
One study found that using them reduced infection rates.
Medical hand washing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds and with sufficient soap and water or gel to remove foam from each part of the hand.
Fingers should be tied together and hands should be rubbed together.
If there is dirt under the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can live in hand water, it is important to rinse the foam well and wipe it with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water tap (and open another door to exit if necessary).
This prevents the hand from getting contaminated again from those surfaces.
"The purpose of hand washing in healthcare environments is to remove disease-causing pathogens (""bacteria"") and prevent their transmission".
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing scarcity remains unacceptable in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus causing infection with germs.
One study found that proper hand-washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-associated bloodstream infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization published a paper showing the standard hand-washing and hand-rubbing in health care settings.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines will also be available on the organization's website for public comment.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene if verification of regulatory compliance is required.
"The WHO has a ""five-minute"" rule for hand washing:"
- After exposure to blood fluid.
Before the pathogen release, and
"After patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (""medicated"" or ""anti-microbial"" soap) provides the ability to destroy hand washing ingredients".
The use of a hand scrubbing appliance that can be turned on and off without touching the hands is essential for surgical procedures, some chlorhexidine or iodine washing systems, disinfecting towels to dry hands after washing, and brushes for scrubbing and other disinfecting tools under the nails.
All jewelry must be unwrapped.
This procedure usually requires washing hands and elbows for 2-6 minutes.
Hand rubbing for long periods (10 minutes) is not necessary.
During the washing, the water from the wrist to the elbow must be prevented from spilling back into the palm.
After hand washing is completed, hands are dried with disinfected cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash hands before and after visiting a sick person or use hand antiseptic.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand-washing was from the first 20% washing and little additional benefit was found when hand-washing frequency was increased above 35%.
Washing with ordinary soap transmits bacterial infectious diseases to food at three times the rate of washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand-washing with alcohol-based detergent with hand-washing with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds each showed that alcohol-based hand-washing reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water/water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs in reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile transmission from hands.Themes may include hand washing, staff education on the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and written and oral reminders to staff to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings.
More research is needed to determine which of these improvements are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, essential way to achieve good health, even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces poses a challenge to achieving universal hand washing habits.
For example, while there are cheap options to create handwashing spots in most parts of rural Africa, there are rarely any handwashing faucets near every private or public toilet.
However, low hand washing rates can be due to deeply ingrained habits rather than a lack of soap or water/water.
Handwashing with soap campaigns and advice can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to changes in people's long-term habits.
For it to work effectively, it needs to be monitored and evaluated.
"A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based practices are effective in hand washing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of campaigning on hand washing in schools is UNICEF's ""Three Star Approach"" which encourages schools to take simple, affordable measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements".
If the minimum score is achieved, schools can reach from one to three stars.
The establishment of hand washing stations can be a part of supporting the campaign to reduce the rate of illness and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that is trying to change habits. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the recognition of handwashing emojis.
DALYs have considered several studies on the overall cost savings of handwashing in developing countries on prevention.
However, one review suggests that the promotion of handwashing with soap is relatively more affordable than other water/water and sanitation systems.
"The importance of hand washing for human health  especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as hospital mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers - two pioneers of hand hygiene first recognized this in the mid-19th century: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, English ""founder of modern nursing""".
Until then, most people believed that the infection was caused by a bad smell called miasmus.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne illness and healthcare-associated infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, in many countries, have raised awareness about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from these types of infectious diseases.
"For example, posters with ""proper hand washing techniques"" were hung in public toilets and next to hand wash sinks in office buildings and airport toilets in Germany".
"The phrase "to wash one's hands" means to show one's reluctance to take responsibility or to be an accomplice in the crime".
It originates from the Biblical passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate waved his hands away from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a language expression with more widespread use among some English-speaking communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands in an effort to cleanse the imaginary stain of madness by revealing her guilt over the crime she committed and the incitement to commit her husband.
It has also been found that people, when thinking or thinking about immoral acts, are more likely to wash their hands than others and are more likely to overvalue handwashing equipment.
"Furthermore, those who were given hand washing after such an intention were less likely to engage in other compensatory activities such as volunteering for ""cleaning""".
Religions instruct hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water/water for hand washing but not soap, is a part of the religious practice characteristic of many religions, including Baha'i, Hindu, Jewish Tevilah and Netilat Yadaim, Christian Lavo and Islamic Ozu. Religions specifically instruct hygienic hand washing after certain tasks.
Hand washing is mandatory in Hindu, Jewish and Islamic religions after using the toilet.
And, washing hands before and after every meal is mandatory in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam.
Managing workplace risks for COVID-19
Occupational risk controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health procedures to manage risks to prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and the work being done, a risk assessment of sources of exposure, the severity of disease in the community, and individual worker risk factors that may pose a risk of COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations involve minimal occupational contact with the public and other colleagues, for which general infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if sick, respiratory etiquette, and regular cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Exposure-medium-risk jobs include those jobs where COVID-19 is not known or suspected, but requires frequent or close contact with people who may have been infected due to ongoing community spread of the disease at the business location or due to international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the public, such as in schools, high-density work environments, and some overcrowded retail areas.
In addition to the primary infection prevention measures, risk management measures for this group include ventilation using advanced capacity air filters, sneezing guards and making personal protective equipment available in case of exposure to COVID-19 infected persons.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and morgue workers to be at high risk of exposure to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. The risk is further increased if these workers use aerosol-generating processes or collect or handle samples from confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases through these processes.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate for the job.
The COVID-19 outbreak in the workplace can have many effects.
Employees may be absent from work because of illness, to care for others, or for fear of possible exposure.
The nature of the business can vary in both the demand for the products and the way in which these products are purchased (e.g. shopping when not busy or through delivery or drive-through services).
Finally, shipments of goods from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted.An infectious disease preparedness and response plan may be used to guide protective measures.
The plans address various workplace and job-related risk levels, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community exposure, and personal risk factors of employees such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also described the controls needed to address those risks and plans to prepare for the situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
The objectives of the outbreak response include reducing infection among workers, protecting those at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse impacts on other organizations in their supply chains.
The severity of disease in the community where the business is located affects the responses received.
The stepwise form of hazard control is a structure that is widely used to control occupational safety and health performance.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, then administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating workers from work-related risks without relying on employee behavior, and this can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work policies or procedures that require action by the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some exposures.
All PPE must be selected based on the risk to the worker, properly fitted as applicable (e.g. respirator), consistently and appropriately worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced, and properly opened, cleaned and stored or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have minimal occupational contact with the public and other colleagues.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if ill, providing respiratory etiquette including face covering during sneezing and coughing, tissue and litter boxes, telecommunications if necessary or preparing for staggered shifts, discouraging employees from using other people's tools and materials, and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Rapid detection and isolation of potentially infected persons is an essential step to keep workers, customers, interviewers and others safe in the workplace.
All employees with symptoms of severe respiratory illness are advised by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stay home, as long as they are free of fever, fever markers, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretics or other symptom-modifying medications, and should relax sick leave policies, which allow employees to stay home to care for an ill family member, and employees should be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, moderate-risk jobs of exposure include those jobs where COVID-19 is not known or suspected, but requires frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community-disseminated disease at the business location or recent international travel to a location where the person has a large COVID-19 outbreak.
For this and for higher risk groups, engineering controls include installing high-performance air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic snow guards, and setting up a drive-thru window for customer service that requires critical controls. For this and for higher risk groups, administrative controls include encouraging employees to stay at home or in confined spaces, providing face-to-face meetings to be held virtually, introducing training on the impact of COVID-19 on staff, eliminating the use of personal contact equipment in public places where they are not at risk, providing a safe work environment and providing them with a safe and secure work environment, providing training on how to maintain a healthy face or face mask, and providing regular training on how to maintain contact with people who are at low risk of COVID-19.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill on board, appropriate controls to protect the crew and other passengers include keeping the sick person 6 feet away from others, assigning a staff member to serve the sick person, and providing the sick person with a face mask or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with tissue when sneezing or coughing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when responding to a sick passenger's call or when touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and additional personal protective equipment should probably be used if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or shortness of breath.
Gloves and other discarded items should be discarded in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial vessels, including pleasure boats and other passenger vessels, risk controls include postponing travel if ill, isolating oneself, and immediately notifying the ship's medical center if someone develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be in the quarantine room of the person being isolated.In the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends that if an infected person enters a school building, regardless of the community transmission of the disease, it be closed for a short period of time for cleaning or disinfection.
When there is a minimum to moderate degree of disease spread in the public, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as cancelling field trips, rallies and other large gatherings, such as physical education or eating in a group music class or cafeteria; increasing the distance between desks, separating office commute and holiday times, limiting unnecessary appointments, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When the disease is prevalent in the local community, additional school closures may be considered as a social distancing strategy.The health risks of law enforcement personnel performing routine daily activities are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must contact people who are confirmed to have or suspect to have COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If workers come into close contact during the hazard, their duty belts and equipment should be cleaned and disinfected using a household cleaning spray or wipe before re-use, and evidence management procedures should be followed to control and discard used PPE.
OSHA considers certain health care and death-related services workers to be at high or ultra-high risk of exposure.
High-risk jobs for exposure include healthcare providers, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who come into contact with patients known or suspected to have COVID-19.
If workers perform aerosol-producing procedures, or collect or move samples from patients known or suspected to have COVID-19, they become at high risk of exposure.
Aerosol-producing procedures include tube insertion, cough initiation procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and sampling by inserting tests or instruments.
High-risk, death-related jobs include workers involved in preparing bodies for people who were known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; this becomes a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for people in this risk group include quarantine rooms for patients known or suspected to have COVID-19, including when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and mortuary environments.
Samples should be handled according to Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that arriving patients be isolated in separate waiting areas based on whether they are suspected to have COVID-19. OSHA recommends respirators in addition to other PPE for people working within 6 feet of those known or suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 and for people performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, a comprehensive, written respiratory safety program, including health screenings, training and medical examinations, requires the use of NIOSH-approved N95 or better filtering facial respirators.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort.WHO does not recommend coveralls, as COVID-19 is not spread through bodily fluids, but rather is a respiratory illness.
WHO recommends a surgical mask for screening personnel only at entry points.
WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shield, gown and gloves for those collecting, caring for, or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-producing methods.
If an aerosol-producing process is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given the global inadequacy of PPE supply, WHO recommends using telemedicine, physical distancing such as transparent windows to reduce the need for PPE, and allowing only those directly involved in caring to enter a room with a single COVID-19 patient, using only PPE necessary for specific tasks, continuing to use it without removing respirators while caring for multiple patients with the same disease, allowing monitoring and coordination of the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the wearing of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 global pandemic is an event that has made global human interaction and our responsibilities to one another clear.
We have no precedent for its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on universal compassion, cooperation and community building at the heart of this organization.
The intimacy, trust and care we have seen among all our colleagues through email, calls and chat is a remarkable testament to the incredible people we are fortunate enough to work with.
I am extremely grateful and proud to have you all as my colleagues.
Last week someone shared their praise for our work with me.
They reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to see Wikipedia at this moment and how powerful a symbol it is to have this important resource online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether you're keeping the sites running or paying our colleagues or keeping our communities safe, whatever you do.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, now more than ever.
It's a moment where not only what we do, but how we do it will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will be making some significant changes in the way we work together starting this coming week.
We can adjust our schedule to suit our needs.
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our approach and set a schedule for the coming days and months.
We thought that was the appropriate response to the situation we were facing and we considered in that conversation the best way to sustain the company at this time.
Most of us wanted to relieve stress and support our cause in the long run.
If you need to dial back, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors, and contract workers:
Until further notice, our daily work expectations will be around 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week.
We are not announcing a holiday - if you are able to work more normal hours, the mission can use you.
But right now, the world is uncertain, and whether you need to care for a loved one or pick up groceries or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not watching your time.
Don't work if you're sick.
Needless to say, but we're saying it.
No sick leave or PTO needed - just tell your manager and help your team revise calendars and schedules, to ensure key areas of work are covered.
(If you are positive for COVID-19, please let Brian at T&C Ops know so that T&C can help and ensure that your situation receives proper attention from the authorities.)
People who work by the hour will be paid full wages.
We have said it before, and we pledge again to honor our commitment to our contractors and our hourly colleagues.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This includes if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll help you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress from the world around us in a certain direction.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We want you to stay in touch with your manager so we know what to expect and can adjust accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are things we must do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) perform essential tasks that may require additional support.
We will initiate a process with all our departments to assess current targets and shift our focus to collaborate on what is necessary for our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, just we all focus on the most important projects.
Take it easy now, you won't get hurt later.
We do not plan to work twice as long to make a living after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to finish the job on time, which is not realistic anymore.
We recognize that the situation has changed, and where appropriate, we will work to set new targets and timelines.
What about APP?
To align with our new realities and expectations of daily working hours, we also want to adjust the deadline for delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will give employees more time to budget to prioritize essential work, take care of themselves and their loved ones, while also meeting the demands of those who want or need to work on reduced schedules over the next few weeks.
This extension of time limit greatly reduces the workload of the current plan and the pressure on the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and we will update delegates and teams as soon as possible on the next steps as we receive confirmation.
I thank the APP team for their leadership in this regard.
Office conditions, contact and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But out of great caution, we hired a team of virulent cleaners to disinfect all surfaces in our San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution of hospital-grade quality to disinfect every surface and lobby and elevator banks that entered our floor.
The building is deploying its own service obligation protocol using products that help keep their tenants safe.
We are comfortable that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located on a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC-based staff members.
Last week our DC office moved to a fully remote setup in line with our guidance to San Francisco.
Some of our NYC-based colleagues know that we were also discussing leasing a space in Brooklyn.
The talks are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time remote colleagues know that this can be a compromise, and wanted to give you some advice:
Limit the length of the meeting to one or two hours if it is too long.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how to break them up into smaller sessions over several days.
Explain the meeting clearly, have an agenda and send the materials in advance.
With tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make live collaboration and connectivity easier, turn video off by default.
Have a lead to facilitate each meeting, have someone monitor questions in the chat and keep an eye on the list of speakers, and have someone take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to tech support.
Use your wellness reimbursement for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the tasks you've been assigned.
The HR Operations Management Team is looking at webinar-based ergonomics guidance to help grow distributed work across the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community donors to cancel public events such as the Wikimedia-funded Editaathon, until WHO declares the pandemic over.
We inform them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to complete their agreed-upon donation activities and that no one will be penalized for delaying or modifying these targets.
In the coming weeks we will be inspiring additional guidance for Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The global community as a whole seems to have both the depression for the general mood disruption, but at the same time the ability to focus on their own communities, and the clarity to get rid of it, at Wikimedia and elsewhere.
In the coming days CRT is working to create a page on the Meta-Wiki, to provide a place for the public to monitor the impact and follow our interactions with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates and answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are all united in this situation and will help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to search for information from this email, and find other vital information about COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with workers currently living in the most affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow or coverage challenge, or if you need help with anything else, please feel free to let us know and work with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and coordination as needed.
If you have confidential or sensitive matters, please email Bryan Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a neglect of our duty and responsibility.
It's a recognition that we're probably going to have to adapt to our jobs and responsibilities in ways that we haven't done in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to work, provide the support our movement needs, and provide the services the world depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
Now is the time to support each other and make room for the important work that is to come in the weeks and perhaps even months ahead.
We need your cooperation to do that, and we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can all be healthy when the need arises.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, the CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Hime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Hime V, Janine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor that binds to the cell surface (cell membrane) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 also opposes the work of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (((1-7) making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry site for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme that resides on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal colectin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, whose active site for enzyme activity is uncovered on the cell surface of the lung and other tissues.
The exogenous domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called shades, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly bound to the cell membranes of alveoli of type II of the lung, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells of most organs, and smooth muscle cells of the arteries.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance to ACE.
ACE divides the hormone angiotensin I into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 isolates the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) from angiotensin II and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also differentiate several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 regulates membrane exchange of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with heartburn.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus responsible for SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike S1 proteins to the cell surface in the enzymatic domain of ACE2 leads to endocytosis and displacement of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes located within the cell.
This entry process also requires the priming of S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is currently under investigation as a potential therapeutic. This has helped some to speculate that reducing levels of ACE2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing evidence-based ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that ""compared to controls, the risk of pneumonia was significantly reduced by 34% with the use of ACE inhibitors""".
"In addition, ""the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, particularly in patients with high risk of pneumonia, stroke and heart failure".
"The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the effect was less than that of a potent overall risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung injury and has been shown to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory symptoms.
In humans, the half-life of rhACE2 is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes, while the duration of effect (stability) is 24 hours.
It appears from several findings that rhACE2 may be promising in individuals who cannot tolerate class I renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or have diseases where angiotensin II circulation is elevated. Intracytoplasmic rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
"b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed for contact identification in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying a person who has been in contact with an infected person (""Contact"").
Numerous applications were developed or proposed with official government support in some areas and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructure has been developed for the development of contact tracing apps.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially regarding systems that work based on the geolocation of app users.
Relative unauthorized access options include the use of Bluetooth signals to log a user's capture on another cellphone.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has launched an app in conjunction with Alipay that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 Chinese cities.
The app was developed by a local IT group, published as open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia launched Stop Corona!, a Bluetooth-based app that aims to detect the symptoms of a potentially infected person and provide a quick response by healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
The app was pending approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store as of 14 April 2020.
"On April 12, the government announced that the Connection Search app is in the advanced stages of development and will be available to work in a few weeks. Similar apps ("StopCovid") are planned in Ireland and France".
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia is planning to launch a geofencing app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow, to ensure they don't leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor in the Department of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, lists a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and lack of functionality if app adoption is limited to a small segment of the population.
"Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has set restrictions on which types of companies can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting them to only ""official"" or otherwise reputable companies".
Google and Amazon have similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concerns in the context of the implications of surveillance of people using coronavirus apps, in particular, whether surveillance infrastructures designed to deal with the coronavirus global pandemic will be terminated once the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
The company announced eight conditions for the government project:
"Surveillance must be ""lawful, necessary and proportionate""".
There will be a sunset section to enhance observation and surveillance;
Data use for COVID-19 purposes must be restricted;
Information security and anonymity must be protected and evidence-based protection demonstrated;
Digital surveillance was needed to stop the outbreak of discrimination and marginalization;
Sharing of any data with third parties should be made clear in law;
Citizens should have the right to protest against abuse and protection against abuse.
"All ""relevant stakeholders"" including public health experts and marginal groups will be required to participate significantly. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Oehne Grünzen) (RSF) have issued checklists".
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the problem of constant surveillance by removing tracking from the operating systems of their devices when they are no longer needed.
Some countries used network-based location-based surveillance instead of apps, which eliminates both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid surveillance.
In Israel, network-based detection was allowed.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location information have significant potential privacy concerns.
However, not all systems of a central server require access to personal location data; multiple privacy-preserving systems have been developed that use a central server only for intercommunication (see section below).
An appless system was used in South Korea for contact tracking.
Instead of using a deployed app, the system gathered tracking information from multiple sources, including data from mobile device tracking and card transaction data, and combined them to send notifications via text message to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to warn of potential exposure, the government has made location information publicly available, allowing for some things due to far-reaching changes in data privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in the country.
Some countries, including Germany, considered using both centralized and privacy-protecting systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been released.
Detecting privacy-protected communications is a well-established concept, with research dating back to at least 2013 as a practical part of education. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as recording the proximity of another cellphone user using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that has both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single code of conduct. The decentralized codes of conduct include privacy-sensitive codes and procedures for decentralized privacy-preserving proximity identification (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact numbers, CEN), mobile contact identification (PACT), and others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable information never leaves the device and all happens within the matching device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or path intersection data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on a white paper titled Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic, which was published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company also founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace leverages secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities without compromising on the privacy of their information.
On 5 April 2020, the Universal TCN Alliance was founded by a group of groups who came together on essentially the same approaches and large-scale sequential behavioral codes that were required, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling universal interoperability of identifying and alerting apps, a key aspect of mass adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had an open-source BlueTrace protocol being used by its official app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms respectively, announced an initiative to track people in contact, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth low energy technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They also released details of the key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be available in three stages:
To enable governments to create privacy-preserving official apps to detect the coronavirus, roll-out of tools
Integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android: Google and Apple plan to address take-up and continuous monitoring issues by first distributing the system through an operating system update and then removing it in the same manner when disaster strikes.
B-drug repositioning (also known as re-profiling, re-purposing, re-doing, or re-changing a drug to a palliative) is the use of an approved drug to treat a disease or condition that is different from the one it was originally designed to treat.
This is a path of scientific research currently being pursued to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convoluted plasma infection.SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 drug-targeted proteins each with multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable project to develop effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papine-like proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, S proteins and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussain A. A., et al. studied various candidate compounds that were optimized and analyzed in their pre-clinical studies for similarity of candidate skeletons by the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug to recommend clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine were among the four drugs that will be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is only authorized as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but unable to participate in clinical trials under the European Union.
"CDC states that ""the use, dosage, or stability of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection"" has not yet been established".
"The doctors said they were using the drug because they had no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on using chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large-scale research is underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for preventive use.
"Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show favipiravir to be ""clearly effective""".
In the four-day interval, 35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative, while 45 patients who did not have it had a duration of illness of 11 days.
In a study of 240 pneumonia patients conducted in Wuhan, half were given favipiravir and half were given umiphenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is insufficient and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy medicines from Japan to stockpile and use the military to supply medicines to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has proposed to the Trump administration about buying the drug.The drug may be less effective in cases of severe illness where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
"A study of the combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) concluded that ""no benefit was observed""".
Drugs were designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that would bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2.There is criticism within the scientific community about using resources to change the purpose of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO includes lopinavir/ritonavir in the international mutual support trial.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple phyllo-, pneumo-, paramyco- and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious disease and infection.
Several preliminary pre-trial studies indicate that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two trials conducted by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and the other for people with severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of vitamin C to provide intravenous for hospitalized and critically ill individuals with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began trials for the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) in Japan is planning a clinical trial for alvesco (cyclosonide) of taejin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, to treat pre-symptomatic patients with the novel coronavirus.
A trial of a variant of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway in 200 critical, hospitalized patients in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the efficacy of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently investigating the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or who do not have an effective contraceptive method, are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to issue guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study investigating the use of anoxaparin sodium in a preventive and palliative dose on 300 patients was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, routinely scientific attention has been focused on the reformulation of approved antitoxins that were developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines.
Umifenvir: Umifenvir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the Chinese 7th edition guidelines.
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially novel uses for COVID-19 treatment include:
Tsilizoumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China.
b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a projected vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several attempts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect an effective vaccine to protect against the virus, SARS-CoV-2, to be available in less than 18 months.
In April, there were five vaccine candidates in the Phase I safety trial.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread across the world in 2020, which led to substantial investment and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many companies are using the released genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was said that the conditions for CEPI initiative to develop a vaccine are speed, production capacity, large scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were working on R&D in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform objectives that have advanced in Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Cancino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccinated individuals are in early stages of improvement of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute) and 37 others have been reported, but these are all from little publicly available information (presumed to be planned).
Phase I-II trials conduct preliminary safety and immunity trials and are usually randomized, placebo-controlled and conducted at multiple sites while determining more specific, effective doses.
Phase III trials, including efficacy of vaccine trials to prevent disease and control groups, typically involve more participants, while monitoring adverse effects at optimal drug doses.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (as confirmed in early April 2020), 74 had not yet been evaluated in humans (still under ""preclinical"" studies)".
Around 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecularly bound vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to induce immune responses.
Around 24 January 2020, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-Intervac) at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada announced that it would begin work on a vaccine with the aim of starting human trials in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies led by Hanneke Schuitemaker announced that they had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen is developing the Seva vaccine in collaboration with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent Bio Solutions announced a partnership in manufacturing with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, Oncogen Laboratories in Romania published a short paper on a vaccine design of similar technology used for cancer neonogen vaccination therapy.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting the trial.
On 27 February 2020, GeneRex subsidiary NewGenerex Immuno-Oncology announced that it was launching a vaccine project to develop an LI-K peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to develop a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans within 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced their plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around 10th March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it has merged with Novavax Inc.
In developing and producing a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans to conduct preclinical trials and Phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working on 11 isolates and that it would take at least 1.5 to 2 years to develop a vaccine even at a fast pace.
On 12 March 2020, MedicaGo, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like molecule partially funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is under laboratory research with a human trial planned in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had proposed to give Kurivac a "big money" for a monopoly on the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162, which is currently in pre-clinical trials, and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, an Italian biotech company called Takis Biotech announced that they will have results of pre-clinical trials in April 2020 and that their final vaccine candidate could be tested in humans in the autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in France announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a research consortium for a COVID-19 vaccine, involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
CEPI's other investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun testing six different vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-developing RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the order from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical immunity against COVID-19, including numerous vaccine candidates from Canadian organizations and universities such as the University of Saskatchewan and MedicaGo initiatives.
"At the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for the development of COVID-19 vaccines and plans to establish a national ""vaccine bank"" for several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak".
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the trial of a potential COVID-19 vaccine on mice called PittCoVacc, stating that ""SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines cleared by MNA had strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that became apparent as early as week 2 after vaccination"".
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced plans for a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
DNA will be engineered using bacteriophages to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like molecules, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a collaboration of cloud computing companies from Amazon, Microsoft and Google, created a unified resource for the US government, industry and three universities to gain access to supercomputers from IBM.
Some inhibitors have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Efforts are underway to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers for an additional randomized trial in Australia.
There is a possibility that vaccines under development will not be safe or effective.
Preliminary research evaluating vaccine efficacy in COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human mammals indicates the need for biosecurity-level 3 control levels and international coordination to ensure standardised safety practices for managing live viruses.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health organizations around the world.
When the MERS outbreak occurred, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for developing vaccines and immunizations against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that had completed initial clinical trials in humans and three more are underway, all of which are viral-vector vaccines, two adenoviral-vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and a vaccine was already available.
The patents mentioned in various social media posts relate to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
B'coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases are mild, some cases can progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is primarily spread to humans through small spit particles caused by coughing, sneezing or speaking during close contact.
When spit particles are produced during exhalation, they usually fall to the ground or surface rather than being spread over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching contaminated surfaces.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days of onset of symptoms, although it is likely to spread before symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease. The ideal method of diagnosis is by real-time reversal transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs.
Those suspected of having the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others recommending their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or may have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Relatively uncommon, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may occur.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were seen with a percentage variation.
Some cases in China were initially only reported as chest squeezes and chest palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multi-organ disability and death.
This is called the germ phase.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop within 11.5 days of infection.Reports indicate that not all infected will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in infection is not yet fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may play a role in the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who are asymptomatic is currently unknown and being studied, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases were asymptomatic while in hospital.
On 1 April, China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases; 130 (78%) of 166 infected people that day were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both saliva and saliva can carry a large number of viruses.
Speaking out loudly produces more spit particles than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that small droplets can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) when coughing without a face covering.
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that bioaerosol transmission is possible and that air collectors placed in the outer hallways of people's homes gave positive samples of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can convert respiratory emissions into airborne particles and thus cause airborne dispersion.
Although there are concerns that it can spread through feces, the risk is thought to be low.The virus is most contagious when symptoms are present in humans; it may be possible to spread before symptoms become apparent, but the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads but one person typically infects two to three people.The virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable on cardboard for up to one day, plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and 99% copper for up to four hours.
It varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents can also be effective when used correctly; soap products break down the virus' fatty protective layer, inactivating it and releasing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical antibiotic), are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken between two days after the start of hospital admission.
The first sample of five of the six patients showed the highest virus load and the second sample of the sixth patient showed the highest virus load on the second day.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three cases of pneumonia associated with a team of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All of the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in household soap, which bursts its protective bubble. The original SARS-CoV is closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
The lungs are the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found in abundance in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
"The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called ""spike"" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 to enter host cells".
Acute cardiac injury was reported in 12% of infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe cases.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is higher due to systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disorders during the development of the disease, but severe myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors travel rapidly to the heart and are involved in cardiac activity.
Thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been reported in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be associated with poor prognosis.Autopsies of individuals who died from COVID-19 have shown diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and lymphocytes with inflammatory infiltrates, in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 tends to move to the epithelial cells - ACE2 - connecting the respiratory tract, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells in COVID-19 patients have been found to be associated with inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and recruitment of severe lung pathology.
Autopsy reports of lymphocytic infiltrate.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The ideal method of testing is using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, nasal swabs or spit samples may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests are available, but these require two blood samples taken at two-week intervals and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the strain of coronavirus and release genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infection and identify whether a person has been infected in the past) were in the pipeline for development, but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience in testing has shown only 60 to 70% accuracy.
On 21 March 2020, the FDA approved the first topical breast cancer test for use in the United States later that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University recommend methods for detecting infection based on diagnostic characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral, multilobular ground-glass opacity with a marginal, heterogeneous and retrograde distribution is common in primary infection.
Subpulcular predominance, irregular paving (lobelar septal replenishment by variable alveolar filling) and fusion may occur as the disease progresses.
Little information is available on the pathophysiology and microscopic lesions of COVID-19.
The main pathological data of the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: Pluria, pericarditis, lung consolidation and pulmonary edema are also seen.
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinucleated monster cells
Severe pneumonia: Damaged dispersed alveolar (DAD) with dispersed alveolar discharge.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia sarano: organization of secretions in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and practicing proper respiratory hygiene and not touching eyes, nose or mouth with bare hands.
The CDC recommends that mouth and nose tissue be removed when coughing or sneezing and that the inside of the elbow be used if no tissue is found.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public to limit infection by asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies are designed to reduce contact of infected individuals with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distancing instructions also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.
"There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. Since no vaccine is expected until before 2021, the key part of COVID-19 control is to try to reduce the peak of the pandemic, known as ""flattening the curve"".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or if their hands are visibly dirty, before eating, and after runny nose, coughing or sneezing.
It further recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol content when only soap and water are not available. WHO provides two formulas for local production in places where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available.
The antimicrobial activity in these preparations is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide alcohol is used to kill bacterial spores; it is ""not an active substance for hand antiseptic""".
Glycerol is added as a humicant.
People are driven by supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and assisting other severely affected organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a normal mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory dysfunction, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive care may be effective in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Intensive care physicians and pulmonologists in the United States have organized treatment recommendations from various organizations into a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for primary use.
Caution should be taken to reduce the risk of virus transmission, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures such as intubation or hand ventilation that can create airborne particles.
For healthcare professionals serving people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping people in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR), in addition to using evidence-based warnings, touch warnings, and airborne warnings.The CDC outlines guidelines for using personal protective equipment (PPE) during the global pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: PPE gown, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. Respirator (instead of face mask) is recommended if available.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments but the FDA has approved masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but efficacy against certain organic materials is not guaranteed for label-specific use.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face coverings or homemade masks as a last resort.
Most cases do not have COVID-19 severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a small percentage of cases do.
The type of respiratory aid for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure for hospitalized people is being actively studied, with some evidence that intubation with a high-flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure can be avoided.
It is not known whether either of these will lead to the same benefits for those with severe illness.
Some doctors choose to keep it through invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of airborne particles compared to a high-flow nasal cannula. Severe events are most common in older adults (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limits the ability of health systems to deal with the sudden surge in the number of cases of COVID-19 that are severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical assistance of ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people with COVID-19 in hospital end up in ICU.
Mechanical ventilation is more complicated as COVID-19 develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Pressure control mode and high PEEP enabled ventilators are required to maximize oxygen delivery, while ventilators are required to reduce the risk of lung injury and pneumothorax.
High levels of PEEP may not be found on older ventilators.
A potential treatment study was started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, several drugs undergoing testing are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced trials.
Antiviral medicines may be tested in people with serious illnesses.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted provisional approval for convective plasma as an experimental treatment where a person's life is in serious or immediate danger.
It has not been subjected to the necessary clinical studies to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to use surveillance data to identify 'close contacts' and the potential risk of infection as a result.
Each user can check the status of three other users.
The app not only recommends self-quarantine when a potential risk is detected, but also alerts local health officials.Big data analytics of cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to monitor infected people and contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to monitor mobile phone data of individuals suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measures were taken to protect persons who may have come into contact with infected citizens and to enforce quarantine.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telecom shared integrated phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency, for the purpose of preventing the spread of the virus and research.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to identify quarantine violators.
"Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Galera said mobile phone operators told him that ""40% of people are moving anyway""".
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
Also, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called for a global call for creative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may feel ill from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""Increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic recession are a perfect disaster for the mental health and wellbeing of people""".
Like other common upper respiratory illnesses such as the common cold, the disease can progress mildly with few or no symptoms.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, but severe or life-threatening cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Data on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS suggest that pregnant women may be at risk of severe infection with COVID-19, but data on COVID-19 are lacking.
In the majority of severely affected individuals, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which can lead to respiratory dysfunction, septic shock or multi-organ disability.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Among those hospitalized with COVID-19, 6% had abnormal blood pressure, especially increased duration of prothrombin, while 4% had abnormal kidney function.
Transaminases have been reported in approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19.
According to the same report, the time between onset of symptoms and death, including five hospitalizations, was ten days.
However, patients transferred to ICU had a seven-day interval between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the interval from the onset of early symptoms to death with a full six to 41 day period was 14 days.
A study by China's National Health Commission (NHC) found that the male mortality rate was 2.8% while the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
Autopathic histopathological examinations of lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage, including the release of cellular fibromycoxide in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The picture of the lungs is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Cardiac arrest or increased troponin levels were associated with heart damage in 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China.
According to March data in the United States, 89% of those hospitalized had a pre-existing condition.Economic and medical availability in a region can also affect mortality.
The estimates of mortality from this disease differ not only due to regional differences but also due to systemic difficulties.
The undercounting of mild cases may overstate the mortality rate.
However, the fact is that deaths are the result of past infections which means that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than nonsmokers and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die. Concerns have been raised about the long-term consequences of the disease.
Hong Kong hospital authorities noted a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans indicated organ damage.
It can also lead to post-rehabilitation post-intensive care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether past infections confer effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Other coronaviruses have a very high probability of showing immunity based on their behaviour but in those cases, recovery from COVID-19 has been reported after a positive test result for the coronavirus.
These cases are feared to be due to a more permanent worsening of infection than re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and of animal origin, through spillover infection.
The exact source is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, reported the first date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.
Official publications from WHO said that the first onset of symptoms was on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to determine the death rate.
These numbers vary by region, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 to deaths due to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and U07.2 to deaths due to clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 due to laboratory-unconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Death-to-case ratio refers to the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases in a given period.
Based on Johns Hopkins University data, the worldwide death-to-infection ratio was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of diagnosed persons who have died from the disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of infected persons (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died from the disease.
These statistics have no time frame and follow a specific population from infection to diagnosis.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
The epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Casiglione DiAdda, a small village of 4,600 people, where 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelet, the disease was spread through carnival festivals and among younger people, causing relatively few deaths, and all COVID-19 deaths may not have been officially classified.
In addition, the German healthcare system is not in disarray.
In the Netherlands, blood donors may have about 3% of the antibodies as assessed.
69 people (0.004%) of the population have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate is different for men and women.
Studies in China and Italy have shown higher mortality rates among men.
Men are at their highest risk in their 50s, and the gap between men and women ends in their 90s.
The mortality rate in China was 2.8% among men and 1.7% among women.
The exact causes of these gender differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be involved.
Gender-based immunological differences, the relatively low prevalence of smoking among women, and the development of co-morbidities in men at younger ages than women, such as high blood pressure, may have contributed to higher mortality rates among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
Since April 2020, the US government has not monitored data on gender of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women and are at high risk of exposure to the virus.
"On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease will be ""COVID-19""".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to specific geographic locations (e.g., China), animal species, or human populations, in line with international recommendations for naming with the aim of preventing kalimalephan.The virus that causes COVID-19 is named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"WHO uses additional ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""virus responsible for COVID-19"" in public communication".
"Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as ""coronavirus""".
"During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as ""coronavirus"" and ""Wuhan coronavirus""".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory illness as the provisional names for the virus and disease, in accordance with 2015 guidelines in terms of use of virus and disease location.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers are printing parts for healthcare components such as nasal swabs and ventilators.
In one example, when a ventilator valve was urgently needed in an Italian hospital and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required timeframe, a local start-up company tested the manufacturer's product construction and produced the required 100 valves overnight.
Since the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and rumors about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease have emerged and spread rapidly online.
Humans are thought to be capable of spreading the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find any evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is no approved drug or vaccine for the treatment of this disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is ongoing by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the WHO launched a "mutually supported trial" to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of four existing antiviral compounds with the highest promise of efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several companies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being explored.
First, researchers aim to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, whether inactivated or dead, is aimed at eliminating the immediate immune response of the human body to a new infection by COVID-19.
The second strategy, subunit vaccine, aims to develop a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to specific subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study targeted the S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, innovative approaches to vaccine development).
Experimental vaccines from either of these strategies must be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The genetic code of the virus that causes the disease is in the vaccine, which does not cause harm to replicate.Antibody-dependent growth has been suggested as a potential challenge to vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are underway since April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating treatments already approved for the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most of the research in China is being done on antiviral drugs for different uses, and nine Phase III trials on remdesivir across different countries are due to report by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the diagnostic development of COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates was prepared in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta-containing lopinavir/ritonavir.
There is experimental evidence of efficacy by remdesivir in March 2020.
Diagnostic improvement was observed in patients treated with the experimental drug remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, the research needs to be reviewed.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram of the drug, notes that doubling the dose can be extremely dangerous and fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorizations for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine based on the discretion of physicians treating individuals with COVID-19. The Chinese 7th edition guideline also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir in the context of COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further vivo studies after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that preparation of the primary spike protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 to enter through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
There are serious limitations to studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin that have prevented the medical community from taking these therapies without further study.Oceltamir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine disruption can be a critical condition in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine-fast-release inhibitory properties. Tosilisizumab has been included in the medical guidelines of the National Health Commission of China after completing a small study.
It is undergoing a Phase 2 randomized trial nationally in Italy after seeing positive results in people with severe disease.
Blood testing for serum ferritin to detect cytokine disruption means preventing the progression of the disease, which is thought to cause death in some infected people.
In 2017 CAR T cell therapy was approved by the FDA for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different factor based on a past-related case study.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tosilisizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Refined and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have recovered from COVID-19 are being explored as a vaccine-free method of passive immunization to those who need it.
The technique was tested for SARS with unconfirmed results.
Viral inactivation is the anticipated process of specialised approaches whereby passive antibody therapy can mediate immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other processes such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of generated monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
Production of convalescent serum, which consists of a fluid portion of blood taken from recovered patients and can be amplified to rapidly synthesize these virus-specific antibodies.
Coronavirus diseases, a class of closely related syndromes
