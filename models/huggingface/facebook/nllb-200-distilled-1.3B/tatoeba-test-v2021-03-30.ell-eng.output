Tell her we don't want to go.
They've located her.
I had nothing to do.
We're both very hungry.
We have a lot of friends.
I don't think I'm ready for the exam.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
They'll fix it.
We don't have school tomorrow.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
I like to dance.
It's going to be okay.
Why didn't you come?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We had no secrets.
Why are you learning French?
I have a green shirt.
You're way faster than me.
Tom now lives in Australia.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him ?
Give it to Tom.
Peter is in love with Jane.
Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow that.
- Good morning, you.
Do you like juice?
You look disappointed.
Tom knows all about them.
Did you get any sleep ?
Tom is a crazy kid.
That's right.
We laugh a lot.
Tell me what you're taking for the exam.
I think two languages are not enough.
I was wondering if I could borrow your car for tonight.
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter's a nurse.
I think we should tell them.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I drive to church.
You're a lot smarter than me.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write it all down.
Germany is in central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's coming home at 3:00.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm out of work.
I won't lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom is teaching me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
You find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Raw fish is not my cup of tea.
Sit down, please.
You got anyone ?
This is a student of Yutsu High School.
You'll see.
I'm not satisfied with that.
They lost again.
Tom would do anything for you.
- Is he all right? - Yeah.
What's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I ask where you work?
Can someone explain this to me?
Who is she?
We have to tell him.
His jokes are really killing me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do this right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We painted the house green.
The time and place of the meeting have been determined.
Tom is here.
How are things in Boston?
I just got promoted.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please close the door.
Garlic is good for your health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary he had to do it.
What would you tell her to do?
She's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'm going to stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I passed out.
I wish I wasn't Canadian.
All that glitters is not gold.
I asked Tom to play guitar.
It's ringing my phone.
He threw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist ?
Tom is a head taller than me.
Where can we buy it?
It's now 2:30.
Everybody knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was in his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadian.
Whose is this?
Tom forgot his suitcase on the train.
They killed our cattle.
My name is not Kuzey.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it on.
The phone's ringing.
Tom lives in Boston.
Thomas lives in a hippie community.
The water's hot.
You need to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom wouldn't touch them.
It was an emergency.
You're wearing expensive earrings.
Has anyone come ?
Tom is the only Canadian here.
Tom will live.
It was too late.
Those aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canadian?
People today attach more importance to popular culture than ever before.
Tom is no longer my friend.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you dye your hair?
Did Tom see you?
We love each other.
I walk every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
Did you shoot him?
We may need a few.
That's a suggestion.
How was your vacation?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them to dinner.
I'm here, we have a guest.
I'm warning you.
I'll try to find it for you.
What's your name?
I'm unemployed too.
Tom's house is completely destroyed.
Tom grabbed Mary.
It's from France.
Why are you so angry?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who this is?
Did you see the baseball game on TV last night?
Mary took a picture of her mother with her cell phone.
I wanted to die.
I don't care if he comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not about money.
Would you like to see them?
You ruined him.
We've learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we've forgotten how to live like people.
I learned a lot.
We don't trust the outside world.
Tell her I'm busy.
I won't be long.
We need to find out what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me make my point.
I never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
You 're 18 ?
I want to work out.
Tom was alive.
Thomas' phone rang, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was outrageous.
- I guess.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek myths?
He turned 40.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a French dictionary.
The captain welcomed us.
She went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to hit on her with love poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not legible.
Tom hugged Mary.
I thought you were going to Australia to build stores.
What do you call this?
Laurie's still in school.
My office is downtown.
She has two sisters.
You're not Canadian.
I repaired Boston many years ago.
Tom questioned Mary.
Tom has a twin brother.
I'll translate it for you.
We stayed three nights in Boston.
I'm starting to find you tiresome.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom is wearing gloves.
The letter is written by the girl.
Someone screamed.
He didn't go to the lake.
He speaks French fluently.
I'm taller than you.
Have you lost the receipt?
Are you afraid of losing your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom's coming back?
Tom doesn't have red hair.
Can I borrow your headphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm not biased.
I think Tom is drunk.
Tom is your teacher.
The news made him happy.
We were enemies.
Who has it?
We have nowhere to go.

Who is she?
You've had dinner.
Convince the teacher.

How was Boston?

Tom painted the wall pink.
We're very busy right now.
Louder, please.
You're all mine.
Please breathe through your nose.
The company canceled the plan.
"Fire!" he shouted.
He worked hard.
I don't come here very often.
I'm gay, you know.
You're being gullible.
Tom is not a hero.
I'm glad I could help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys aren't mine.
That was the last customer.
Do you like white wine?
They were wrong.
I've said it before and I'll say it again.
Turn on the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like spiders.
I couldn't sleep.
Are you learning Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
That's not gonna happen again.
Russia is big.
The teacher is friendly.
You ruined it.
I'm sorry, I can't sit for very long.
I'm a Harvard graduate.
Tom died before his son was born.
Look what I can do.
There's nothing you can do.
I don't want you to tell her.
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston.
What brings you here?
I pretended to be asleep.
I won't lose!
It's a good investment.
The snow was making it difficult to see.
Don't make excuses.
Thomas bought something.
He has a little house.
The girl has a white horse.
Tom is a little jealous.
I still want to marry you.
Now is your chance.
You can pick any book you want.
Where are your dresses?
Tom is not Canadian.
I'm speaking.
The best way to learn English is to go to America.
You thought I was Canadian?
I'll be with you.
I haven't received a reply to my letter.
Can I borrow your towel?
Is everyone ready for the trip?
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
I read it.
I want to talk to Tom.
You shot him.
Tom is Turkish.
Can you subtract 16 from 10?
Keep going!

I'm going to Athens.
I know, I know.
I burst into tears.
He talks like a truck driver.
When do you study ?
He hasn't answered yet.
Where's the money?
I bet he's not telling the truth.
I don't agree with you.
No one could have imagined it.
It's going to be hard.
I want to be an actress.
When I was sick, Tom came and made me dinner.
I wish I could speak all the European languages.

They're red.
He said something.
Since I got married, I don't work anymore.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
Is that a horse or a mare?
I'm grateful for what he's done.
I'm a little tired myself.
You sure you're not imagining things?
Don't make excuses.
He walks slowly.
Come with us.
No one wants to take responsibility.
His father is Japanese?
Attention, please!
Are you sure you pressed the last button?
Tom was dangerous.
What time do they start ?
I'm a little low now.
I would think about it.
Tom is from Australia.
Where do you want to eat?
That would never happen in Boston.
I like to play the piano.
They didn't know me.
I will fight.
We all know what Tom did.
Tell her you're not ready.

Are you feeling tired?

Life is hard.
Who is Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom pushed the door.
I live here.
I hope you call back.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
- Speak more slowly.
Put the book on top of the others.
The bird is in the sky.
Tom hired Mary.
Mike, how's it going?

I want to get to the hotel before nightfall.
Are you drunk?
He tried to write a short story.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going? !
My father's away.

I don't like it, honestly.
Tom will obey.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right track.

Are you sure you pressed the last button?
It's not hard to learn English.
The date will be determined later.
No one's coming.
If you're busy, I can help you.
I have a lot of things to do.
I punished them.
Your friend's here.

I'll buy one.
I know what you mean.
If you could follow me, please.
He started talking to the dog.

Tom sent you?
Tom laughed.
I lost my pen.
How do you pronounce that word?
He saved me.
I've got an idea.
Where's the bank?
Don't get drunk, you know.
I'm looking forward to your help.
It's almost 2:30.
What is it, man?
Who knows the answers?
I read this book last week.
Tom has dark circles under his eyes.
We weren't talking about Tom.

He never forgets his money.
She's almost 20.
You have to stay.
I didn't vote.
Are you mad at Tom?
My parents live a carefree life in the country.
He lost all his money at the casino.
I love green peppers.
You made the same mistake.
She said she had a good look.
What are you gonna tell Tom?
Thomas called me names.
We're very busy right now.
I can live without water.
We've given your order the highest priority.
We make mistakes sometimes.
Could I use it?
They killed her.
My car is dirty.
I have to tell you the truth.
You never trusted me.
We don't know where Tom went.

I'm an extrovert. I'm not that kind of person.

He's in front of the door.
I think they're just going to Australia for fun.
Tom's cheeks were red.
I'm Richard. You know what?
What did you use to open it?
Would he like a reservation for a trip to Australia?

Tom will understand.
Where did he kiss you?
They know us.
Tell her you'd like to leave.
Tom helped Mary.
I had my birthday yesterday.
Tom has a Canadian passport.
Tell her I'm here.

With the rain over, the game resumed.
Tom has my keys.
He seems happy.
We've prepared well.
Were you happy?
Tom will forgive you.
You like putting me to bed, don't you?
Is it raining ?
It's too slippery.
They'll hear us.
I got up early.
We'll have to wait.
I consider him a friend.
What were you doing there?

No one understands him.
Tom doesn't have much money.
Tom grew up in Boston.
Do you have a red pencil?
Everybody knows me.
Mary believes you.
You're older than she is.
Let me make my point clearer.
I never understood that.
She's washing her head.
You're smarter than he is.
Time will tell.
I won't be there.
We didn't know who he was.
Is your car black?
I'm sending them a message.
Tom left for Boston.

I saw Tom in the library.
Tom plans to stay in Boston until October.
Let me make my point clearer.
Is it important ?

You never cared about me.
The thief dressed as a cop.
Can I show you around?
I thought we could stay here all day.

You're not 30.
Everything was perfect.
It's so much fun to listen to music.
I think Tom is right.
Life is short, even though a smile only lasts a second.
Now I know the truth.
My mother's here.
