Cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK are increasing rapidly from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of the coronavirus (COVID-19) are showing similar growth in the EU/EU economies as in the UK and at various levels, with the COVID-19 pandemic increasing at a very rapid pace in all countries, depending on the country.
According to the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the arrival of COVID-19 patients who may need health care, especially those who require intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a group of unidentified pneumonia cases were reported from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified the novel coronavirus 2 disease strain, now known as SARS-CoV-2.
The infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 was later named as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
As of now, 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have had a mild form of pneumonia, which is a respiratory tract infection.
14% of COVID-19 cases are serious illnesses requiring medical attention and the remaining 6% are severe cases requiring high-level care.
4% of patients receiving treatment for COVID-19 have a mortality rate.
In this study, we focus on comparing the total number of COVID-19 cases in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries and the United Kingdom (UK) with the total in Hubei province of China.
We compared the cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK with those in Italy from January 31-March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 is spreading in more geographic areas, and the global nature of the COVID-19 pandemic is similar to that of the country.
The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.
The Eurovigilance meeting on 5 March 2020 announced the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe using case translation by Spiteri et al, WHO.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases in people returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China were reported by France 24 in January 2020.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were reported in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom.As of 31 December 2019, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported. Of these, 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were from Italy alone.
The total number of COVID-19 cases and the total incidence
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates the global COVID-19 data of each country at 8 a.m. daily, using data from sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
The data was used to compare developments in the EU/EEA and UK with those in Italy.
We have completed a 14-day COVID-19 case reduction with a proposal for a COVID-19 case reduction in natural travel across EU/EEA and UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We have provided the country-specific figures as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to the figures for Italy from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 outbreaks in EU/EEA and UK
14 days of COVID-19 cases reported in EU/EEA countries and UK after China's Hubei region (Figure 1)
For the EU/EEA and the UK, the total number of COVID-19 cases started to increase after 21 February, followed by a sharp increase after 28 February 2020 (Help Kit).
This was mainly driven by high-profile cases from Italy, but the rest of the EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown similar increases in the overall incidence of COVID-19.
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK compared to Italy from 31 January-15 March 2020.
The highest number of cases in Italy was recorded at 8am on 15 March compared to 3 weeks earlier in 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK.
Our data show that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed COVID-19 phenomenon indicates that the pandemic is spreading at a relatively rapid rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different levels, differences in national public health, different case interpretation statements that may exist in different countries, and different protocols that may be followed in selecting eligible patients for COVID-19 testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in other affected regions of Italy were seeking intensive care, which is less than 10% of COVID-19 patients, according to media reports.
Currently, the EU/EEA level of COVID-19 admissions data is 6% in hospitals and 1% in intensive care. (data not disclosed).
They should be strategically coordinated to coordinate research on the number of cases and deaths reported.
A 2010/11 study found that there is a large disparity in the level of upper and middle income, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that the countries of the Duma may have a lower level of wealth or poverty than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
Modelling conditions related to healthcare capacity are in the sixth improvement in ECDC's COVID-19 early warning assessment, excluding the possibility of a >90% risk of COVID-19 cases in treatment and intensive care beds across EU/EEA and UK.
In some EU/EEA countries and the UK, treatment and intensive care services in certain regions that provide services to people from a limited part of the region, and for patients with I, should be at the level of the National Unit for Statistics (NUTS-2) classified as a comprehensive category.
Experience from other recent developments in Italy and other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, medical facilities and emergency departments should be prepared for the potential for a future SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the growing number of COVID-19 cases, as well as for areas with high health care needs, such as the affected areas of Italy.
A recent ECDC Strategic Risk Assessment report found that transmission of SARS-COV-2 can be reduced using a rapid, urgent and inclusive approach.Unless a process of shifting from containment to mitigation is implemented early, decision-makers and medicines cannot adequately respond to the expected rapid increase in cases.
A rapid risk assessment outlines public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have a short-term pathway to better control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
If this is not done, the number of patients requiring intensive care may increase in other EU/EEA countries within a few days or weeks.
The 2019 (COVID-19) coronavirus pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000, and is causing a devastating outbreak in other parts of the world.
Just as SARS-CoV infected thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also spread from the same locusts in a similar manner and produce similar symptoms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower transmission rate and mortality rate than SARS, and affects older men more than young men and women.
In response to the growing publicity for new diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving research project.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope this summary will help in understanding and preventing this devastating disease.
Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, is expected to be a historic day for all Chinese who have been confined to their homes for the past few weeks due to the new virus pandemic.
The virus is very similar to the SARS coronavirus that caused the 2003 pandemic, and was thus named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was named COVID-19.
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to about 50 other countries.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 40,000 patients have been discharged from treatment, and 3,000 patients have died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the public's number one enemy and is more potent than malaria.
Since the release of the viral sequence from multiple patients on January 7, 2020, more than 200 papers on COVID-19 virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment have been published in less than two months, according to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/).
This review attempts to incorporate the study's focus into a new and rapidly growing topic.
When possible, compare COVID-19 with SARS and other COVID-caused diseases, such as MERS (a 2012 pandemic).
We will also discuss the prevention and prediction of the disease, some of the changing pressing questions, and what we will be discussing from now on.
CoVs are commonly considered non-fatal for bats, causing about 15% of cases of influenza 4.
Two outbreaks of CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have been reported in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, causing severe illness and deaths, and then spreading to other countries.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third recorded CoV pandemic in human history.
As shown in Fig.1.1, pneumonia groups of unknown origin were first reported to the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
The CoV sequence was reported seven days later.
On January 15, 2020, the first death was estimated from water.
Eventually, the epidemic spreads to neighboring cities, states, and countries via the pipeline.
On January 20, health care providers were alerted to the infection, suggesting it was transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, a curfew was imposed in Wuhan, stopping public transport.
A preliminary clinical trial on January 24 found that of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 were in direct contact with the unidentified animal, which is believed to have originated from an unidentified animal.
WHO declared the pandemic a global emergency on January 30.
At the time of this writing, the epidemic has spread throughout China and to 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
The extent of the epidemic cannot be estimated as the situation is rapidly developing.
On February 11, 2020, the Multiple Care Center, which treated 4,021 patients, including 8866 confirmed COVID-19 cases, provided the following update on the best description of the pandemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects all age groups, with most cases occurring in people aged 30-65 years.
About half (47.7%) of the infected patients are over 50 years old, some are under 20 years old, and 14 patients are under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more males (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is spread in clusters within and around Hubei.
It takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of COVID-19 disease to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
From onset to death, an average of 9.5 (4.8-13) days
The baseline yield value ((R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased sharply on January 23, 2020 due to the Chinese Spring Festival travel ban.
The confirmed case mortality rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the overall mortality rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three most important risk factors for COVID-19 are sex (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of adult and envelope viruses with human RNA protein strands.
They are divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and to the dipopeptide peptide 4 (DPP4) receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, followed by membrane fusion.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; when the viral genome is replicated, the genomic RNA is fused with the plasma membrane to communicate with the virus by enveloping glycoprotein and nanocapsid protein.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was determined on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new variant of beta-CoV, with a 99.98% genetic similarity in 10 sequential samples taken from the Hunan seafood market, where the disease was first detected.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to MERS-CoV than to SaRS-CoV.
Electron microscopy of SARS-CoV-2 particles is performed in the human respiratory epithelium by ultrasonic chambers.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, compared to SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a lower affinity for human ACE2. This is due to the mild infection and infection of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may be induced by a novel protein encoded by orf3b and a protein secreted by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b plays a major role in inhibiting viral pathogenicity and IFNβ production, but orf8 has no known functional domain or pathogenicity.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., reported that full-length human ACE2 has a cryo-EM structure with amino acid transporter B0AT1 at 2.9 Å resolution.
The complex of malignant and inhibitory mechanisms was collected as a dimer and it was found that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins, providing information for the recognition and infection of the COVID.
A drug-based treatment using B0AT1 is required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The Lifter and the Mediator
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have been transmitted from mice to humans by the blood of civet and camels, respectively.
Using phylogenetics to compare SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the new virus is estimated to be 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21, from the bat, making it the first carrier of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the median vector that caused the virus to spread beyond the semen to humans is unknown, and the route of transmission is unknown.
Ji, et al., suggest that rats may be carriers of the virus from mosquitoes to humans, including the gene synthesis of the S protein homolog.
Researchers in Guangzhou, China, have identified a 99% genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-2 found in pangolin, suggesting that long-lived, cold-eating mammals such as pangolin, used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the primary carriers of SARS-CoV-2, according to a study.
However, the 1% difference in the two genomes is itself a significant difference and it is necessary to wait for the final result to conclude a definitive explanation.
The physiochemical reaction of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in a burning environment for up to 48 hours at temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius and 40%-50% humidity for approximately 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 can cause a similar infection.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be severely compromised by exposure to ultraviolet radiation and a 30-minute decrease in temperature to 56°C. 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing antimicrobials, pyractic acid, chloroform and other fatty liquids, but containing chlorhexidine, may weaken the virus.
Humans have a low immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and thus are susceptible to new viruses.
At present, no detailed analysis of the body's immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been performed.
The study also showed that the number of people infected with the coronavirus is increasing, and that the number of people infected with the coronavirus is increasing.
The virus is generally first detected by the carrier's innate immune system after attacking the carrier, including pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Using a variety of pathways, the virus helps to reduce the spread of the virus by producing inflammatory factors, dendritic cell growth, and type I interferons (IFNs), and the virus antigen is secreted by macrophages.
The SARS-CoV N protein helps the virus escape the immune system.
The immune system begins its work by interacting with others to stop the virus.
T lymphocytes such as CD4+ and CD8+ play a major role in the immune response.
CD4+T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-infected antibodies, and CD8+T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce cytokines to help the immune system.
However, CoVs can infect T-cell cells by interfering with apoptosis.
Humana immunotherapy such as C3a, C5a and antibodies are needed to block the virus.
For example, antibodies taken from surviving patients weaken MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the immune system's overwhelming response to high levels of free radicals can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in extreme cases, can result in damage to more than one organ, leading to death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely to affect elderly and pregnant people with severe health problems, when it is initiated by a group.
People who have been exposed to multiple viruses and have a weakened immune system are more likely to be infected than others.
The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is on average 1-14 days, with the initial 425 cases detected in Wuhan lasting a maximum of 3-7 months.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period is on average 3 days and can last from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study in 8,866 people found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) times longer.
Medical authorities should ensure that patients who do not show symptoms do not transmit the disease by setting the appropriate time of isolation.
Usually, people infected with the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be shortened to 24 days?
The first and most important symptom of COVID-19 is fever alone or it may be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, dizziness, blindness and vomiting.
Some patients have developed symptoms of dyspnea and/or hypoxemia within a week of contracting the disease.
In severe cases, patients develop severe respiratory problems, including septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and sudden fever should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis, even if the results of sambara radi indicate the disease.
A demographic survey conducted in late December 2019 showed that 98% of patients with fever, 76% with dry mouth, 55% with diarrhea, and 3% with cough, and 8% of the total patients require respiratory support.
Two recent studies of a family cohort and another cohort of people infected by a single asymptomatic individual have found similar results.
In contrast, a 2012 demographic survey of MERS-CoV patients found the main symptoms to be fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of cases require respiratory assistance than COVID-19. It is more dangerous and more similar to MERS than COVID-19.
Snoring (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also reported in MERS patients.
Fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), constipation (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms of SARS patients and respiratory support was found to be necessary in approximately 14%-20% of patients.
As of February 14, the total number of cases is approaching 66:576 globally, with a mortality rate of 2% for COVID-19.
In contrast, the SARS death rate in 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 deaths.
As for MERS, the death rate was 37% based on a June 2012 demographic survey with 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 R0 is between 2.9 and 4.9 with a confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23%.
Comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission rate and a lower mortality rate compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the control of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics is more difficult than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Group travel occurs in the same family or from the same gatherings or vehicles such as a transport ship.
Patients with a history of frequent travel, residents of Wuhan or other affected areas, who have been in contact with infected or non-infected individuals in the past two weeks.
However, they note that the quarantine period should be extended as patients may remain symptomless for a long time and recovering patients may contract the virus.
In the first stage, patients have a low or normal peripheral blood clot (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphotonia with a white blood cell count of 4×109/L and lymphocyte count of 1×109/L, high levels of amyotrophic lateral flow, and viruses were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Most patients reported elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation in their blood, and in some patients elevated levels of liver and kidney enzymes and myoglobin in their blood.
In patients with severe conditions, the D-dimer level, the amount of fibrin in the blood, is increased and the number of lymphocytes is significantly reduced.
Unusual symptoms on chest X-rays are seen in most COVID-19 patients, such as patchy shadows in the lungs or ground glass opacity.
The majority of patients are prone to abnormal pneumonia, sudden lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
ARDS causes uncontrolled burning, fluid retention and persistent fibrosis, which causes air pollution problems.
If type-I and type-II pneumocytes are not properly synthesized, the level of surfactants decreases, causing increased surface tension of the lung, reducing the lung's ability to expand and blocking it.
Therefore, the worst results of Samba Raj are often associated with the worst disease stage.
On February 18, 2020, the first diagnosis of COVID-19 was made, with symptoms similar to those of other viral diseases and ARDS, including respiratory tract irritation, hyaline membrane, and the formation of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of the deceased.
The reverse-transcriptase polymerase (RTPP) isolation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been used as a key method in the detection of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, the epidemic could be spread further, and diagnostics using clinical signs (not just RT-PCR) were started in China from 13 February 2020.
A similar situation has occurred with the SARS test.
Therefore, the history of the disease, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and radiology results are all important to reach an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Jang team released an application protocol for the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique for the separation of SARS-CoV-2, which allows the synthetic separation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at any size from 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) without the need for additional equipment for less than an hour.
The new technology is expected to bring about a change in the accessibility and convenience of the system in a way that is compatible.
Due to the lack of experience with new CoVs, doctors are known to only provide general care to COVID-19 patients.Alongside this, trials are being conducted using CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as treatments for other viral diseases. (Table (Table2).)
These treatments include antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from surviving patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Plasma from surviving patients has been proposed for therapeutic use.
Pharmaceutical companies are working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the lungs and to a lesser extent other ACE2-containing organs such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, respiratory problems and failure are the leading causes of death for patients with major injuries.
Therefore, respiratory aids are critical to alleviating symptoms and saving lives, including oxygen, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms are helped by extracorporeal oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique for patients with severe cardiac or respiratory problems.
In addition, electrolyte balance, prevention of secondary infection and septic shock, and organ boundary maintenance are critical for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
This cytokine storm occurs when SARS and MERS patients overreact to the immune response.
Cytokine storm is a type of systemic inflammatory response that is triggered by inflammation of various cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune cells to break down free radicals, leading to ARDS and a number of other internal organ problems.
Immunosuppression is useful for the treatment of cytokine suppression, especially in obese patients.
Tochilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, and a corticosteroid have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunological actions for cytokine storm include cell-specific immune response modulation, inhibitors of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; NJK blinatumomab; cytokine signaling S4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of infectious damage.
However, high doses of steroids are not effective in treating severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
They can also alter the course of the disease by inhibiting dangerous side effects such as avascular osteonecrosis.
However, it is recommended for use in severe COVID-19 patients with low to moderate doses of corticosteroid shortening courses.
No effective antiviral drugs are available at the time of writing.
However, a nucleotide analogue test was found to be effective in one US COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed initially by Gilead to treat Ebola and Marlburg virus disease.
Remdesivir later announced its ability to kill other white-string RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
In this context, Gilead has sent a composite to China for a series of tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the results of which are highly anticipated.
Baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin are also suggested to be effective treatments for patients with sudden respiratory distress.
The combined use of lopinavir/ritonavir may cause dizziness, blindness, vomiting, liver damage, and other risks.
The combination of these treatments with other medications should be treated with caution.
Plasma and antibody samples from surviving patients
The use of blood from recovered patients for treatment of other terminally ill patients and for prevention of infectious diseases has a long history.
In fact, people who have recovered from illness have a high level of antibodies in their blood that can fight the disease.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes, which are able to attack pathogens and other foreign objects by separating specific molecules from the host cells.
In addition, plasma blood was collected from patients recovering from COVID-19 and given to 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced infection and reduced viral loads and improved oxygen synthesis in the blood.
However, there should be a light and evidence that it can be used on a large scale before a drug is developed.
In addition to the medical effects, some plasma-related injuries should be avoided.
For example, antibodies can cause a dangerous disease called cytokine-reliever syndrome by stimulating the immune system.
The blood is very low in antibody clots. Patients with severe diseases have a high demand for plasma.
It is difficult to quickly produce specific antibodies to prevent the pandemic.
Therefore, it is important to find the genetic code that encodes the effective antibodies from the B cells of the surviving individuals or the effective antibodies that work to destroy the main virus protein.
This can be done by inducing antibody production.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various ailments.
However, the results are based on a combination of components based on a disease diagnosis and a conversion formula driven by TCM theory.
As such particles are difficult to isolate, most of the active components are not identified or clearly identified.
Currently, with no specific treatment for COVID-19 and no specific treatment, TCM remains one of the main options for treating patients with mild to moderate symptoms who are recovering from severe conditions.
Shu Feng Ji Du and Lian Hua King Wen, for example, are said to be the COVID-19 cures.
In the treatment of COVID-19 patients, many provinces, including Guangzhou (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), have reported high survival rates, but Hubei Province, where TCM treatment is used in only 30% of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest survival rate (13%).
However, this is a very inaccurate comparison because other factors, such as weight and number of patients, are not included in the estimate.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Jang and colleagues presented a study comparing Western medicine (WM) therapy alone with WM's treatment of TCM.
Compared to the WM group alone, fever patients in the WM+TCM group require a short time to return to normal, to resolve symptoms and to leave treatment.
Surprisingly, the symptom relief in the WM+ TCM group was lower (from mild to severe) than in the WM-only group (7.4% versus 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the WM+ TCM group was lower than in the WM-only group (8.8% versus 39%).
To ensure the efficacy and safety of TCM, clinically controlled trials should be conducted on a larger scale and in multiple centers.
The most sensitive to the process of determining and selecting the most effective possible TCM treatments is the practice of.
Suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients experience severe panic due to the infectious and dangerous nature of the disease.
In addition, symptoms of the infection such as fever, hypoxia, and diarrhea, and other unintended effects such as corticosteroid-induced sleep problems, insomnia, can lead to depression and cognitive instability.
In the early stages of the SARS pandemic, mental disorders such as chronic depression, anxiety, terror attacks, psychomotor excitability, psychotic symptoms, delirium and suicidal tendencies have been reported.
The mandatory quarantine and isolation of COVID-19 can make people more vulnerable and anxious.
Therefore, psychological support should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects and those in contact with them, and the general public.
The June psychosocial support includes a panel discussion of mental health professionals from multiple professions, a discussion of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and treatment plans, and a transparent and regular discussion of the improvements in the use of professional electronic devices and applications to monitor peer-to-peer interaction.
Effective vaccines are needed to prevent the spread of the transmission chain from infected animals and infected patients to people who are being cared for.
Efforts are underway to develop a long-term, high-potency, and weakening antibody based on S protein to reduce the immunity to SARS-CoV.
Vaccines for SARS made from weakened viruses have been tested in animals.
However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in adults and the efficacy of lethal test models against animal-derived viruses will be determined before clinical trials begin.
This is because no new cases have been reported since the end of SARS 17 years ago.
In contrast, irregular MERS cases and clusters have been detected in the Middle East and spread to other areas through animal carriers.
A vaccine strategy for MERS has been developed using non-stimulating viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant proteins and subunits. Some have been tested on animals.
To control this ongoing pandemic, a safe and effective vaccine is needed for people who are not immune to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the delay in developing a vaccine (average 18 months) due to the variable nature of CoVs is extremely difficult to overcome.
As COVID-19 is a new disease, the full clinical course of the disease is now being seen in thousands of patients.
In many cases, patients recover quickly without any medical treatment.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is associated with a higher incidence of psychiatric disorders and death in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary to develop a model of tuberculosis prevalence to prioritize access to health agencies, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies conducted so far, the following factors are likely to contribute to the development of COVID-19 (Box 33).
Age is important for understanding the spread of SARS and COVID-19.
A study of 8,866 cases, as described above, showed that COVID-19 occurred mainly in the 30-65 age group, of which 47.7% were over 50.
Patients waiting for intensive care services are older (average age 66 versus 51) and have long-term health problems, showing age is a strong contributor to the incidence of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As described above, SARS-CoV-2 is known to infect males from females (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000).
Additional illnesses and consequences: patients with high medical care needs with COVID-19 are more likely to experience sudden cardiac arrest and arrhythmia than others.
Heart-related deaths were also common in SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-COV-2 may cause diarrhea in patients with COVID-19 by binding to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes.
Attention should be paid to the fact that age and health conditions can be related and contradictory.
An abnormal laboratory result, the C-reactive protein (CRP) level in the blood can indicate the extent of inflammation or tissue damage and can tell us the progression of the disease, response to medication, and survival of the patient.
It has also been suggested that CRP levels may be related to COVID-19 infection.
In addition, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also affect the outcome.
These enzymes, which are released during tissue damage, are found in various organs, especially in the liver and liver
So, the doctors told us that heart failure is a disease of the liver.
Key clinical signs, chest radiography and the interim development of clinical signs and other conditions should be considered in the prediction of outcomes and implications of COVID-19.
The benefits of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as complementary therapy to reduce the severity of infectious damage in infectious diseases.
The use of high doses of corticosteroids is recommended for severe SARS patients, most of whom have survived with a condition called avascular osteonecrosis, which causes age-related disability and poor survival.
Therefore, if necessary, low-dose steroids should be used in COVID-19 patients.
Depression: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients suffer from depression, often due to isolation and seeing close relatives and patients die.
Psychological counseling and long-term support are needed to help these patients recover from their depression and return to normal life.
The June public consultations have identified different epidemiological indications of COVID-19 from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 also has a low respiratory tract infection, and other CoVs that are similar to measles show no signs of early stage mild inflammation, with infection in the upper respiratory tract.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stages of the outbreak are restricted from producing large amounts of the virus in daily circulation, which poses a significant challenge to the control of the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV is higher in patients with severe illness and much lower in patients with early-stage disease.
Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic is considered more dangerous than the SARS pandemic.
Various efforts are underway in China to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by shutting down the water and surrounding areas and quarantining the population.
While these actions are hurting the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating that the epidemic is slowing.
The pandemic is expected to end in March, with a small number of cases remaining for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al. predict that COVID-19, which is likely to be worse than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., predict that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population by developing a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic.
A Canadian team reports that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in both mid-turbine and throat-tooth faeces of patients who were discharged from hospital two weeks ago, suggesting that the newly discovered virus may be a flu-like cyclical one.
However, as new cases of Ana decline, there are promising signs in China that suggest these current strategies may be working.
Ebola was projected to cause about one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, with strict controls and a strict curfew, the disease was brought under control.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is less susceptible to infection and death and may be a co-infectious virus.
The COVID-19 pandemic is compared to SARS and MERS below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing and sneezing, and can also be transmitted by continuous coughing of infected materials.
The virus is also found in the mouth and has been shown to be capable of transmission from mouth to mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases found that 41% of cases were caused by nosocomial infections, of which 40 were health care providers, and 17 patients had other conditions.
Therefore, great care must be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and even those who have contact with the sick in non-contact situations.
To reduce the risk of infection, the first line of prevention is the introduction of face masks, surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series # 1860s), which help to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent the fluid from infected persons from moving in the air and sticking to the surface of objects and spreading to other people.
However, only N95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect against small viruses of 10 to 80 nm. Only 5% of these small viruses can enter without the mask.
As the batches are able to accommodate more than five surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks instead of surgical masks.
Health professionals should reduce transmission of the virus by wearing face masks and clean clothing, in addition to masks.
Viruses can also be transmitted through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor who was wearing an N95 mask was infected with SARS-CoV-2.The virus is thought to have been transmitted through the inflammatory eye.
Health professionals should wear a reflective face mask or sunglasses when treating patients.
People living in affected areas should wash their hands more often with soap, stay indoors and limit contact with affected people.
People should stay three feet away from the patient.
These actions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the disease.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus to humans, it was announced on 7 January 2020 that the similarity of the virus to SARS-CoV should have been a major warning to China, based on the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of Wuhan Center for Disease Control has not been able to assure citizens that the novel virus is low transmissible, has limited human-to-human transmission, and is not difficult to control.
This message has eased the public's fears, especially as the entire country prepares for the Spring Festival and misses a crucial time to control the disease if it is still on the rise.
The Chinese Agency for Disease Control says this hard lesson could lead to further important improvements.
For example, these agencies (1) should be careful about the terminology they use when making public statements, as the reasons may change citizens' attitudes and decisions; (2) avoid waiting for regular statements from doctors or public authorities, avoid reluctance to integrate unusual clinical information; (3) avoid working with the public to ensure that the epidemic is contained in the early stages of prevention; (4) improve the community response and outreach system in a systematic manner, by promoting public awareness and understanding of the pandemic, and by adhering to clear and consistent practices.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in December 2019.
In less than two months as of this writing, it has spread across China and to more than 50 countries.
The virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, creating a similar feeling to the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS are seen in the control of the disease and the epidemic.
COVID-19 affects older men more than young men and men more than women.The risk and mortality rates of the disease are higher in older men than in young men.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher (10.91% versus 1.44%) compared to COVID-19.
Patients with COVID-19 may not show symptoms and may transmit the virus, but SARS cases are more likely to occur when they are more common, making COVID-19 control more difficult than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is more widely transmitted than SARS-CoV.
The normal SARS-CoV-2 detection RNA may be inherited in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovering patients may have a second infection.
These contacts will immediately slow the spread of the virus.
There are several critical challenges in rapid COVID-19 testing that are awaiting resolution.
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genetic homologue between two SARS-CoV-2 strains of mosquito-like CoVs has been identified, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from mosquitoes.
What is the primary carrier of the virus, i.e. the animal that is the intermediate carrier from the mosquito to humans?
Without knowing answers #1 and 2, we cannot completely stop the disease, and therefore the pandemic may return at another time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical assay reveal that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how does the virus enter respiratory cells and cause pathological infections?
Does the virus contain ACE2-EXPRESSING inhibitors?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot provide rapid diagnosis, diagnosis, and treatment.
How long can the pandemic last?
How does the virus evolve when it is transmitted from person to person?
Will the pandemic disappear like SARS or will it recur like the flu?
While important, time will be needed to conduct the necessary research to answer the above and other questions.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to end the pandemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
The zoonotic origin of the human coronavirus
Coronavirus and their host, including humans, have evolved over thousands of years through mutation and adaptation.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause a pandemic.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) pandemic have shown that HCoV infection is potentially life threatening.
SARS-CoV-2 was detected in central China in 2019 as a European controlled by CoVs.CoVs have a high transmission rate but show a lower pathogenicity than SARS-CoV.
HCoVs are a zoonosis and it is useful to understand the zoonotic origin of HCoVs.
Most HCoVs are derived from disease-resistant bacteria.
The median habitat of HCoVs is also known.
Animal tissue recognition plays a major role in finding immunity.
Studying and testing animal contact with CoV virus infected individuals can provide better information to help diagnose the disease.
This research includes our knowledge of the seven HCoVs based on the transmission history and transmission from animals to humans.
The main focus is on the similarity and differentiation of different types of HCoVs in terms of mutation of the virus and genome composition.
The timing of the COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this article.
In addition, we discussed the success of the transition from residential to residential and the impact of the spread of the virus on the severity of the disease.
Coronavirus (CoVs) belong to the family of viruses known as Coronaviridae. Coronaviridae include enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded groups of RNA viruses.
These viruses are large genomes of 26 to 32 kg and are invisible to the naked eye, so they are called CoVs because of their unique genetic makeup.
Non-segmented CoVs have a similar structure in their genes.
Approximately two-thirds of this genome has two large open reading frames (ORF1a for ORF1b), which translate to pp1a for pp1ab for replicate polyproteins.
These polyproteins are called nsp1~16 and are used to produce the non-structured protein nsp16.
The remainder of the genome includes the amorphous ORF protein, which contains the spike (S), the membrane (E), the membrane (M), and the nucleoprotein (N).
Lineage-specific helper proteins are covered by different lineages of CoVs.
CoVs are divided into four classes based on protein structure differentiation (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). Of these, beta-CoVs contain the majority of HCoVs and have forty classes (A, B, C and D).
The paleogenic explanation is that bats and mice are the gene sources for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the primary host for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have crossed ethnic boundaries and some have become serious human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
There is a significant difference between HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 and alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs included HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 show symptoms such as fever and cough.
Compared to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2, it has a higher infection rate, and most people are more likely to develop severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and non-pulmonary symptoms following severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was identified in 1960 as a strain of malaria.
Subsequent studies of the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses have provided a wealth of information.
Before the SARS pandemic, HCoVs were thought to be harmless.
The worst SARS outbreak in history was reported in 2003, affecting more than 8,000 people, and killing 10 percent of them.
After a decade, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) continues to spread to the rest of the world as an epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula.
The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was identified in 2019 as HCoV (2019-nCoV), SARS-CoV-2, is a contagious disease that has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been sounded and the world must prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs originated from bats, wasps and other domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence point to the origin of all HCoVs from mosquitoes, although the viruses are not pathogenic and adapted well, but show extensive genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about major medical, scientific, social and moral reforms in China and the world.
Understanding the natural history, driving force and causes of strain limitations are needed to trace the zoonotic origins of HCoVs.
This may lead to habitat degradation, interbreeding and reproduction of animal host cells for SARS-CoV-2, and effective measures to prevent further spread.
This review includes the HCoVs' animal feces, animal-to-animal transmission capacity and disease-causing capacity.
In particular, we discussed the similarities between HCoVs' viruses being disease-free in their habitat but starting to mutate after being transferred to another species.
The transmission of HCoVs is evaluated by reducing the transmission capacity for most of the pathogenicity period.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was also discussed in this proposal.
Animal CoVs have been known since the 1930s.
Before the first detection of HCoV-229E strain B814 from a human infected with chickenpox, several viruses were found in a number of animals including camels, mice, rats, rats and rats.
In the last decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the HCoV transmission history will be provided in the following order (Table 1) as a guide and a table.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated in 1966 from people with upper respiratory tract infections, but it later became infected and spread in the WI-38 pulmonary tract.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have experienced common symptoms of cough, such as headache, wheezing, nausea, and sore throat, along with fever and tuberculosis in 10 to 20 percent of cases.
In 1967, HCoV-OC43 was discovered in an organ culture and later in a mosquito's cortex.
Clinically apparent infection of HCoV-OC43 is characterized by similar symptoms to HCoV-229E, which are not distinguished from other respiratory infections caused by viruses such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E is globally distributed to HCoV-OC43, which is expected to spread more widely in the winter season in the Arctic.
Overall, the incubation period of the two viruses is less than a week, followed by a nearly 2-week illness.
Research on volunteer individuals suggests that people infected with HCoV-229E have had some symptoms of influenza.
Only a few of the patients with low immune system developed severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as uncommon pneumonia, is the first human-induced HCoV-associated global pandemic in human history to be properly documented, and the third HCoV to be identified.
The first case of SARS was reported in 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
In many countries and regions, 8,096 people have been infected with SARS, and 774 have died as a result.
The high-transmittance cases can spread to about two new cases, which require an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, with the highest viral load occurring on day 10.
People infected with SARS-CoV show symptoms of sore throat, headache, fever, fatigue and diarrhea, shortness of breath, diarrhea and respiratory illness.
lymphonia, impaired liver function tests, high creatinine kinase, common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Diffuse aliviolare damage, epithelial cell rupture and macrophage overload have been observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require high-level care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, organs such as the lungs, liver, and kidneys may also be affected in case of severe disease.
The virus was first detected in a patient who had undergone an open lung biopsy from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, several efforts have been made to investigate HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in 2004 from a 7-month-old infant in the Netherlands.
It was first prevalent in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised people with respiratory infections.
Symptoms of cholera, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in HCoV-NL63-transmitted diseases.
Other successful studies have found that an 8-month-old baby with pneumonia in the Netherlands could have the same virus from an anchovy swab sample.
Although it is known in the Netherlands, it has spread internationally.
HCoV-NL63 caused up to 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses, with the most frequent occurrences occurring in early winter, spring and summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with the incubation of the Langka.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was detected in Hong Kong in a 71-year-old man who had been receiving treatment for pneumonia and bronchitis.
HCoV-HKU1 is associated with acute infections in addition to community pneumonia and bronchitis.
Along with HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has also been identified globally, resulting in mild respiratory illness.
These four environmentally transmitted HCoVs are well adapted to humans and have a low ability to mitigate severe disease, although there have been unknown cases of infection with multiple variants of HCoV-NL63, which recently caused severe lower respiratory illness in China.
Overall, the ability of HCoVs to transmit and survive in the body reduces their ability to repair damage.
MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia in a 60-year-old patient with severe renal disease.
Most of the laboratory confirmed cases are from the Middle East, with recent secondary transmission of the new cases reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
In 2015, South Korea recorded 186 confirmed cases of the second wave of the pandemic.
The clinical symptoms of MERS are SARS, which causes a progressive severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, MERS patients are more likely to develop sudden kidney disease, which makes the infection unique from other HCoV-derived diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as constipation and nausea.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have seen a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most virulent viruses known to humans.
In December 2019, cases of SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has named the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection, which is a global public health threat, COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 cases and 3.4% deaths worldwide.
The death rate is 4.2% in Hebei, and 1.2% in other parts of China.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with symptoms including fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients have experienced seizures.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly progress to severe respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV is 82% identical to SARS-CoV-2 in high nucleotide sequence homology, it is derived from different paleogeneic branches.
SARS-CoV-2 has a lower incidence and higher transmission rate compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and are contributing to the rapid spread worldwide.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals significant similarities and differences.
First, the pathogenicity of HCoVs is very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 is the pathway to death of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is based on the relationship between SARS-CoV and the four environmentally transmitted HCoVs (e.g., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections often exhibit characteristics similar to those of environmentally transmitted HCoVs, including opacity, mild symptoms or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small number of severe COVID-19 cases may be considered SARS-CoV infection cases, although the ratio is low.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is surprisingly similar to the transmission of SARS-CoVs by environmentally transmitted HCoVs.
On the other hand, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than that of HCoVs transmitted from the environment.
On the other hand, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it is not yet known whether SARS-CoV-2 reduces the potential for human-to-human transmission.
Finally, like other HIV viruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
The role of oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in some cases, like SARS-CoV, is expected to be identified in further research.
Changes in SARS-CoV-2 during different seasons of the year are expected to occur in HCoVs-infected populations.
The nature of transmission and severity of SARS-CoV-2 is determined by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The four HCoVs detected in the community show mild symptoms.
On the other hand, humans may be infected with these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of the original HCoV pandemic.
No HCoVs that cause serious disease in humans and no humans present with symptoms of HCoVs are currently known.
For this, HCoVs must be detected in a wide range of low-level mutations.
Therefore, as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to spread, and as more people die, the likelihood of transmission to humans increases.
If properly managed, pandemics can be difficult to contain through lockdowns or other governments.
For years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been infecting people with measles.
These viruses have become a staple of animal life.
In general, SARS-CoVs with high disease tracking capacity have not adapted well to MERS-CoVs in humans and inter-human transmission cannot be treated.
They must remain and multiply in their zoonotic habitats and seek the opportunity to penetrate human targets, using one or more intermediate and multiplication habitats.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, the four environmentally transmitted HCoVs.
This is similar to the spread of environmentally-acquired HCoVs, at least for now.
However, it is less common than community-acquired HCoVs and is less aggressive than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is not yet known whether it will fully adapt to humans or whether it will be able to move around inside humans without any barriers or intermediate animal habitat.
It is useful to evaluate the evolution, natural adaptation, medium-range and breeding of HCoVs in animals before using HCoVs in the test.
Homology of the host in the nucleotide sequence level suggests that animals are the host of HCoVs.
This virus is transmitted from seed to the host and does not cause disease.
Thus, the human body can remain a long-term host for HCoV.
In both cases, these habitats are naturally transmitted HCoVs or their offspring's natural habitat.
Conversely, if an HCoV-infected animal is transmitted to humans in a short time, the virus may cause serious illness because it does not adapt to the new carrier.
The animal medium carrier serves as a human infection outlet and also plays a key role in promoting the virus' ability to infect by spreading for a short time inside the animal.
HCoV death may eventually cause transmission if it cannot continue to be transmitted within the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoVs can adapt to a host environment and may become a long-term host.
The mandible becomes a natural resting place at this time.
Epidemiological data for the SARS index case have a history of interaction with game animals.
Sequential seroprevalence testing shows that animal traders are higher carriers of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Covered mosquitoes (Paguma larva) and raccoons are available in the animal market and are the first to be identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses.
This was helped by the subsequent failure to report SARS cases, which indirectly killed all the infected in the market.
However, covered desert or agricultural mammals without live stock market exposure were widely negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that covered mammals were intermediate host hosts, not intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV.
Obviously, more than 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have antibodies to SARS-CoV, not to mention the fact that the small populations of various species are intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be dead ends of the SARS-CoV habitat.
Ongoing animal studies have shown natural SARS-CoV habitats associated with the bat CoV, SARS-related rhinolous bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These mice are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and genome sequences of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other mosquito CoVs and SARS-CoVs have 88-92% similarity in niclotide.
These studies have revealed a new idea that bedbugs can produce human pathogens.
Many SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) are derived from mosquitoes, but other than WIV1 are not life-form viruses.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor for SARS-CoV.
A strain sample of mice from WIV1 was found to be ACE2 receptor-injecting mice, mice and humans.
Surprisingly, SARS patients were able to eliminate the seronovelcent WIV1.
WIV1 is currently 95% nucleotide-similar to the SARS-CoV in Loqueto.
Although there is high homology between the two viruses, WIV1 is not believed to be a virus-mediated strain of SARS-CoV and the bacteria are not mediated hosts of SARS-CoV.
Palogenetic analysis of MERS-CoV has identified the pathogenic CoV-HKU4 as a pathogenic CoV-HKU5 group.
The same type of virus, known as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), is used as an introduction to the influenza CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoVs is structurally similar to beta-CoVs in Africa and Europe.
So far, no MERS-CoV has been found alive in desert bats.
MERS-CoV is 87% homologous in the nucleotide sequence to its closest relative, the virus CoV-HKU25.
Therefore, mosquitoes may not be direct hosts of MERS-CoV.
In other words, studies in the Middle East have confirmed that dromedary camels are seropositive mediators of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies, similar to Middle Eastern camels originating from African countries.
The live MERS-CoV is identical to the human virus from the deromoderous camel's squirrel nose, meaning camels serve as a feeding ground for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that mild symptoms have been observed in camels tested for MERS-CoV along with high viral transmission.
Obviously, infected camels transmit the virus not only by breathing but also by passing it through the mouth, which is the main route for bats to spread the virus.
However, as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels, further questions remain, and there may be unknown transmission potential for human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV to unidentified animal species.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% nucleotide homology with the bacterial CoV RaTG13, which is derived from Rhinophilus affinus bacteria.
In cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it is very difficult to distinguish the relationship between the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 sequence changes.
This means that viruses may not be intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless approximately equivalent viruses of CoVs are detected in the future.
A wholesale animal slaughter market in Hunan reports the first cases of COVID-19.
Several recent studies show that several endangered microorganisms such as pangolin (Manis Javinca) of the genus Beta-CoVs may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 based on metagenomic sequencing.
These new pangolin CoV genomes have 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are 90 percent similar to RaTG13 in terms of nucleotide structure.
It is classified into two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2 as viruses in the paleogenetic branch, one with SARS-CoV-2, 97.4% amino acid sequence identification and a highly similar receptor (RBD).
In the Stark comparison, SARS-CoV-2 is divergent from RaTG13 to RBDs, with a high degree of homology genome sequence.
A study of infected pangolins reported viral contamination from sambal samples, and was similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used a variety of synthesis methods and management techniques to sequence a portion of the genome, which makes up 86.3% of the total virus genome.
Pangolin is a potential animal host for SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 originated directly from pangolin, which is produced by the switching of scans between SARS-CoV-2 pangolin and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs.
Furthermore, the distance between the SARS-CoV-2 monkey and RaTG13 is shorter than between the SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in pangolins and other mosquitoes is not yet known.
The highest sequence homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the panglion, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, and SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 with high genome-wide sequence homology.
The high similarity of the pangolin RBD to SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs to SARS-CoV-2 was determined by selectivity as an evolutionary convergent.
Further proposals are needed for recombination between the panglionSARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal strain.
As a driving force of evolution, recombination of beta-CoVs has spread.
The jury is working to determine the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have been studied.
Paleogenic evidence for HCoV-NL63 suggests that HCoV-229E originated from mosquito CoVs, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 originated from mice.
A CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) similar to HCoV-NL63 has been reported in North America.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is generally associated with another strain of CoV, known as Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and is suspected to be an intermediate host.
The current knowledge of animal HCoVs is presented in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Paleogenetic analysis suggests that there is historical evidence for transmission of HCoVs between species.
A respiratory infection epidemic was reported in 1890 when HCoV-OC43 began to spread from domestic animals to humans.
The history of transmission of HCoV-229E between different animal species is unclear.
The mosquito alpha-CoVs have been found to be highly similar to HCoV-229E.
Among them is Alpeca alpha-CoV.
Evidence suggests that the virus is transmitted directly from bats to humans.
Before alpacas, humans lived in the same ecological nest as the locusts.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with alpecas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related influenza alpha-CoVs are specific and non-pathogenic in mosquitoes, and alpeca alfa-CoV has caused respiratory infections in infected animals.
Finally, alpeca alfa-CoV has not been detected in wild animals.
Therefore, it is not possible to rule out the possibility that alpacas may have also transmitted this HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
In fact, mosquitoes are the direct source of human disease viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nifa virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that HCoV-229E viruses can be directly transmitted to humans.
Although mosquito alpha-CoVs are variants of HCoV-229E, animals such as alpacas and Arabian camels have been able to transmit MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of the transmission of the virus from species to species, from bats to dromedary camels to dromedary camels to humans.
The origin of the MERS-CoV from the mosquito was identified in its initial identification and confirmed by follow-up contacts.
It is clear that bats carry multiple strains of viruses, which can lead to cross-species transmission.
The mosquito is the main transmitter of the virus because of its longevity, robust habitat, close function and ability to transmit.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in camel dromedaries for decades.
They have successfully adapted to these camels and are now a permanent fixture.
MERS-CoV is mildly pathogenic and has low mutation potential in these animals.
As an accidental human-to-human transmission, humans are the ultimate carriers of MERS-CoV and the pandemic is unlikely to be permanent.
Compared to the role of camels in MERS-CoV selection, transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, is unique.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic to pangolins.
The final host of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, which may be transmitted with SARS-CoV strains.
The role of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from different animals is expected to be clarified in further research.
First, the SARS-CoV-2-related virus may serve as a host for the SARS-CoV-2 strain.
People can share an ecological niche with the bats by pollinating or pollinating.
In addition, pangolin cattle have been identified as a vector for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has been shown to be a potential vector for the virus.
people are infected by biting and eating meat.
Many species of domestic animals, including domestic animals, may be resistant to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody studies in wildlife and domestic animals are approved.
Third, it has been suggested that recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species if they were in contact with both the larvae and pangolins.
The animal-origin search for SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
There are three main methods to prevent the spread of CoVs from different animal host species to other host species.
First, their high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
The average rate of replication is ~10-4 replication rates per year by site 2, which is determined by the adaptation of the new carrier to the CoV.
CoVs are proof-reading exoribonucleases.
The niclotide analogue exoribonuclease, called Remdesivir, blocks the spread of CoVs by blocking RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is the most promising of the SARS-CoV-2 drugs in clinical trials.
However, the number of CoVs in the mix is more than their host by millions.
CoVs also mutate and adapt more quickly when there is a lack of adaptation to infection.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high rate of mutation, SARS-CoV-2 has a low rate of mutation, indicating a high potential for adaptation to humans.
perhaps it was first transmitted to animals similar to humans.
In addition, SARS-CoV-2, which is also related to MERS-CoV, is well adapted to the camel dromedary.
Theoretically, genetic variation does not make a vaccine or antiviral for SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome of CoVs also showed adaptive genome modification and recombination, thus increasing the chance of co-evolution from species to species, and facilitating the release of these new CoVs when conditions are favorable.
These are determined by the pre-reading box and protein functions up to the last 3 genomes.
Third, during overexploitation, RNA CoVs change their structure and botany abruptly and repeatedly.
A host cell, the strand mutation occurs frequently in CoV RNA transcription.
RNAs of very similar full size and subgenome mutate to create new CoVs.
Evidence of natural recombination phylogenetics has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animal-infecting CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
The virus is transmitting and spreading.
In addition to the three viruses mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with its host host is a key factor in its ability to transmit from generation to generation.
The combination of SARS-CoV can be taken as an example, which is evidence of positive selectivity between different animal species during disease transmission.
Comparisons between human and viral SARS-CoVs have shown that SARS-CoV can adapt to different habitats more easily, particularly through RBD of S protein mixtures.
In general, the RBD of the S protein of CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is determined by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is a 318 to 510 amino acid in S1 fragment, which binds to the human ACE2 receptor and viral entry.
RBD can detect the ACE2 receptors of SARS-CoV in a variety of animals, including bats, mice, rats, and dogs, allowing cross-species transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found to be distinct from human and RBD-derived viruses, and 4 were found in the receptor-binding motif to bind to the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV K479N virus has a mutation of S487T in RBD, which increases the interaction of these spike proteins with human ACE2 receptors.
Alternatively, these two amino acid substitutes may be the limiting factor for the virus' adaptation to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV indicates the ability of the S protein to bind to human ACE2 in the S1 unit of the S protein.
Studies in cryo-EM have shown that the ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein concentrations in humans are 10 to 20 times higher.
It should also be confirmed that additional receptors are needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
However, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2, but is a separate S subtype.
There are several HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase A for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
CoVs from different animals to humans may have a fluid habit.
In addition to this host, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also limited by other cell habitat and limitation factors.
The separation of these host proteins between human and natural host HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and bats may impose a limit on species-to-species transmission.
HCoVs are vulnerable to host cell pathogens by attacking host cell barriers and reducing the risk of effective interspecies transmission.
Therefore, the molecular critical point in the relationship between the virus and the carrier virus is still unknown.
The uncoordinated genome-complete analysis of the habitat and the causes of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak using the CRISPR art technology methodology may be fruitful.
Emergency of these new HCoVs to return to zero
Variants of fluid CoVs provide a high potential for emergence of new HCoVs.
This means that the virulent CoVs serve as the gene vector for HCoVs.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are two steps that allow HCoVs to multiply and serve as a beneficiary of this process.
For example, the acquisition or destruction of new protein-coding genes has the potential to significantly improve viral phonotypes.
The SARS-CoV virus was not detected in mouse SARS-CoV, but was detected in the SARS-CoV virus receptor protein ORF8, which is believed to have been transmitted to humans by ORF8.
29-Niclotide classification of SARS-CoVs characteristics has been identified in early human pandemic strains.
This classification of ORF8 suggests ORF8a and ORF8b, which are a genetic mutation that helps the virus to spread from one carrier to another.
SARS-CoV has a history of association with alpha- and gamma-line RNAs, and a large number of small recombinant regions have been identified in RNA polymerases.
In nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14 are isolated within the re-infection areas.
Meanwhile, MERS-CoV infection was found to be transmitted in several lineages, most notably in Saudi Arabian dromedary camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the co-infection process is also seen in HCoVs.HCoVs combine with animal-derived CoVs through unmodified genes.
Artificial selection can also cause undesirable mutations in the virus' genome. This can be achieved through the efforts of the immune system.
An example of these effects is the complete ORF4 structure of the HCoV-229E proteasome, which is affected by the two-nucleotide cancellation.
Uninfected ORF4 may be present in HCoV-229E-like viruses found in mice and camels.Alpaca alpha-CoVs show nucleotide insertion and form a frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is determined by the selection of their habitat pressures.
CoVs have been reported to infect bats with no or only mild symptoms, indicating a bilateral transmission of CoVs to bats.
It shows that the bacteria are widely adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, the pre-quantitative response stimulation of ticks effectively reduces the pathology caused by CoVs.
In addition, their killing activity in the larynx is inhibited due to NKG2/CD94 receptors and low histocombinability.
Moreover, high levels of oxygen species reactivity (ROS) can be influenced by the increased or decreased metabolic activity of the larvae and the exoribonucleus, so the formation of viral strains can be highly pathogenic when introduced into a new habitat.
Additional pathogenic CoVs can infect cells by altering their protein or protein structure.
It is therefore not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or mildly symptomatic parasites that are common in bats and camels.
They reproduce rapidly in areas without strong immune systems.
The mystery of why people are asymptomatic and why this infection causes serious illness in humans can be solved.
These severe symptoms are often triggered by a severe immune system overload, and cytokine storms can cause severe lung damage in those with strong immune systems.
In contrast, asymptomatic carriers of the virus
Similarly, linking to the immune system may have beneficial effects on the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
This reaction is particularly strong in the larvae.
Therefore, it is useful to administer interferon to type-1 SARS-CoV-2 infections in the early stages of human infection.
Furthermore, NLRP3 does not activate the inflammatory response in the glands.
Therefore, MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19 by blocking the continuation of NLRP3.
The SARS-CoV-2 emergency follows the general pattern of MERS-CoV detection.
The beta-CoV of the mosquito also has 95% similarity to the nucleotide of SARS-CoV and 96% similarity to SARS-CoV-2.
Although animals in the lab were found to be infected with the same virus as SARS-CoV, no mediated direct transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs are surprisingly homogeneous to SARS-CoV-2, which means that pangolins may serve as intermediate hosts or pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to the final segment of the gene fragments of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was accidentally or intentionally made by humans.
CoVs have been re-identified during the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The integrity of bats and other animal CoVs has led to a better understanding of the zoonotic origins and the importance of animal shelter in human transmission of HCoVs.
There is evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via other intermediate hosts.
The SARS-CoV infection can be effectively stopped by preventing it from spreading between humans and infected people in the marketplace, closing down cheap markets and killing the infected.
For the same reason, pangolins should be withdrawn from the market to prevent zoonotic transmission, in response to the discovery of several lineages of pangolin beta-CoVs that are associated with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they will be challenged in future studies on how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans from pangolins and other rodents.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in the dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels serve as useful transportation and are the main source of meat, grain, leather and leather products for humans.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is possible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as in the wildlife market in China to stop the spread of SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2.
A holistic approach to developing effective vaccines against camel MERS-CoV is needed to stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, in conjunction with other infection control measures.
As we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge to cause pandemics.
Many human-to-animal CoVs are transmitted between animals.
There are many influenza CoVs that can be transmitted to humans.
These animal CoVs can produce highly transmissible and potentially dangerous CoVs to humans in their continuous distribution and spread.
In order to reduce the gap between humans and animals, the eating of wild animals in some parts of China should be banned.
Better preparation and response to the crisis of SARS, MERS and COVID-19 is needed.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a very long time.
They are said to remain in their natural habitat until the chance of extinction is reached.
Although mosquitoes have many features that can spread the virus, this spread can be reduced by reducing human contact with mosquitoes and other wildlife.
To reduce further animal-to-human transmission, strict controls should be carried out on mammals.
The most effective way to prevent animal-to-human transmission is to avoid the environment where dangerous virus-carrying animals live.
There are also unknown factors in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
First, it is important to understand how bats and pangolins have similar ecological niches if they transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus from their genus via pangolin.
The human-animal interaction should be determined by the role of the mouse in the transmission of the disease to humans.
Third, a third species, if it is to be considered as a valid intermediate habitat, must be compared to the way it is interbred with various species of humans, including bats and pangolins.
Finally, many species, including domestic animals, may be resistant to SARS-CoV-2, and surveillance and testing of infections should be undertaken.
SARS-CoV-2 or the parent virus is believed to be found in the natural habitat of bats, pangolins, and other mammals in the future.
Local tests have linked human immunity to COVID-19 mutations in animal SARS-CoV-2.
Testing criteria for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 should be updated periodically.
The paper published by our team on February 6, 2020 provides a strong evidence-based approach to combating the pandemic worldwide by providing rapid guidance and practices for diagnosing and recommending the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection.
However, the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new disease. Studies and clinical experiences in the Senate are gradually expanding our knowledge. Therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies will continue to improve.
In response to a comment in our guidance, we have issued new guidelines for testing of suspected and confirmed patients, as revised by the new Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) of the Chinese National Health Committee.
The new coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in December 2019.
On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic.
We have prepared a rapidly available advisory guide to defeat SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was published online on February 06, 2020 in Military Medical Research.
much attention has been focused on the printed page.
However, given that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience, so the diagnosis and treatment strategy is constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Commission of China has published seven editions of its updated guidelines for COVID-19 testing and treatment from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020.
We have received a simple benchmark from Zhou et al., based on clinical experience.
Their work is also useful for the pandemic worldwide, providing new information for our guidance.
we express our gratitude and support their important work.
However, their functioning needs to be improved based on the new COVID-19 (Trial seventh version) Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines and new findings.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), one set of epidemiological data is needed to confirm the needs of suspected cases and two sets of clinical evidence to make a definitive study, or three sets of clinical evidence without a clear epidemiological history.
Epidemiological history: (1) travel history, Wuhan and its environs where COVID-19 infection was reported in the last 14 days before symptoms appeared, (2) contact history with people with SARS-CoV-2 infection (confirmed by nucleic acid testing), (3) contact history with fever or other respiratory symptoms in Wuhan and its environs where COVID-19 infection was reported in the last 14 days before symptoms appeared, (4) group contact history with patients with confirmed fever and/or other respiratory symptoms in less than 2 weeks, particularly in confined spaces such as homes, offices or schools, etc.
Clinical description: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) with a characteristic image of COVID-19 infection; (3) normal, damaged, or missing lymphocyte count in the early stage of infection.
Positive detection of suspected pathogenic or serological tests by testing: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing showing high homogeneity with known coronaviruses; (3) positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody; or SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody change from negative to positive, or ≥4 times in the recovery phase than acute phase titer.
Real-time PCR for nucleic acid samples of respiratory and blood systems were released in the second and third editions (18 January 2020) and (22 January 2020).
Diagnosis of blood tests was included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions, after which the serological theme was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the efforts of researchers to develop a more efficient nucleic acid detection kit.They also depend on obtaining better blood and respiratory system samples and supporting positive antibody results to be included in validated assays.
Evidence suggests that attention should be given to people who have unusual symptoms and those who do not show any symptoms.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. flow chart should be improved to indicate that people without symptoms are at low risk.
This methodology needs further practical and research validation.
We hope to get a clear enough explanation to cover and our readers will call and give their opinion.
Local guidelines are needed to distinguish between suspected and confirmed cases.
Our team helps by providing timely guidance.
Bangladesh reports five deaths from COVID-19, on the day of the highest
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five deaths from COVID-19 in the same month.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news release, IEDCR Director, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the death toll included four males and a female.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two of the cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60, and one was 41-50 years old.
Both victims are from poor backgrounds.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11.
Hospital officials told local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, after he was investigated by Kuwait's Maitre Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bento, Obaidul Quader, said public transport would be closed for longer than originally planned, until next Sunday.
The public transit closure began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on April 4.
Transportation of basic goods - medicine, fuel and food - is still allowed.
The first recorded case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was on March 8, when two people returned from Italy, one of whom was a housewife.
As of March 19, all three men have recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 global cases have exceeded one million
On Thursday, the total number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million, according to Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths are related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This milestone comes on the day that Malawi has recorded its first confirmed coronavirus infection and Zambia has recorded its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea has declared itself one of the few countries free of coronavirus as of Thursday.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, with 79,332 cases reported in the 24 hours after 10 a.m. central European time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reports that more than 1,000 US coronavirus deaths were recorded on Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Worldwide, countries have declared strict restrictions on the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin said Russians will continue to receive their classes without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament has decided to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days with 215 votes in favour, 10 against and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia has moved its holy sites of Mecca and Medina to a full day of "come home" hours; previously, this was "come home" hours from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand has introduced a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine says the state will extend the curfew until May 1.
In Australia, stores have reduced the number of soft drinks they can buy at a time.
On Saturday and Saturday nights, the Australian department store chain Walworth's eased restrictions on the sale of single-use packages of paper towels and coals.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a one-bakko ban.
These limits were used in posts and messages on Facebook.
The overcrowding is reported to be due to the threat of self-quarantine due to COVID-19.
On Thursday, Walworth decided to sell one pack of toilet paper per order for home delivery.
The changes come after Wal-Walls and Coles announced a ban on buying more than 400 baccos at a time on March 4 and 5.
In a statement on March 8, Coles said that while the ban on the sale of more than 40 bacoo stores is in place, "many stores are selling out within an hour".
A Woolworths representative said markets showed strong gains in the past week.
Costco's Canberra store has doubled the allowable amount since last week.
To better address the shortage, Coles ordered a larger package of supplies and re-visits, Woolworth ordered additional deliveries, and ALDI announced the launch of the Wednesday Special Delivery.
Russell Zimmerman, secretary general of the Australian Merchants Association, tries to push prices up, but is hampered by temporary travel restrictions imposed by the local council.
Stores expect to see a rise in prices as demand matures.
ALDI said on Tuesday that some stores were unable to meet their Wednesday special due to the rush of the auction.
According to a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist at Queensland University of Technology, notes that the drugs are being filled every night.
The soap is a huge commodity, with very low quantities on sale, and, once all is sold, it leaves too many empty stalls, which creates a feeling of scarcity.
"If the same observation as Coles and Walworth, with more coal on the shelf, and more toilet paper and products like sanitizers are bought and made available in large quantities, then perhaps the toll could be reduced", Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturers said they could end production on Thursday.
Kimberly-Clark and Sorbent, who make the paper Clinics, and Solaris Paper, who make the paper, are working 24/7 to keep the paper affordable, News.com.au reports.
Domain.com, a real estate website, writes that some sellers have given free shanty cards to early bidders at a Melbourne auction, with a few auctions taking place over the weekend.
The news NT, a daily newspaper published in Darwin, published a eight-page segment in its Thursday edition that could be cut and used as a scrapbook.
According to a March 3 ABC Australia report, the start-up stores were lagging behind in implementing the ban, saying they had no provisions to limit the size of the products in the store.
Russell Zimmerman said other products are also in high demand, including masks, hygiene fluids, cleaning products, bathroom fixtures and refrigerators.
Similarly, outside of Australia, the British online supermarket Okado was seen limiting the sale of 12 roll packs to the Andrei's laundry room on Sunday evening.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 coronavirus, caused by SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic on Wednesday.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that governments should act if the term 'pandemic' does not indicate where the disease is spreading and where it is dangerous".
All countries can change the course of the pandemic even now.
Countries must respond to people in the areas of surveillance, testing, tracking, monitoring and travel, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO.
"We are deeply concerned about the alarming scale and consistency of this and the disturbing level of neglect".
"According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was "unplanned".
"According to the February issue of CNN, 'except for influenza, no respiratory virus has survived since its global spread.'"
Geber Jesus made a similar comment: "There has never been a coronavirus pandemic like this".
'We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time,' he added.
The new constitution follows the January WHO resolution, which declared a public health emergency requiring global attention.
"The end-line, it will become more and more compelling", said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
The Associated Press reported at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases and 4,600 deaths worldwide on Thursday.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a continuation of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which is caused by a virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The pandemic was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a global emergency on February 30, 2020, and the pandemic was recognized on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, with 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been cured.
The mortality rate in the country is estimated at 4%, and globally, from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Symptoms may include conditions such as pneumonia and severe respiratory distress.
The incubation period for symptoms is five days, but it is recommended to extend to 14 days after diagnosis.
To date, no known vaccine or specific antiviral drug has been developed.
First is symptomatic and supportive treatment. Washing hands, covering your mouth, social distancing, and isolating suspected patients are some examples of precautions that can be taken.
Authorities around the world responded with the following travel restrictions, lockdowns, entry times, workplace injury prevention, and closures.
The pandemic has led to numerous global social and economic disruptions, including sports events, religious events, political and cultural events, cancellations of timings and shortages of donations related to humanitarian development products.
Schools and higher education institutions are closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's students.
Misinformation about the virus has been spread through the Internet, and there have been cases of xenophobia and xenophobia among Chinese populations, other East and Southeast Asian populations, and people from affected areas.
By reducing travel and closing heavy industries, it has reduced carbon emissions and air pollution.
Health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China, began investigating early January 2020 after reporting an unknown group of pneumonia cases on December 31, 2019.
Most cases were linked to the Wuhan seafood wholesale market and it is believed that the virus was transmitted from animals.
The virus causing the pandemic is a new virus called SARS-CoV-2, which is similar to the mosquito-borne coronaviruses pangolin, coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.The first case of the virus was reported on December 1, 2019.The person was not known to have any direct contact with the fish market and other groups later identified.
Two-thirds of the first group of cases in December 2019 had contact with the marketplace.
On March 13, 2020, an unidentified source reported that, going back to November 17, 2019, a case of a 55-year-old resident of Hubei Province was the first to be reported.A WHO report on February 26, 2020, noted that new cases outside China were the first to appear in China, with new cases in China declining, followed by sudden increases in Italy, Iran and South Korea.
Especially among those with mild symptoms, there may be a high number of cases that are reported.
On 26 February, the number of cases was lowest among young people, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of the global total.Patrick Valance, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimates that 60% of the population would need to be infected with the virus if herd immunity is to develop.
Cases are defined as the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test results are positive according to the established protocol.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population. Many countries, such as Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland, had official policies not to test for low-symptom patients.
A study published on March 16 shows that as of January 23, about 86% of COVID-19 infections in China had not been detected and these undetected infections were the source of infection in 79% of those diagnosed.
According to a report published on March 30, the number of cases in Italy is estimated to be higher than the combined figure.
The initial baseline estimates of COVID-19 prevalence (R0) were 1.4 to 2.4.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released a possible 5.7 severity.
Many people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For non-infected patients, the time from onset of symptoms to death ranges from 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been reported due to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, nearly 80% of deaths were among those over 60 years of age, and 75% were due to other chronic health conditions, including heart disease and diabetes.The estimated COVID-19 deaths are those confirmed by official protocols as COVID-positive.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 is likely to be higher as it does not take into account those who died at home, in care facilities, etc. without being tested.
Data from Italy shows that the death toll during the pandemic is 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that ""we have long anticipated the death toll"", a statement that is further understated by the U.S. estimates of the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.The first confirmed case was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020".
The first death recorded outside mainland China was in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths have been reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy, respectively, outside mainland China.
On March 13, more than forty countries and territories from all continents reported deaths in the Antarctic.
These figures vary by region and time, depending on reported test volumes, sanitation systems, treatment options, time since the start of the pandemic, and demographic factors such as age, gender, and overall health.
The global mortality and morbidity ratio is 6.0% ((97,039/1,617,204), according to statistics from the Johns Hopkins University as of April 10, 2020.
The numbers are divided by region.
The relative mortality rate for those with symptoms in China has dropped from 17.3% (as of January 1-10th, 2020) to 0.7% (as of February 1st, 2020). Other parameters include the death rate, i.e. the death rate of infected individuals as a percentage of the infected population, and the death rate of infected individuals, i.e. the death rate as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals as a percentage of the infected individuals.
These statistics are not time-bound, but are based on population density in relation to the number of cases of infection.
Many scholars have tried to work out these numbers in a specific population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates the infectious mortality rate of the pandemic to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimates of the range are consistent with the results of the emergency COVID-19 tests in Germany, which are statistically robust and study the impact of CFR testing.
WHO says the pandemic can be brought under control.
The duration of the pandemic and how long it will continue is unknown, and varies from place to place.
Massachusetts Boney of Penn State University says that although there is no control, infectious diseases are increasingly becoming scarce after the spread of measles.
However, it is not possible to make an accurate prediction at this time of day as to when this will happen.
"The Chinese government's senior medical adviser, Zhang Nanshan, has argued that if all countries are encouraged to follow the advice of the World Health Organization on measures to contain the pandemic, ""the June pandemic could be eradicated"."
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found SARS-CoV-2 to be one to two years old.
According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing is necessary for other measures and vaccination collection within 18 months of delivery.
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: ""This coronavirus is so fast-moving that it will not completely disappear"" and that ""it may be seasonal, recurring, year-round"."
Again, the issue of compatibility is based on community prevention and spread of the virus.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are not particularly distinctive, and people infected with the virus may not show any symptoms.
Fever (88%) and dry cough (68%) are the most common symptoms.
Many uncommon symptoms of fatigue include fluid leakage from the respiratory system, difficulty in swallowing, shortness of breath, joint and jaw pain, sore throat, headache, tremor, vomiting, hemoptysis, cyanosis, and the effects of diarrhea. According to the World Health Organization, one in six people may develop severe respiratory problems.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released a list of emergency symptoms, including shortness of breath, persistent pain or chest pains, and palpitations, including movement stiffness and a sore nose or face.
Some of those infected may not show any symptoms, meaning they do not show any clinical signs but tests confirm the presence of infection. Therefore, researchers recommend that people who have had close contact with a confirmed case should be closely monitored and tested for the presence of infection.
China's unsigned minority population is expected to reach 44%.
The average incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) is usually five days, but varies from one to 14 days.As an example of uncertainty, the average number of COVID-19 patients who lost their sense of smell has dropped from the initial 30% to 15%.
The details of how the disease is transmitted are still being studied.
The disease is primarily transmitted by close contact, less than 1-2 meters (3-6 feet) away, or by particles that are invisible to the eye when you chew, swallow, or speak.
Studies have shown that the uncovered seams can travel from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Although the virus is not airborne, some suggest that the virus may be transmitted by small, long-term airborne parasites that can be produced during speech.
These substances may be inhaled into the mouth or nose of people in close proximity or enter the lungs.
Some therapeutic procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), treat the respiratory system by mixing the air with the airborne virus.
The virus can be transmitted by touching contaminated objects or organs such as skin, eyes, nose, or mouth.
There are fears that it could be transmitted through the Earth's atmosphere, but the risk is very low.
The Chinese government will assess the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via landforms.The virus is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms appear, but may continue to spread in the later stages of the disease before symptoms appear.
People can be diagnosed with the disease three days before they develop symptoms, which means there is no sign of infection.
"Leboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases are rare, but studies show that in certain countries, they can be transmitted without symptoms".
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimates that one person may kill two or three people, although the exact mode of transmission is not known.The virus can persist on the surface of the body for hours to days.
The virus can be detected in three layers of plastic (polypropylene), 304 stainless steel, cardboard for one day and copper for four hours.
However, this is driven by the heat and humidity.Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
British authorities have said that even if you wash your hands after touching infected property, there is no evidence that the virus is transmitted from animals to humans.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus type 2, first identified in three cases of pneumonia in people with severe respiratory problems in Wuhan.
All forms of the newly mutated SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in similar natural coronaviruses. External respiration can kill the virus by rupturing the protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the former SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have originated from animals.
Genetic studies have determined that the coronavirus is genetically related to the betacoronavirus, and at the genus level to other mosquito-borne viruses and to the subgenus sarbecovirus (lineage B).
BatCov RaTG13 is 96% identical to other TB coronaviruses at full genome levels.
Chinese researchers found in February 2020 that viruses in humans and pangolins differ only in one amino acid.
Complete genetic similarities show that at least 92% of the genetic elements between pangolin and coronavirus are similar to SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to confirm that pangolin is a mediator.
If detection of the virus is possible, it should be confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests or CT imaging.
A study in Wuhan comparing PCR and CT shows that CT is more effective at detecting the disease than PCR, but it cannot distinguish it from other types of pneumonia and diseases.
"Starting in March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that ""CT should not be used as an initial screening test for COVID-19""".
Several protocols for SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing have been published by WHO.The first was published on Nov. 17.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on a sample of blood or urine.
The results are usually available within a few hours to days.
In general, this test can be performed with nasal swabs and a sternum swab as well as a throat swab.Antibiotic tests are also being developed in the blood by selected laboratories and companies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these has been sufficiently verified for widespread use.
Certified laboratories for Cellex's antiviral testing in the US are allowed to be used for emergency services.
Radiographs and CT images taken of the asymmetrical peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusions of the asymptomatic individuals show symptoms.
Imaging results of confirmed patients are distributed via the World Wide Web and are prepared by the Italian Society of Radiology.
As it can be similar to other infectious diseases such as adenovirus, it cannot be detected by PCR alone.
Extensive studies in China have shown that the ability to distinguish the epidemic from other diseases is low, although the results of oral cardiac CT compared to PCR are high, suggesting that screening tools can be used in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks are being developed that can display images of the virus captured by both radiographs and CT.
Physical hygiene: washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with hand sanitizer, and climbing or spitting on the sofa and then properly placing the sofa are some of the steps to prevent the spread of infection.
People who may be affected by the contamination are advised to wear surgical masks when in public.
While physical distancing measures are recommended to prevent transmission, most governments have issued a warning to all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the pandemic.
However, the virus has reached a community-level epidemic in most countries around the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members are unsure where and how they will be transmitted.Health professionals who treat people with obesity are advised to take appropriate precautions, including eye contact precautions and eye contact warnings.The preparation of an eye contact is essential for the health of the body to identify the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
The independence of governments in using local data from mobile phones has been questioned, with Amnesty International and 100 other organisations issuing statements calling for similar border attacks to be stopped.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or made available for voluntary use; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen professional teams have developed privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to transfer user contact to other phones.
Then, if the staff has close contact with a person infected with COVID-19, messages are sent. The misguided ideas about how to prevent infection, such as washing the throat with water and flushing the nose with a facial, are not effective.
Although several companies are working on developing a vaccine for COVID-19, it is not yet available.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the virus.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands continuously with soap and water for at least 10 seconds, especially after using the toilet or if there is no visible dirt, before eating and after urinating, and after coughing.
This can kill the virus outside the body by injecting the body's own protective soap.
The CDC also recommends using alcohol-based sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content when soap and water are not available.
WHO advises people not to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth with bare hands.
Body surfaces can be free of bacteria by various chemicals (stainless steel within one minute after antibacterial exposure): 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone-iodine.
Others, such as benzalkonium chloride, have reduced activity in the synthesis of chromexide and glucose.
CDC recommends that any facility, such as a COVID office, child care center, all office suites, restrooms, shared areas, shared tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, ATM machines, and electronic devices should be disinfected and disinfected during the use of infected persons.
Health experts recommend people cover their mouths, noses and hands with a handkerchief while painting or coughing and to keep used soap in their hands.
People who are sick are advised to wear a medical mask. Wearing a mask is useful for breathing, breathing and breathing while speaking, and to prevent the spread of airborne particles.
WHO issues guidelines on when and how to use face masks.
Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, recommends that people wear masks to avoid contact with faces, as the government's main recommendation is to avoid touching faces with unwashed hands.
WHO recommends that people who are healthy, caring for COVID-19 patients, wear face masks only if their risk is high, although it is generally accepted that wearing a face mask may prevent people from covering their face.
Many countries are encouraging the use of face masks for members of the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of non-medical fabric face masks; China recommends disposable medical masks, especially those used by healthy community members, to be worn separately and in close proximity to others (less than 1 meter (3 feet) in length).
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks during public transportation hours and in public places.
Thai medical experts encourage people to make their own face masks at home and use them while bathing.
Czech Republic and Slovakia ban masks and masks from public places.
On March 16, Vietnam called for all people to wear face masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government orders that anyone entering a beverage grocery store must wear a face and nose mask.
Israel asks all residents to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing tens of millions of masks for its own use since mid-March, requires all passengers on trains and city buses to wear masks from April 1.
Panama makes it mandatory to wear face masks while outdoors, and urges home-made masks for those who cannot afford face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (i.e. physical distancing) includes contagion control to reduce the spread of TB by eliminating close contact.
Restrictions, travel restrictions, and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas, and shopping malls are some of the measures that could be taken.
Individuals can practice social distancing by staying at home, reducing travel, avoiding public gatherings, exchanging non-smoking greetings, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Many governments have issued guidelines for social distancing in areas affected by the pandemic.
The maximum number of people in the United States, recommended by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has been reduced from 250 to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned outdoor gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and people with chronic internal diseases such as diabetes, heart failure, respiratory diseases, high blood pressure and a weakened immune system are at greater risk of contracting and contracting the disease.
The use of the term social distancing, which is used in place of other alternatives to contacting other people, has led to a trend toward social distancing.Some officials have ordered sexual health guidelines to be implemented at this early stage.
They recommend that sexual contact should be with someone who is not infected or has no symptoms of the virus.
It is recommended that those who are infected with COVID-19 and suspect they may be infected, have their mates at home.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidelines for the quarantine.Many governments have issued orders or have been urged to quarantine all people living in affected areas.
The stronger self-isolation guidelines have been announced for high-risk groups.
Those who have been in contact with a person with COVID-19 and have recently returned from a country with high prevalence are advised to quarantine at home for 14 days from the last contact.
Measures to control the epidemic include containment, containment and containment.
Initial vaccination is a measure to track and identify those infected, along with other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
While efforts to contain the spread of the virus have been stalled, measures are being taken to reduce the spread and the impact on the health care system in the community.
They can work together using control and understanding.
The spread of the virus needs to be reduced to below 1 and strict measures to eliminate the virus.
This will allow more time for the development of vaccines and treatments, reducing the risk of healthcare providers providing over-supplied services.
These measures include personal precautions such as hand washing, masks and self-isolation, social distancing measures such as closing schools and gathering places, and partial sanitation. Improved precautions such as city lockdowns and travel restrictions have been implemented in response to the growing impact of the pandemic in China.
Other countries are also working on different guidelines to control the spread of the virus.
South Korea has issued a warning on the movement of individuals as it imposes mass cleansing and environmental quarantine.
Singapore provides grants to those who have been infected and quarantined, and imposes heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased its production of face masks and imposed restrictions on medical dispensers.The UK and US will face major challenges in the distribution of vaccines (which will reduce but not stop the spread of the epidemic) to the countries that are likely to face the challenge of a reversal of the pandemic's spread.
The balanced vaccination policies have reduced medical care by two-thirds and deaths by a third, while hundreds of thousands of deaths and treatment overload are seen.
Restrictions may be necessary, but the spread of the virus within populations must continue to be contained (as soon as vaccines are available, if available earlier), as the pandemic may recur if restrictions are lifted.
Measures to contain the pandemic could lead to social and economic disruption.
Currently, there is no effective antiviral drug for COVID-19, but it is being developed and tested with existing drugs.
Taking flu medications, taking fluids, and taking rest may alleviate the symptoms.
Depending on the weight, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can have side effects.
The role of previously approved antiviral drugs for other viruses in the treatment of COVID-19 is being studied.
The World Health Organization has stated that "some traditional and household disinfectants" may be involved in detecting symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Building capacity and upgrading health care facilities to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients is a critical element in the response to the pandemic, according to WHO.
ECDC and the WHO Office in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and healthcare institutions. The document outlines how healthcare institutions can use their limited resources to provide laboratory services focused on COVID-19 detection, dismantling non-emergency operations, identifying COVID-19 patients, reducing intensive care capacity, and reducing the number of beds and ventilators.
There is much speculation as to where the first case (called patient zero) originated.
The first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China on December 1, 2019.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has surged.
The virus is thought to have evolved from these animals. A large number of people with lung infections were diagnosed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian of Hubei Hospital on December 26.
On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about the coronavirus, which is similar to SARS.
Eight of these doctors were arrested by the police for spreading false information in the name of Li Wenliang. Ai Feng was also executed for her part in the world's disclosure.
The Wuhan Health Commission issued a public statement on December 31 and informed the WHO.
In early January, enough unidentified cases of pneumonia were reported to Wuhan health officials to begin testing.In the early days of the epidemic, the number of cases would double in seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other regions of China, aided by Chinese New Year travel, as Wuhan is a transportation hub and major railway junction.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had symptoms. By March 26, government reports had surpassed the number of cases reported in China and Italy. By April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, with more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 people recovered.
At least one case has been reported in 200 countries and territories.
Due to the pandemic, many Schengen members in Europe have imposed border controls to prevent free movement.
The national response to the pandemic includes lockdowns (i.e., staying at home or in your shelter or closing down cities) and early lockdowns. As of April 2, some 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the U.S. population, were in some form of lockdown. More than 50 million people were in lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people were under lockdown. Two days later, that number rose to 2.6 billion - about one-third of the world's population.
The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on December 1, 2019, but an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was on November 17.
Dr. Jang Jixian was diagnosed with a rare case of pneumonia on December 26, and the hospital where she works visited Wuhan Jiangsu CDC on December 27.
Genetic testing of patients on December 27, 2019 found a coronavirus similar to SARS.
A public statement was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commissioner on December 31.
The World Health Organization (WHO) received the information on the same day.
"As these statements were made, doctors in Wuhan received a police warning that they were "in a state of epidemic".
China's National Health Commission says there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.
"At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a crackdown on the virus, later dubbed the "People's War" by Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping".
"The "greatest hygiene crisis in human history", which was declared on January 23, has spread to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting 57 million people".
private cars were banned in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) festivities have been cancelled in many places.
The provisional hospital, Huoshenshun Hospital, was completed in 10 days, officials said.
A second hospital, the Leichenshausen Hospital, was later built to boost the capacity of the patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also converted 14 other service facilities such as conference rooms and stadiums in Wuhan into temporary hospitals.On January 26, the government took measures such as issuing health declarations for travelers and postponing the Spring Festivals, which it said could help control the COVID-19 epidemic.
Universities and schools across the country have also been closed.
Hong Kong and Macau have taken several steps, especially with regard to schools and universities.
China has imposed measures to work remotely in limited areas.
Travel from and to Hubei is prohibited.
Public transportation improved, and museums temporarily closed in China.
"Controls on public movement are in place in most cities, with around 760 million people (half of the population) subjected to some form of outdoor restrictions.Before the pandemic reached global scale in March, Chinese authorities took effective measures to "prevent the virus from entering from other countries".
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day quarantine on all international travellers entering the city.On March 23, only one case of domestic transmission was detected in five days in mainland China, and that was a senior citizen who returned from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that the spread of the virus in the country would be halted in principle and the epidemic would be brought under control in China.
Outside of Wuhan, two months after the lockdown, travel restrictions in Hubei were eased on the same day, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020, that as of March 28, all entry for visa holders and residency permit holders would be suspended, without providing details on when this policy would end.
Those who wish to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies and consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged financial support for the reopening of factories and businesses by March 30.A three-minute silence and a day of mourning were declared by the State Consulate at 10:00 am on April 4.
COVID-19 is confirmed to have been introduced to South Korea from China on January 20, 2020.
The country's health agency said that the number of confirmed cases on February 20 has increased due to a new religious gathering at Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu.
There are suspicions that the origin of the epidemic is the Shinchengyi pilgrims from Wuhan to Daegu.
As of February 22, 1,261 of the 9,336 churchgoers, or 13%, reported symptoms. South Korea declared a state of emergency on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, with a total of 3,150 cases on February 29.
All South Korean military bases are under lockdown after three South Korean soldiers tested positive for the virus.
Airline schedules have also changed as a result of the impact.South Korea has embarked on the world's largest and most sophisticated community-based virus screening program, isolating those infected and seeking asylum from those who have been in contact with the infected.
Signs of the new international travellers who are critical to clean up the roads include mobile app signals that will be tested on the next day, and daily road tests that will increase the daily testing capacity to 20,000.
South Korea's response to the pandemic is considered successful, even without nationwide lockdowns.
Many Koreans are holding signing rallies to celebrate Moon, or to celebrate the government's handling of the pandemic.
On March 23, South Korea recorded its lowest daily cases in four weeks.
On March 29, all new foreign visitors will be quarantined for two weeks from April 1.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has requested investigative assistance from 121 different countries.
Iran announced the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Komi on February 19, and later, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died on the same day.
Previous measures taken by the government include cancellation of concerts and cultural performances, Friday prayers, closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani announced on February 26, 2020, that there are no plans to evacuate individuals from areas affected by the pandemic.
Intercity travel destinations were scheduled for March, but heavy traffic between cities continued ahead of the Persian New Year.
Standing tea boxes will remain open for worshippers until March 16, 2020, after China emerged as the epicenter of the pandemic in February.
Following the efforts to contain the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries have taken their cases to Iran as of February 28, indicating the spread of the outbreak is likely to be higher than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government.
Iran's parliament suspends its work.23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on Iranian prison officials to release those detained for peacefully expressing dissent without any preconditions, and to release the other detainees concerned on a provisional basis.
Closed facilities with inadequate medical care, such as prisons, pose a greater risk of spreading the virus.
On March 15, Iranian officials reported 100 deaths in one day, the highest number since the pandemic began.
At least 12 former Iranian politicians and officials died from the disease on March 17.
Iran reported 50 new cases and one new death every hour due to coronavirus on March 23.
WHO official says the number of cases in Iran may be five times higher than officially reported.
In addition, the US sanctions on Iran are severely affecting the country's economic ability to control the spread of the virus.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for easing economic sanctions on countries affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The pandemic entered Italy on January 31 after two Chinese visitors to Rome tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
As cases began to escalate, the Italian government declared a state of emergency, suspending all flights to China.
16 confirmed cases in Lombardy began to be detected on February 21, following the unrelated spread of COVID-19 cases.On February 22, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree to control the outbreak, which includes 50,000 quarantined from 11 different cities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said that there will be no evil in the places where the pandemic is occurring, entering and leaving.
"Suspicions related to work and sports activities in the area have been taken into account"."On March 4, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country, as the death toll in the country reached 100"."
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, will be held on lockdown from April, however on March 9, all sporting events will be suspended for at least a month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the closure of almost all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies.On March 6, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published a medical ethics report on the Triad protocols that may be used.
Italy surpassed China as the deadliest country in the pandemic after 3,405 deaths on March 19.
on march 22, russia will send nine military aircraft with medical supplies to italy.
As of April 5, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries, mostly in the Lombardy region.
CNN reports that Italy's large orphan population and the inability to rapidly test all people with the virus are contributing to the high mortality rate.
The UK's initial response to the outbreak was described as lukewarm, with the UK government not implementing any mass quarantine measures for its citizens as of 18 March 2020.
As a result, the government has faced criticism for its lack of response to the threat posed to the community.On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to stay at home as much as possible and avoid going to bars, restaurants and theaters, suspending all non-essential travel and social contacts.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure facilities such as pubs, gyms, and bars would close as soon as possible, and promised to pay 80% of their salaries to workers, up to a limit of £2,500, to prevent unemployment during this crisis.On March 23, the Prime Minister announced more stringent measures such as a ban on gatherings of more than two people, travel and restrictions on social distancing activities in the open air.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions are enforced by police force through fines and dispersed gatherings.
"Most businesses have been ordered to close, except for those identified as ""essential"" such as supermarkets, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages".

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) against SARS-CoV-2 virus include the development of pathways that produce antibodies that are involved in the virus' response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, as the coronavirus has RNA.
This test is specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA and is only performed on cells.
It is used to detect recent infections.
Serology is useful for screening and public health.
Antibody tests show how many people have been infected, including those with very minor or no symptoms.
The exact mortality rate and herd immunity levels are determined by the results of these tests.
Due to limited testing, no country has reliable data on the spread of the pandemic in their population as of March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and the methods of testing vary widely across countries.
This number also seems to be significantly affecting the reported deaths, which in some countries are seen to be higher than expected.
The test can be carried out using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test using various methods including respiratory system samples, nasopharyngeal swab or a mouse sample.
Results will be available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed by the swallowtail is reliable in the first week of the disease.
In the later stages, the virus can spread through the lungs and disappear in the throat.
In infected individuals who have been tested for the second week, a suction catheter or a suction catheter (s) can be used as a selective sample material from the respiratory tract.

"A March 2020 review of the literature said that ""oral cardiac radiographs are less effective at detecting the disease in the early stages of the disease, but CT [computed tomography] can also detect it before symptoms develop"."
Common features seen in CT are a double multilobular grass-like projection into a distant, asymmetrical posterior organ.
Subplural hyperplasia, squamous cell carcinoma and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
In a study of the origins of the current pandemic and the PCR-CT comparison, CT is more likely to detect disease than PCR, but it is not clear which disease, most of which are similar to pneumonia and other diseases.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be considered as an initial alternative to early-stage COVID-19 testing"" and, as of March 2020, CDC recommended PCR as the primary alternative".
The immune system's response to attack the disease includes IgM to IgG to form antibodies.
These are used to monitor the general population for infection, to ensure that they are not infected, within 7 days or so after symptoms begin.Testing is done at the Central Laboratory Testing (CLT) or Point of Care Testing (PoCT).
Highly automated systems can perform these tests in most clinical laboratories, but their products may be supported by internal system guidance ratings.
Although serial samples are used to monitor immunity, CLT is traditionally used as a blood sample.
PoCT is a blood test that is usually done by injecting a needle into the skin.
No pre-testing is required, such as PCR extraction methods.On March 26, 2020, the FDA requested 29 companies to notify the agency and thus now be able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA for emergency use.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received approval for their diagnostic kits, which use IgG and IgA from blood samples against the virus to detect antibodies.
The testing capacity of several hundred samples is tested within hours, making it much faster than the conventional viral RNA PCR test.
These antibodies are usually identified 14 days after infection.In early April, the UK confirmed that antibody kits grown in the UK were not fit for use.
"Hong Kong has developed a method for suspected patients to stay at home, with the emergency department 'giving the patient a test tube sample', and the results will be released later".The British NHS said it will begin a method of treating suspected cases at home, to reduce the spread of the disease when people arrive at the hospital or to reduce the need for ambulance disinfection, with COVID-19 testing of suspected patients in your car and in the services of health and human services, as a precautionary measure".
Street testing centers have enabled South Korea to perform the fastest, most rigorous tests of any country in the world.The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance in Germany announced on March 2 that health professionals will be able to perform 12,000 tests per day via mobile devices, with a further 10,700 tests in the past few weeks.
If the test is prescribed by a doctor, the cost is covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general requirement of 160,000 tests per week.
From March 19, vehicle inspections are being carried out in many cities.
The overall test in Germany as of 26 March 2020 is unknown, as only positive tests are being reported.
"The first lab trial started in the calendar week of 12/2020 and a total of 483,295 samples were tested by 12/2020, with 33,491 samples (6.9%) showing positive results for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, a study conducted by Technion-Medical Research Institute for Rambam Hospital and 64 patient samples tested a method of simultaneously testing samples, which allows the samples to be tested further only if the recovered samples are positive.The 2000-square-meter endowed laboratory of the "Huo-Yan" (Huo-Yan, Fire Eye, or Fire Eye) opened in February 2020 with more than 10,000 BGI in the facility, which is located in the city of Beijing".
The building took five days, according to BGI founder Wang Jian.If this testing capacity had not been developed, Hubei's cases would have been 47% higher than the current level, and the cost of surveillance and quarantine could have doubled.
The Wuhan test is followed by the Huo-Yan tests of Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
On 4 March 2020, daily tests totaled 50,000 tests per day.Source: Origami Tests' design allows for the testing of more than 1,122 COVID-19 patients in just 93 labs.These integrated designs can be performed in small laboratories without the assistance of robotic fluids.
In March, there was a great deal of pressure on the EU to investigate the UK and US for regent deficiencies and inadequacies.
This led one author to review the sampling protocols, including heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to heat up RNA genomes for better detection.On 31 March, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was reported to have the largest population-based coronavirus test of any country, and the largest population-based test of any country.
"With the help of the In Your Car service, the Population Scale is a collaboration from Group 42 Laboratories and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" randomized controlled trials in China)".
Built in 14 days, this lab can perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests in a single day, the first time this has ever been done outside of China.
Several test orders comparing different genetic features of the coronavirus are issued in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has approved German kits exported to low-income countries that cannot produce themselves.
The German vaccine was published on January 17, 2020, and the U.S. disease control protocol was not available until January 28, causing delays in testing.China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of test kits at the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet the medical experts' demand.
In comparison, South Korea's large-scale testing kit has reduced the spread of the new coronavirus.
Testing capabilities, mostly at Glee Laboratories, have been developed by the South Korean government for many years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for testing programs to be successful in reducing COVID-19.High testing questions are being raised as hundreds of thousands of individual tests are conducted at U.S. testing sites, and as supplies of swabs and chemical reagents are in short supply.
In March 2020, China reported a false positive for the test kit.
"In the United States, the diagnostic kits developed by the CDC had ""problems""; the government then lifted bureaucratic restrictions that prevented the testing of individual treatments.Spain purchased the diagnostic kits from China's Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, which confirmed that their results were unreliable".
The agency said the incorrect results could be due to problems with sampling or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish Ministry has removed counterfeit kits, saying it uses other test kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of these test kits from the Czech Republic have been counterfeited, larger than China.Slovakia has imported 1.2 million kits from China and found them to be counterfeit.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested this be dumped into the Danube.Ateş Kara said the Turkish Health Ministry had reported that the test kits that Turkey had imported from China had a "high error rate" and "were not used".UK reported that 3.5 million test kits imported from China in early April 2020 were not used for any purpose".
Testing, positive outcomes and follow-up of people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 have shown positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, Italy's first COVID-19 death site, conducted two rounds of testing on 3,400 people, separated by ten days.
About half of the positive results are asymptomatic, and all cases have been cleared.
By restricting travel to the coma, this can prevent new infections.
With strict curfews, travel restrictions, testing and lockdowns, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic was significantly lower in Singapore than in other developing countries, which was made possible by the needless closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Most arrangements have been cancelled, with Singapore starting to lock in residents on March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 after the holiday holiday.
Several other countries have managed to contain the pandemic with strong surveillance, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but less important lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistics show that countries with more tests have lower death rates compared to the death rate, due to the inability of these countries to distinguish between people with mild and no symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) advises countries with national laboratories that lack testing capacity and experience in COVID-19 testing to send the initial five positive and ten negative COVID-19 test results to the 16 WHO Referral Laboratories.
16 of the reference trials are located in Asia, 7 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the positive percentage of tests is determined by the country's testing policy.
A country only tests people who come to the hospital, a country tests all its citizens, a country has more positive tests per percent, regardless of whether they show symptoms, and other factors are the same.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand sanitization, is the practice of cleaning your hands to remove dust, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances from your hands.
"Washing your hands with soap during the day at ""critical times"" reduces the transmission of many diseases, such as measles and cholera, which are diseases transmitted by the mouth and throat".
People can also contract respiratory diseases, such as eye, nose, or mouth (e.g., mucous membranes) if they do not wash their hands before touching them.
The five most important times to wash your hands with soap each day are before and after you test, after you wash your baby's bladder or change a napkin, before you feed your baby, before you eat and before you prepare raw meat, fish, and milk.
If soap and water are not available, you can wash your hands with a hand sanitizer. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing.
before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing or cleaning used baby diapers.
Squeezing, sneezing, or sneezing after your nose.
After chewing, feeding, or chewing animal droppings.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygienic practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main purpose of handwashing is to keep hands clean of pathogens (bacterial, viral, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially useful for people who handle food or work in the medical field, and it is also useful for the general public.
Washing your hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the causes of respiratory infections; and reducing respiratory system infections;
Reducing the death rate of home births.
A 2013 study found that frequent hand washing practices lead to minor improvements in the length of children under five years of age.
In tropical countries, the infant mortality rate due to respiratory and infectious diseases can be reduced by simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce deaths from the disease by 50%.
Handwashing procedures reduce the incidence of seizures by about a third, which is comparable to hygiene in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap and water is the most common and effective option for preventing seizures and respiratory infections in schools, governments and communities.
Pneumonia, severe ARI, is the number one killer of children under five, claiming the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
Each year, 3.5 million children die from pneumonia.
UNICEF says that using soap and water before eating and after using the toilet can save lives, reduce the spread of communicable diseases and reduce deaths from respiratory tract infections by as much as four times, in addition to vaccination and treatment.
Hand washing is often combined with other hygiene activities such as water body, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Washing your hands also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Washing hands has a minor critical effect; washing hands repeatedly can dry the skin and lead to the deterioration of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that frequent hand washing can lead to a condition called gout, dry skin eczema, or hand dermatitis, which is common among health care workers.
Washing your hands too often is considered a sign of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).
There are five limiting handwashing rounds per day to reduce the risk of oral transmission of the disease: after using the toilet (after chewing, coughing), after urinating (after changing nappies), before feeding children, before eating and before/after preparing food or raw meat, fish, or milk.
Hand washing techniques are also needed in other situations to prevent transmission of the disease, including before and after wound healing; after bathing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after chewing animal waste or touching animals; and after chewing garbage.
In many countries, washing hands with soap and water is considered a normal practice.
A handwashing survey was conducted in 54 countries in 2015, with an average of 38.7% of households using handwashing with soap.A 2014 study found Saudi Arabia with the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States with an average of nearly 77 percent; China with the lowest rate of 23 percent.Various behavioral modification methods have been used to promote behavioral change in handwashing habits in developing countries.
"The "Critical Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education is an example of the scale of action taken in the Philippines to strengthen children's health and education".
The two-year, daily handwashing with soap, and daily tooth brushing with fluoride are the main objectives of the national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Microbial removal from the skin is done by soaking the skin with soap and detergent.
The main function of soap and detergent is to reduce the limitations of sputum and increase the effectiveness.
Water alone is not an adequate skin cleanser, because fats and proteins, which are the basic building blocks of life, are not only purified by water.
Cleanup, however, supported by reasonable water resources.
Dry soap, which is reusable in nature, can retain bacteria from previous use.
Several studies have shown that the spread of bacteria from contaminated soil is minimal because the bacteria are destroyed by the soil.
"CDC has so far recommended that ""liquid soap is preferred for use without washing hands"."
Antibacterial soaps are being heavily distributed to the health-conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of these common antiseptics or disinfectants is beneficial to naturally antibiotic resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain antibacterial agents such as triclosan, and many have a list of strains that are resistant to this.
Therefore, although antibiotic resistant strains are not selected by the antibacterial soap, they may not be as effective as needed.
Along with the skin protective agent, this complex formulation may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH ratios, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and additional skin conditioners (alloy vera, vitamins, methanol, plant extracts).
Hot water to wash your hands is hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow rapidly at a body temperature of 37°C.
However, warm, soapy water is effective in removing the natural oils that contain dust and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using clean water is not effective in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand sanitizers or hand sanitizing agents without water or hand antiseptic.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic hand sanitizer combinations (alcoholic hand sanitizer, antiseptic hand sanitizer, or sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most isopyl alcohols or ethanol are gel-like with a solvent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer), or humicant such as glycerin and liquid, or to reduce the alcohol's oxidative effect.
The use of recycled hydrogen peroxide increases additional antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective germ killers.
Alcoholic sanitizers kill bacteria, various drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccina, influenza, and hepatitis), as well as fungus.
Alcoholic sanitizers with 70% alcohol content kill the bacteria within 30 seconds of applying them, 99.99% charge and 99.999% charge (4 to 5 N log reduction) within 1 minute of applying the bacteria to your hand. Hand sanitizers are effective against bacteria but not as effective against individual viruses.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers against Norwalk type viruses, the most common infectious gastrointestinal disease. Cut your hands or both hands to ensure you have enough hand antiseptic or alcohol staging.
Keep the liquid, paste, or gel dry for up to 30 seconds, with both hands in front, back, and between the fingers.
The tips of the fingers should be washed properly, with both hands covered.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands above sanitizer platforms, especially if there is visible dirt on your hands.
The greatest benefit of these agents is their ease of use and quick killing of microorganisms; however, proper hand washing should not be substituted for the availability of soap and water.
Repeated use of alcohol-containing hand sanitizers can cause dry skin, so the sputum and/or skin wipes should be treated to the formula.
The fermentation effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other substitutes to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-containing sanitizers contained a syringe and had a lower chance of skin degradation and decomposition compared to soaps and antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic rhinitis, urethritis syndrome and hypersensitivity to alcohol and other alcohol-related reactions are commonly avoided.
The comparison of washing with soap and water to reduce the development of irritated dermatitis of the palms of the hands.
Regardless of their usefulness, non-water agents cannot clean organic materials from the hands, they can only make them clean.
This is why hand sanitizers are less effective than soap and water in preventing the transmission of many pathogens, as pathogens can linger on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is highly dependent on their ingredients and formulation, and has historically been considered to be a sub-alcoholic hand sanitizer.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown sustained and cumulative antimyrobial activity, but after repeated washing, its effectiveness has decreased, which can be a side effect on the skin.
Many people in low income communities cannot afford soap, so they use a garbage or dust bin instead.
It is better to use a towel or a dust dryer than just water, but it is more effective than soap.
The soil or soil is not a threat to the spread of the virus, as it can reduce it and multiply it.
Like soap, cotton is a disinfectant agent in combination with water, as it creates alkaline in the soap.
The World Health Organization suggests that where soap is not available, it is possible to use soap or sand as a substitute for soap.
The US Centers for Disease Control's accurate handwashing technique includes the following steps to reduce the spread of the disease:
Wash your hands with hot or cold water.
Flowing water is recommended because standing basins can be measured, the temperature of the water does not make a difference.
Wash your hands thoroughly with plenty of soap, including the waist, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash more often with soap than with water alone.
Cut it for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing your hands causes dilation, helps to remove germs from your skin, and eliminates many germs for a longer period of time.
Hands are raised under running water.
It can be useful in hand washing.
Wash your hands with a clean towel or air conditioner.
The most commonly forgotten parts of the hands are the thumb, the palm, the area between the fingers, and the inside of the palm.
Artificial tablets and painting tablets can contain microorganisms.
Dry skin increases the risk of transmission of disease, so it is recommended to use hand lotion to prevent dry hands.
"Various low-cost options can be offered to promote hand washing in the absence of coffee water and/or soap, for example, by drawing or splashing water from a hanging jar, or by using a tap if necessary in tropical countries. In situations where water supply is scarce (such as schools or rural areas in tropical countries), water conservation solutions exist, such as "tippy-taps" and low-cost tappers".
tippy-tap is a simple technology that works by using a rope-bound jog, which can be operated by rubbing a small amount of water and soap into your hands with your feet.
Proper hand washing is an essential part of hand hygiene, but hand washing in public toilets is controversial.
Several studies have shown that paper towels are more effective than electric hand towels.
In 2008, a study was conducted at the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the European Soft Paper Towel Manufacturers Symposium, comparing the hygiene of paper towels with the hygiene of modern jet air platforms.
Washing hands with a warm air platform, the overall number of bacteria in the pads of the fingers increased by 194% and in the palm by 254%.
The overall average risk of bacterial death from jet-platform hand injuries is 42% for finger pads and 15% for the palm.
After washing hands with paper towels, the overall bacterial count decreased by an average of 76% in the pads of the fingers and 77% in the stomach of the hand.
The jet-air platform, which blows air from the unit at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), can lift microorganisms from the hands and infect other toilet areas, and can inflate the toilet area to a depth of up to 2 meters.
Warm air from the handstand spreads microorganisms within 0.25 meters of the handstand.
Paper towels are not as widely distributed as microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt showed a different method of hand washing.
The following changes in bacterial density have been observed after hand-washing:
There are many different hand towel manufacturers, and hand towels have been compared to paper towels.
It is recommended to wash hands with a turquoise sanitizing softener when soap and water are not available.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis demonstrated his expertise in preventing the transmission of disease in hospitals (in 1846).
electronic devices remind hospital staff to wash their hands.
One study found a decreased infection rate with their use.
The medical manual says that you should wash your hands for at least 15 seconds, and cut the parts of your hands using plenty of soap and water or gel.
Hands should be held together with fingers.
If there is dirt under your fingers, you can remove it with a brush.
It is important to spread germs properly and wipe with a dry towel, as germs can remain in the water on your hands.
After cleaning, use the paper towel to wipe off water (and, if necessary, unlock the door).
This will help you to avoid getting the hands dirty again by rubbing the areas.
The purpose of hand washing in healthcare settings is to prevent the spread of germs and to prevent their transmission to others.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that in most medical settings, a lack of hand washing is unacceptable, with many doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, so they are transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other gentle measures can reduce catheter-related blood vessel infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has implemented standard hand washing and hand-washing procedures in health care departments.
This incomplete hand hygiene guide prepared by the organizations can be found for public viewing on their website.
A review of this was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may display and display hand hygiene, if required by law.
"The World Health Organization has a 'five-step' approach to hand washing", he said.
Blood/body fluid after clotting
Work before the illness; and
"After patient care, adding antiseptic chemicals to soap ("toxic" or "anti-microbial" soaps) will kill the hand wash".
Such lethal measures can be used in most cases before surgery or with antibiotic-resistant organisms. Surgical procedures require a 'squeeze' of the person's hand, which is passed and disposed of without touching your hands, and a bath with a certain amount of chlorhexidine or iodine, sterile towels for the palms of the hands, and sterile towels for the undercarriage of the hands and other sterile instruments at night.
All the scams should be eliminated.
This procedure requires washing your hands to the elbows, usually for 2-6 minutes.
No need to cook for long periods (10 minutes).
If the upper part of the hand is exposed, care should be taken not to allow water to enter the hands.
After washing your hands, wash your hands with a sterile, dry towel and remove your surgical towel.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash your hands or use antiseptic before and after contact with an infected person.
In controlling staphylococcal infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit of hand sanitization has been found in the first 20% of washed hands, with the frequency of hand washing increasing to over 35%.
Washing hands with alcohol reduces bacterial infection by 26% compared to washing hands with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds.
However, water and soap are better at eliminating H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium from alcohol-containing hand stages.Hand hygiene measures in health care may include teaching staff about hand washing, increasing alcohol-containing staging supplies, and providing written and oral reminders to staff.
Further studies are needed to determine which of these treatments is most effective.
In tropical countries, washing your hands with soap is considered a cost-effective, vital tool for maintaining good health and good nutrition.
However, shortages of water, soap or hand washing tools and supplies at home, schools and workplaces make it difficult to develop global hand washing practices.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand washing toilets are scarce in the back of toilets, while there are few options for building your own toilet.
However, the low hand washing rate is the result of a lack of practice and not a shortage of soap and water.
Strengthening handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, create awareness about the benefits of handwashing, and create long-term handwashing habits in the public.
To function properly, it is important to count and monitor.
"A systematic review of 70 studies showed that local handwashing approaches are the best in LMICs, not the social market approaches.The school handwashing model ""Three Star Approach"" by UNICEF provides schools with simpler, less strenuous methods to wash their hands with soap, along with other hygiene elements".
If lower standards are applied, schools may be given a rating of one to three stars.
Building hand toilets can be a handwashing campaign to reduce the disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is a campaign to try to bring about a change in behaviour.Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus, UNICEF has encouraged the creation of handwashing emojis.
One study examined the overall external effectiveness of handwashing in tropical countries in relation to the cessation of DALYs.
However, one reviewer found that handwashing with soap is cost-effective compared to other water and sanitation methods.
"The health benefits of hand washing for people  especially vulnerable populations such as mothers giving birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals  were first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Wenglen, the English "founder of modern sanitation"".
In his time, many people believed that contamination came from a poisonous salt called miasmus.
In 1980, foodborne epidemics and health care-associated infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend improved hand hygiene as a key preventive measure.
The swine flu pandemic in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to awareness of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against infectious diseases in many countries.
"For example, posters with the tag ""Proper Hand Washing Techniques"" are hung next to public toilets and hand washing sinks and are also found in office buildings and German airports".
"This is the idiom ""wash your hands until they're dirty"" - refusing to take responsibility for the utility of anything".
The term "Gospel" is derived from the Bible account of Matthew, in which Pontius Pilate was implicated in the decision to condemn Jesus Christ, but the term is still widely used in English society.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands by force to clear her guilt for the crime she committed and for the crime she encouraged her husband to commit.
People have been found to wash their hands more frequently than others when they remember or think of doing something disorderly, and to value hand washing utensils more than others.
"In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands are limited in their ability to perform other ""cleansing"" remedial actions after such an act, such as volunteering".
The ritual of washing hands, which may involve washing hands with soap and water only, is a practice of many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, Tevilá and Nepali Judaism, the Lavajo Christian and the Ogham Muslim. Religions also recommend hand washing, in some practices, in a casual manner.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam recommend washing hands after using the toilet.
Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam promote washing of hands before eating.
The workplace risk control of COVID-19
COVID-19 workplace risk control means the adoption of workplace safety and risk control measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk assessments are based on the workplace and type of work, the risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the area, and the factors that may be exposing people to a higher risk of developing COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are those with low exposure to the public or coworkers, which include basic prevention measures such as hand washing, keeping workers home when sick, respiratory procedures, and regular workplace cleaning and disinfection.
Medium-risk occupations include those that require frequent direct contact with people suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, but may be interrupted due to ongoing community pandemics or international travel.
This includes workers who work with the general population, such as schools, high-crowd workplaces, and some high-crowd retailers.
Risk Control Team: In addition to basic infection prevention measures, high ventilation usage of air fresheners, respiratory masks and personal protective equipment may be used if anyone is infected with COVID-19.
OSHA reports that health care and funeral workers who have been exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients are at higher risk of exposure if they perform aerosol-producing tests, or collect samples of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Risk management for these workers also includes engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have a lot of repercussions on the workplace.
Employees may skip work because they are sick, care for others, or fear being fired.
Business processes can change in two ways: in terms of supply and in terms of how to get what you want (e.g. shopping at irregular hours or getting service from your car).
Finally, travel restrictions from countries hardest hit by COVID-19 may be lifted.Preparation and response measures for infectious diseases can help to implement preventive measures.
Applications show risk indicators related to workplaces and occupations, including sources of exposure, home and community settings, and levels of risk associated with interpersonal relationships, such as aging or serious medical problems.
To control the situation during the pandemic, the authorities have set up controls to determine the risk and the risk factors.
Prevention and response of infectious diseases is subject to national and subnational advice.
The goals of pandemic response include reducing overpopulation among staff, caring for people who are vulnerable to emerging adverse health conditions, maintaining business operations, and reducing potential side effects in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the location of the business affects the response.
Pre-implantation hazard control is often associated with occupational health and safety, and is a broad category of group hazard control.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be avoided, the best are the so-called engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering calculations are the most cost-effective solution to reduce the risks associated with work for workers without affecting the individual characteristics of the worker.
Administrative controls are policy changes in the workplace or production that require action by the employee or supervisor.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is low compared to engineering and administrative controls, but some lubrication can be useful for protection.
All personal protective equipment is subject to the risk assessment of the worker, if it is properly fitted, properly operated, without interruption, regularly inspected, repaired, replaced, properly disposed as necessary, maintained clean, properly installed to prevent spotting.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are less likely to be vulnerable to public and co-workers' exposure.
Basic prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent hand washing with soap and water, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, respiratory rules such as covering and cleaning the room, providing sofas and garbage disposal, extending telecommunications shifts where necessary, preventing workers from using other people's products and tools, maintaining a clean workplace and maintaining anti-infection practices.
Early identification and isolation of infected individuals for workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace is a critical step in preventing infection.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with severe respiratory problems stay home for up to 24 hours, free of fever, fever symptoms, and symptoms-reducing medications without any anti-inflammatory drugs, or sick leave policies should be in place to prevent employees from infecting a family member at home, and employees should be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, people with potentially vulnerable occupations are those who have work that requires a six-foot (1.8 m) distance to be in regular or close contact with unidentified or suspected COVID-19 patients, but who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 through community transmission in commercial settings, or through travel to countries with widespread COVID-19 outbreaks.
This includes workers with general safety requirements, such as schools, workplaces with high population densities, and some places with high sales barriers. This includes groups with higher exposure and high quality air pollution control, increased ventilation rates, physical restrictions such as clear plastic insulation, and opening windows for children in their cars and shops. This includes the ability to lead a group of workers who have the opportunity to lead a protest, including the ability to conduct training sessions and training sessions, and the ability to maintain a culture of collaboration with employees in the workplace, as well as the ability to conduct extensive meetings about the safety of people who are not receiving COVID-19 vaccinations, such as the development of a COVID-19 vaccination program, the provision of emergency medical equipment, and other work-related activities.
These emergency response team workers do not require the use of respirators.
If someone is sick on an aircraft, appropriate measures to protect staff and passengers include keeping the sick person 6 feet away from others and providing the sick person with a face and nose mask and covering the mouth and nose with a soft cloth during the evacuation.
Cabin crews should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for sick passengers or when staying in areas where body fluids may be contaminated, and personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or respiratory distress.
"Consumer ships, cruise ships and other passenger ships, including emergency controls, if you are sick, traveling, isolating your bed and identifying medical personnel if anyone on board is experiencing fever or other symptoms".
Ideally, medical screenings should be conducted in the isolation cabin of the child.Schools and child care facilities, regardless of community preference, should lock the child away until the child is cleaned and disinfected.
If there is low or moderate social transmission, physical distancing methods should be implemented such as field trips, meetings and other large gatherings such as physical fitness classes or choir classes or catering in the cafeteria, by widening the gap between stalls, determining entry and exit times, reducing non-boundary visitors, and using special treatment areas for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is an outbreak in local communities, in addition to social distancing measures, schools may be allowed to remain closed for longer periods of time.
Law enforcement agencies that may have access to persons suspected of having COVID-19 exposure should follow the same protocols for the use of medical professionals, including the use of a screening device.
If a nearby cough occurs, workers should clean and disinfect their compulsory paint and tools with a household cleaning spray or wiper before using them again, and follow standard guidelines on the installation and disposal of PPE used for the cough and laundry.
OSHA reports some health care and funeral workers are at high risk of being laid off.
High-risk occupations include health care supplies, assistance, laboratory and medical transportation personnel with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients who are susceptible.
The staff are highly vulnerable if they are conducting aerosol-producing tests, or taking samples from suspected or known COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough-starting procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental treatments and tests, or invasive sample collection.
High-risk burials are for people who prepare cadavers for those suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19, who are more likely to be exposed to autopsy.In addition, engineering counts, including those for the identification of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, are also included, as are aerosol sampling procedures.
Specialized negative ventilation may be appropriate in some health care and funeral settings.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come for treatment be isolated in a special toilet, especially if they are not suspected of COVID-19.In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for people with known SARS-CoV-2 infection, suspected persons who work within 6 hours, and those who work in aerosol testing.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filter face masks are used in general, documented respiratory protection program, including adequate testing, training and clinical trials.
Other respiratory systems provide better protection and better worker comfort.WHO does not recommend full masks, as COVID-19 is not transmitted through bodily fluids but is a respiratory system disease.
WHO recommends only the use of surgical masks for investigators.
Tests without aerosols recommend that people who take, breathe, or transport breath samples from COVID-19 patients use surgical masks, glasses, or face masks, gowns, and gloves.
If aerosol-producing tests are to be performed, the surgical mask should be replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
With the global supply of PPE inadequate, WHO recommends that to reduce the need for PPE by telemedicine, body isolation should be used as a transparent mirror, direct care should be limited to people with COVID-19 infections, PPE should be used only where necessary for clean work, and should be continued when caring for patients with the same disease, to prevent the chain of PPE supply and control, and to ensure that people without symptoms do not wear masks.

The main line: [COVID-19] Preparing for the future by lighting the effort
The date/time of the transfer: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC

This month we have found ourselves in a difficult situation.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a clear demonstration of our global solidarity and responsibility towards each other.
We have no example of the kind, but we know that our main response is to create the heart of this organization in the world of compassion, solidarity and community building.
The friendliness and exchange we have seen through e-mail, phone calls and chat among our colleagues confirms that they are amazing people we have had the opportunity to work with.
i am so happy to be able to consider you all as my employees.
Last week, I shared the gratitude of everyone in our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia pages these days, and that this vital online help is a powerful sign that it is available to everyone.
This will make your work successful, keep these sites up or if you can get our partners to pay, or keep our community safe.
The world needs Wikipedia to provide information, more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but how we do it, has a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the need for this mission, we will be making some tangible changes to the structure and operation of the facility starting next week.
The work was not easy.
As Robyn previously mentioned, this c-team met to discuss our process and to plan for the next few months and months.
In this discussion, we considered what we thought was the appropriate response to the situation and what we needed to do to keep the organization going during this time.
we wanted to put off our anxiety and help our mission for a long time.
If you want to call again, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors and contractors:
Our average work expectation is 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We are not on holiday - if you can work overtime, this mission may be useful.
However, the world is hard to feed at this time, and whether it's caring for your loved ones, shopping for groceries, or going to the doctor, your safety is our priority.
We Are Not Watching Your Time
Do not go to work to get sick.
this is understandable, but we are saying it.
Need sick days or PTO - tell your manager and help your team organize their calendar and make plans to ensure that the workplaces are covered.
(If you are COVID-19 positive, let Bryan know about T&amp;C Ops and T&amp;C will help you get help and your situation will get attention from management.)
hourly workers will be paid in full.
We will honor our promises to our contractors and our clockwork staff.
Everyone is paid according to the hours worked under normal conditions.
This includes if you are ill and unable to go to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
many people use work as a way to escape the stress of our world.
our work can be very rewarding, especially in times like these.
Again, this is about taking care of your spouse.
We ask that you consult with your manager, so that we know what to expect and can prepare for it.
Some tasks are classified as critical.
there are some things we need to keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fund-sharing groups (among others) are doing critical work that requires additional assistance.
We are beginning to move forward to meet the goals of this era and shift our focus to support what is most important to our mission.
There is much for all of us to do, we will focus on the projects that are most needed.
It's not bad to slow down now.
We have not been asked to double our trip to Vietnam after the pandemic.
I was not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines.
Accept that things have changed, and work to set new goals and deadlines if necessary.
What happens to the APP?
To enter this new home world and to ensure daily working hours, we are considering adjusting the deadline for our 2020-2021 annual report.
Our goal is to propose a 2019-2020 recall that will allow workers enough time to complete a schedule that allows them to prioritize critical work, taking care of their own, caring for loved ones, and allocating time to those who want to reduce their work schedule over the next few weeks.
This shifting of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and stress of this time period across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and will update it in our next step regarding representatives and groups once we have approval.
We thank the APP Group for your leadership.
The office environment, exposure, and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our SF-Foundation colleagues may have been exposed to COVID-19.
However, in addition to the need for caution, a small number of antiviral cleanup teams are in place to disinfect the San Francisco office space.
They used hospital-grade antiviral spray to disinfect every touch point, including the lobby and the lift backs to the village.
The building is under the control of its own security personnel who provide security support to its workers
We are confident that our office will be properly prepared when we decide to move back.
Our DC office is located on WeWork, and its COVID-19 protocols are shared with us and all DC-founding staff members.
As of last week, our DC office has moved to full-fledged remote planning with guidance from the San Francisco Shire.
Like some of our NYC-based partners, we were discussing the hiring of a location in Brooklyn.
These talks are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
They believe that our long-range instruments are a hindrance, so they would like to offer some advice:
The Bible teaches that we should be "constant in prayer" and "keep on the watch".
If you need to plan ahead, consider how to break it down into specific days.
Make a note of the meetings, and keep a schedule, and send in advance the material to be read.
Default this video, to know the direct link and contacts with Google Docs and Zoom.
You have instructions for holding individual meetings, anyone controls the chat and monitors the speaker list, and anyone takes notes (or co-notes).
If you need a secure headset, email tech support.
Use your safety cards to enter.
Join the #remoties channel to talk to your colleagues about the work being shared on Slack
This HR Operations team is monitoring the growth of webinar-based ergonomics across the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all communities to cancel public events such as Wikimedia-funded editathons until WHO declares the pandemic over.
We understand that this cancellation request or other restrictions on the licensing process we have agreed to make it impossible to obtain their work and we want them to know that no one will be penalized for delaying or improving these patches.
Next week we will be following up on further guidelines for Wikimania and its other regional and thematic community conferences.
The global community is feeling sad and sad, and they feel relieved that they can't work in their own community, Wikimedia or otherwise.
In continuation, CRT is working to create a Meta-Wiki page to provide a place for the community to monitor its efforts and keep track of our interactions with them.
The awareness of COVID-19 related issues
We will send a welcome message to your calendar for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share further updates, answer your questions, and take time to meet in person.
we are in this together and we should help as much as we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to access this information via email, and other important information related to COVID-19 is available on the Office Wiki.
CRT keeps these pages updated and all this information in one place.
We are working to continue our contacts with staff in the countries that are most affected during this period.
For travel, arrangements, a major work trip, or a coverage pledge, or anything else you need help with, please feel free to contact CRT and work with them.
We are here to provide you with help and support as needed.
If you have confidential or embarrassing information, please email Bryan Judan - HR International Global Operations Director.
These changes should not be seen as limiting our work and our rights.
However, it is clear that in this period, our work and our destiny will have to change in a way that is different from the way we have done in the past.
These are the steps we thought would help us to help each other and work together, provide the necessary support for our movement, and help the world with their support.
Our work that has been done will wait until the time comes.
From now on, we will help each other and create the space for the important work that will be done in the coming weeks and months.
We expect you all to work to make this happen, so that you can take care of yourself and your family and be able to find yourself while they are making the necessary purchases.
Now, please - wash your hands and do not touch your face!
The CRT is composed of the following members: Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the remaining management teams (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, Toby N).
b'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme found in the lungs, heart, kidneys, and intestinal mucosa.
ACE2 opposes the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the size of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin 1-7.This makes it a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as a gateway to cells for some coronaviruses.
The human soul compound is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing meta-enzyme found in endothelial and other body tissues.
ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptide M2 domain and the C-terminal collectin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a type I membrane protein that is a major active enzyme in the absorption of lung and other tissues.
The ACE2 domain outside the cell is cut from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called shadase, and the resulting protein is transported to the bloodstream and then removed by the test.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is found in the alveolar cells of lung type II, the endocytes of the liver, the endothelial cells of the arteries and veins, the cells of the arterial mucosa, and the cell membranes of most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The first service of ACE2 is to order ACE.
ACE, the angiotensin I hormone, releases angiotensin II, which is secreted into the bloodstream.
ACE2 in turn hydrolyzes the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), which is H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH.
ACE2 can bind to various peptides such as [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 regulates the inhibitory action of the neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is also associated with heart failure.
As a memory protein, ACEI 2 is the main entry point for HCoV-NL63 and single-coronaviruses including SARS-CoV (SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
In particular, the protein spikes of SARS-CoV S1 and SARS-CoV2 are associated with the ACE2 enzyme domain in the body of the cells, which results in endocytosis and translation of the virus and the enzyme to the endosome in the cell.
This process requires the activation of the carrier series protease TMPRSS2 to primate the S protein. The use of blocking this protease as a therapeutic is being studied.
However, many professionals and regulatory bodies recommend the continuation of the ACE inhibitor to ARB therapy.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, showed that ""the use of ACE inhibitors reduced the risk of developing pneumonia by 34% compared to controls"".
"Researchers have found that ""the risk of developing pneumonia was reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at risk of developing severe pneumonia, especially in those who suffered from stroke and heart failure"."
Although the results have not been confirmed to be positive for pneumonia, the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with deaths from pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is a novel treatment for acute lung injury, and has been shown to improve pulmonary hypodynamics and oxygen saturation in patients with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 is 10 hours, and the duration of the course of effect is 30 minutes, in addition to the 24-hour duration.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising treatment for people who are not receptive to renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) in patients with high angiotensin II.Inplantation of rhACE2 has been proven in clinical trials to treat severe respiratory distress syndrome.
b'COVID-19 applications are used as mobile phone information to respond to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, to monitor the transmission of infection by touch/touch, i.e. to identify people who may have had direct contact with an infected person.
In some states and jurisdictions, with official government assistance, many applications have been approved and removed.
Several initiatives have been launched to develop applications to monitor communications.
The risk of vulnerability, especially based on geographic location monitoring of users
Minimal options for the user to use signals to connect to other Bluetooth mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google announced that it was working with Apple to integrate a Bluetooth-based app directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has launched an app that notifies citizens who have had contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
It is being used in over 200 Chinese cities.In Singapore, the Trace_Tugger app is being used.
"This application was developed by the local IT community and is provided to the government and is open to the public.North Macedonia is a Bluetooth-based application that begins with ""StopKorona!" and is designed to find people who have been in contact with an infected person and provide a prompt response to the health of the professional".
The app was developed by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Communications and Technology.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for approval on the Google Play Store and Apple Store.
On April 12, the government said that the communications monitoring app had been delayed and was about to be released within weeks.Similar apps are being developed in Ireland and France.
Australia and New Zealand are considering using the BlueTrace protocol-based app on Singapore's TraceTogether app.Russia is launching a geofencing app for confirmed COVID-19 patients in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has identified a number of practical problems that can come with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential for decreased effectiveness associated with the use of the application by a small segment of the population.
"To combat the spread of ""coronavirus"" apps that provide misleading or malicious information, Apple has limited the number of organizations that allow coronavirus-related apps to be uploaded to the App Store, allowing only ""governmental"" or trusted organizations".
Google and Amazon have added similar footprints.
The risk of coronavirus is highlighted by the development of a new approach to establishing transmission of disease after coronavirus, especially after the disease has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such surveillance.
Organizations identified eight conditions in government projects:
The monitoring should be legal, relevant and proportionate.
The monitoring and surveillance measures require a post-noise breach report.
The use of data will be limited to COVID-19.
It must ensure that the security and confidentiality of information is maintained and maintained with a focus on the subject.
Digital surveillance should eliminate discrimination and bias.
Any sharing of data with third parties must be legally defined;
There should be protection of the rights of citizens to respond to counter-terrorism and these counter-terrorism measures;
"Significant participation of all stakeholders, including public health experts and private groups, is needed. The German Keio Computer Laboratory (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also released a checklist".
The upcoming Google/Apple deal seeks to resolve ongoing security issues by removing this monitoring and tracking feature from their devices when it is no longer necessary.
Some apps use country-based network location-based methods, which are useful for reducing the chance of downloading and removing tracking.
Network-based surveillance is authorized in Israel.
A web-based solution that can access local data elements is a major vulnerability.
However, all systems with a central server have a local access point, and many systems have a dedicated interface to connect to the central server (see also section below).
In South Korea, an app-based system has been used to track the progress of vaccinations.
The use of a dedicated app with advanced mobile tracking and mapping capabilities, as well as separate sources of tracking information, can help to send text messages to individual patients.
In addition to alerting potential victims, the government has made the location information available to the public, in a move that is intended to change the country's information policy following the MERS pandemic.
This information is shared by various websites and websites. Countries such as Germany are also using a centralized and privacy-friendly system.
No details have been released as of April 6, 2020.
The process of identifying people who have been in contact with patients with a disability is legally established and was initiated in 2013 by the National Research Council.As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen professional groups, including the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), have been able to use a safe solution to track how close a user is to other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a collaborative effort with a centralized and non-centralized approach, not a protocol, including non-centralized protocols such as personalized transmission monitoring (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary access numbers (TCN, FKA access preparation numbers, CEN), personal vulnerability protocols and mobile access monitoring (PACT), and other centralized access.
In these protocols, no sensitive personal data is transferred from the device and all data is intercepted on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing a robust approach to data collection and use of privacy-preserving techniques to measure the spread of COVID-19.
"It was based on a study from the White Paper, "Removed Approaches: Maintaining Privacy During a Pandemic", published in March 2020.Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform, developed by Enigma MPC, a private technology development company at MIT Media Laboratory".
SafeTress users will be able to share their personal addresses and study conditions with other users and staff without any intrusion.
On 5 April 2020, the International TCN Alliance was formed by groups on similar approaches and interoperable protocols, with the goal of reducing latency, working together to create a global monitoring and measurement approach, and a key to widespread dissemination.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that the regular version of the government's application, the Lottery Protocol, had been opened.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which controls the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a communications surveillance initiative based on low-power Bluetooth technology and cryptographic security, which they claim protects privacy.
He also published the details of the cutting edge technologies used in this system.
According to Apple and Google, the system will be rolled out in three phases.
Tools for governments to create a public privacy-focused coronavirus tracking app
The process is a direct link to the OS for Android, Google and Apple, initially by updating the system through the computer operating system, and then by removing the system in the same way after the connection is over, with the aim of identifying any further troubleshooting issues.
b'Drug recycling (also known as drug re-purposing, re-profiling, re-use, or drug recycling) is the practice of reusing a drug that has been approved to treat another disease or health condition.
This is one line of scientific research currently being monitored to develop effective and safe COVID-19 treatments.
Other areas of research include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convergent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 drug-binding proteins, each with multiple ligand receptor sites.
Researching treatment sites provides a realistic plan for developing an effective vaccine against COVID-19 proteins.
The most useful proteins targeted for SARS-CoV-2 are papine-type proteases, RNA complex RNA polymerase, helicases, S proteins and ADP ribosphites.
Hussein, AA et al. have studied several compounds and subsequently developed a suitable anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug with a similarly highly recognized drug, which has been used in preclinical studies to enhance the design and performance of clinical trials.
Chloroquine is a malaria drug and is used for certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine were among the four drugs approved as part of clinical trials.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that the state of New York will begin testing chloroquine for hydroxychloroquine on March 24.On March 28, the FDA approved hydroxychloroquine sulfate for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for chloroquine phosphate.
The treatment has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for clinical trials and is authorized as an experimental emergency treatment for patients who are hospitalized in clinical trials but cannot receive treatment.
The CDC says it has not yet established whether hydroxychloroquine is effective as a preventative or a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Doctors say they will use the drug when there is no other option.
A small study in Istanbul, Turkey, by a research team is investigating the use of chlorokine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
He is also a senior research fellow at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting safety and efficacy testing for the use of hydroxychloroquine in immunotherapy.
"Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Xinjiang have shown favipiravir to be ""clearly effective"".
In Shenzhen, 35 people were declared free of the virus within 4 days, and 45 people who were not vaccinated were diagnosed with the disease for 11 days.
A study was conducted in water on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of whom were given favipiravir and half of whom were given umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical company reminds the public that the current evidence supporting the drug is preliminary and insufficient.
On March 2, Germany announced that it would buy the vaccine from Japan and use the military to distribute it to university hospitals treating COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Post, Shinzo Abe has provided supplies to the Trump administration for the purchase of the vaccine, which may not be effective in severe cases because the virus is so spread.
Women who are planning to conceive via IVF may not be safe to take advantage of it.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (CALTRA) concluded that the combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir was beneficial.
These drugs prevent the spread of HIV through the use of prosthetics.
A research team at the University of Colorado is trying to improve drugs to create compounds that are linked to the SARS-CoV-2 prototype.The scientific community is criticizing the use of resources to develop drugs for HIV/AIDS alone.
WHO includes lopinavir/ritonavir in the global strength trial.
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences to prevent Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection.Gilead Sciences has found that Remdesivir has antiviral activity against several phyllo-, nymo-, maramix-, and coronaviruses.
One problem with these antiviral drugs is their resistance to mutations, which can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some preliminary clinical studies have suggested that remdesivir has a high genetic limit to tolerance.Several clinical trials are underway, including two at Cleveland University Hospitals; one in people with moderate disease and one in people with severe disease.
There are currently three clinical trials confirming the use of blood-based vitamin C for patients who have been admitted to treatment for severe illness due to COVID-19. Of these, two are placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one is non-controlled (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, the state of New York began testing an antibiotic called azithromycin.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) announced that it will begin a clinical trial to investigate whether Teijin's Alvesco (ciclesonide), an anti-inflammatory inhaled corticosteroid, is effective as a treatment for patients who have not yet developed symptoms of the novel coronavirus.
200 patients with clinical critical illness from Denmark, Germany and Austria will be tested for the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme phase II.
The Montreal Heart Institute in Canada is studying the role of colchicine in reducing pulmonary complications and irritation in people with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The trial, called COLCORONA, began with 6,000 patients over the age of 40 who had been infected with COVID-19 and showed symptoms that did not require treatment.
Pregnant or breastfeeding mothers or those without effective contraceptive methods are not eligible.
Several anti-corrosion agents are being tested in Italy.
Heparin, a lightweight molecular formula, is used by many patients to treat the disease. The Italian Medical Agency helped to publish this guideline.
A public health study of 300 patients was announced in Italy on April 14 to study the efficacy of inoxaparin and sodium as both a preventive and curative agent.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much attention has been focused on re-targeting antiviral drugs that were approved before the outbreak of MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus pandemic.
Ribavirin: China's 7th edition of guidelines recommends that ribavirin be used as a COVID-19 drug.
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 based on the Chinese 7th edition
Some antibiotics may be offered as a treatment for COVID-19
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): has been approved in China.
See also trials in Italy and China of Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a theoretical vaccine that is designed to prevent the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
While there is no approved vaccine for clinical trials, several trials are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect to develop a vaccine against the virus that causes the disease, SARS-CoV-2, within 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety screening.
COVID-19 was first identified in September 2019.
The pandemic spread around the world in 2020, prompting a massive investment and research effort to develop vaccines.
Several companies are working to develop vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 using the genetically engineered genes.
In April, CEPI announced vaccine development milestones, speed, production capacity, mass availability, and global supply.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19 by early 2020.
Major stages to the Phase I safety study include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (class I development and vaccine infant, Moderna, mRNA-1273))
viral vector (phase I vaccine and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
CEPI Scientists reported in April, 115 generic vaccine options are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public data (thought to be or planned).
Phase I-II trials are primarily safety, immunogenicity, placebo-controlled, randomized, and multi-site trials that determine the accuracy and efficacy of a drug dose.
Phase III trials involve a large number of participants and a control group, as well as trials to monitor the efficacy of vaccines to prevent disease and to monitor adverse drug reactions at the recommended dose.
Practical development in 79 vaccine candidates started in April 2020 Initially 74 were not in human childhood evaluation (still under investigation)
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that a vaccine is being developed that could stimulate the immune system by modifying the molecular clamp of the virus protein.
On September 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada announced that it had begun work on a vaccine for testing in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced on January 26, 2020 at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention at Hong Kong University on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceuticals announced that it had begun work on developing a vaccine under the leadership of Hank Schwitmaker.
Janssen is collaborating with its biotechnology company Vaxart to develop oral vaccines.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent Bio-Solutions announced that it was partnering with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen Laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine technology similar to the neoantigen vaccine for cancer treatment.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that the development of the vaccine had been completed and trials were underway.
On February 27, 2020, Generex subsidiary NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology announced that it was launching a vaccine project to develop a Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They plan to develop a vaccine embryo that can be tested on humans within 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, Washington University St. Louis announced a project to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Health Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick announced that vaccines were being developed for the Walter Reed Army Research Facility in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland.
On or about March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into a joint venture with Novavax Inc.

Using bacteriophages, the DNA is able to grow harmless viral analogues within the bacteria inside the host, producing foreign antibodies to the immune system, unlike SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to use IBM supercomputers, in collaboration with cloud computing services from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects.
This means that they may benefit more than they prevent.
Australia seeks additional testing with 4,170 health care professionals
Vaccines in development may be safe or not effective.
Studies in model animals specific to COVID-19 to evaluate vaccine efficacy highlight the importance of the International Coalition to Assess Level 3 Biosafety Measures and the most stringent safety standards for controlling ACE2-transferred viruses, other laboratory animals, and non-human pathogens.
In-house models of human-animal disease with SARS and MERS vaccines
There is no safe and effective vaccine or vaccine against SARS in 2020.
According to papers published in 2005 and 2006, the development of a new vaccine or drug for SARS is a priority for governments and public health authorities.
At the height of the MERS outbreak, it was believed that the current SARS vaccine research could be a useful model for the development of a vaccine and a model for the MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, one class I human clinical trial is approved, and three others are in the pipeline, all of which are viral-vectored, two of which are adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one is MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S) (DNA-based) MERS vaccine.
Social media posts have theorized that the COVID-19 virus was known and that a vaccine exists.
Patents on social media are patents on genetic sequences and vaccines of other coronavirus strains such as SARS.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Similar symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include weakness, sore cheeks, dizziness, sore throat, difficulty lifting and stomach pain.
The time from the onset of symptoms to the onset of symptoms is usually five days, but can vary between two and fourteen days.
Although most cases show mild symptoms, some can lead to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered from the disease. The virus is mainly transmitted to people who have close contact, mostly through small bowel movements such as coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
Although these patches are formed by breathing in, they travel long distances and fall to the ground or other places rather than being swallowed by humans.
people can get infected by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive in wet environments for up to 72 hours.
The first three days of onset of symptoms are the most common, although transmission may occur later in the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is by means of true reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect and conceal the virus.
The general public's advice on mask use varies, with some authorities saying it should not be used, others recommending it, and others seeking its benefits.
At this time, there is no clear vaccine or antiviral for COVID-19.
Local spread of the disease has been reported across all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may not show symptoms or may develop symptoms that are more like a cold, such as fever, cough, weakness, and shortness of breath.
Symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain, dizziness, difficulty moving, facial or lip swelling; these symptoms require immediate medical attention if they occur.
Less common, upper respiratory symptoms may include wheezing, chest pain, or sore throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as fever, vomiting and constipation were observed at various doses.
One Chinese case had only initial symptoms of pulmonary heart pressure and palpation.
In some people, the disease can cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
this is called the famine period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is five to six days but can take two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms show symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.
The transmission pathway of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
The majority of asymptomatic cases are being identified and monitored at this time, with the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of confirmed cases are asymptomatic in hospital settings.
China's National Health Commission began counting asymptomatic cases on April 1, with 130 (78%) of the 166 cases reported that day as asymptomatic.
Ticks and ticks carry high levels of the virus.
Shouting out can cause more damage than normal speech.
A study in Singapore shows that a non-covered mouth can make a mosquito's tail travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Since the virus is not entirely airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that there may be bioresonance transmission, and air collectors have shown positive RNA results in samples from people in other populations.
Some treatments, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may involve aerolyzed respiratory fluids, which may result in airway infection.
Although there is a risk of transmission through the mouth, the chance of transmission is believed to be low.The virus is most likely to spread if people show symptoms; however, transmission can occur before symptoms develop, but the chance is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said it was not clear where the disease was easily transmitted, but one person could have been two or three people.
In particular, the virus can survive in the armadio for one day, in polypropylene for three days in stainless steel (AISI 304) and in 99% copper for four hours.
However, this may vary depending on the temperature and humidity.
Soap and detergents are suitable if used properly; soap products weaken and disable the protective mask, and cleanse the skin and other areas.
Other solvents, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, a sample of the tissue was taken two days after the patient was admitted to the hospital.
Of the six patients, five showed the highest viral concentration in the first sample, and the sixth showed the highest viral concentration in the second test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in Wuhan City in three cases of severe respiratory illness and pneumonia.
All the variants of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are inherently similar to the coronavirus.
Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which is useful as a deterrent.SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the primary SARS-CoV.
The nerves are the most vulnerable organs to COVID-19 because the virus enters the human cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found in large numbers in the nervous system type II alivion cells.
"The virus binds to ACE2 using a special glycoprotein ""spike"" (peplomer) and enters the human cell".
Severe heart failure was found in 12% of infected patients hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is less common in severely ill patients.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high, which is also responsible for the systemic inflammatory response and immune system problems in this disease, but new myocardial damage with cardiac ACE2 receptors may be the cause.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and are associated with cardiac function.
High risk of blood clots (31%) and venous blood clots (25%) in ICU COVID-19 patients were found to be associated with a poor prognosis.
SARS-COV-2 has a tropism that expresses ACE2 in the epithelial cells of the respiratory system, and people with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells have been found to interact with inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes in people with severe lung pathology who have COVID-19 infection.
Lymphocytic infiltrate has been detected in NIRSA testing.
WHO has published several diagnostic protocols for the disease.
The standard methods of diagnosis are true reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is performed on respiratory samples with a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or a colonoscopy may also be used.
Results are generally available within a few to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results are valid.
Chinese scientists have isolated and published the genetic sequence of the coronavirus strain and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests worldwide have successfully detected the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (which can block active infections and detect previous infections) was in development, but not widely used.
Chinese testing experience has shown 60 to 70% accuracy.
The US FDA approved the first test point for use on 21 March 2020 at the end of the month.The test guidelines suggested that Wuhan University Zongnan Hospital detect infections with clinical properties and epidemiological risks.
Peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior transmission of dual multicellular grass-like infections are common in early infections.
Subplural hyperplasia, distorted secretions (lobular septal swelling with alveolar filling), and constipation may also occur as the disease progresses.
There is some data on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological connections of autopsy:
Microscopy, pulmonary, pericardial, and pulmonary coagulation
There are four types of viral pneumonia that can be diagnosed:
mild pneumonia, including pulmonary edema, pneumocytal hyperplasia, active atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic inflation and multi-nucleated large cells
Severe pneumonia, diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with dizzy alveolar exudate.
DAD is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Treating pneumonia: collecting fluid from the alveolar and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: distributed intravascular coagulation (DIC); lycoerythroplastic response
Preventing the risk of infection by staying home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, breathing properly and keeping clean, and avoiding coughing, sneezing, or coughing.
The CDC recommends using a mouthguard when you are breathing or breathing and a hand wrap if you are not.
Proper hand washing is recommended after bathing or washing.
CDC recommends the use of face masks in crowded areas, to reduce the ability to transmit from people who do not show symptoms.Social distancing measures have been implemented to prevent people infected from contacting large numbers of people by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and closing public places.
Instructions for maintaining distance from people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m).
"There is no effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19 and vaccines are not expected to be available until 2021; the key method of controlling COVID-19 is to lower the epidemic's peak, which is called "flattening the curve".
The CDC recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or eating with visible hand dirt, before eating or after coughing, sneezing, or coughing.
In the absence of commercial hand sanitizers, WHO recommends two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, these antimicrobial activities are derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
It helps in killing bacteria with alcohol hydrogen and peroxide; hand antiseptics are not active ingredients
Glycerol is included as a humicant.
People are being treated with supportive care, including fluid therapy, oxygen and other support for injured major organs.
The CDC says people who suspect they have the virus should wear masks.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being tested.
Personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to boost immunity.
The WHO has published guidelines for the National Health Commission of China and for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
Medical researchers in the US provide free information and advice to IBCC from a variety of sources.
As of April 2020, there is no vaccine for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals prefer paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen as the first use.
Precautions have been taken to reduce the potential for transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings where procedures such as inhibition or hand ventilation are in place to prevent the spread of aerosols.
Health professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that patients be placed in an airborne infection isolation unit (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, care and airborne precautions.
The recommended gear is PPE gown, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If close, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use but the FDA will allow these masks for use in emergency use authorization (EUA).
These are not guaranteed to use the qualification of certain biological agents used for protection against airborne substances such as abora.
When you do not have a mask, CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other treatment, although a certain percentage of these cases are.
Respiratory assistance for people in hospital who are experiencing respiratory failure with COVID-19 is actively maintained, and high-flow oral cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure can be removed to eliminate intubation.
Whether these two lead to the same benefit in critically ill people is still unknown.
A doctor may choose to use invasive mechanical ventilation if they are nearby because this method reduces the release of aerosol substances compared to a high-density cannula.
Many developing countries lack adequate hospital beds per patient, which reduces the capacity of the health system to care for severe cases of COVID-19.
In China alone, 5% of the studies were admitted to the intensive care unit, 2.3% required mechanical respiratory assistance, and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 have been admitted to ICU after a slow recovery.
Ventilation mechanisms are complicated and oxygenation is very difficult in the development of COVID-19 Emergency Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
Ventilators with pressure control and high PEEP increase oxygen uptake and reduce ventilator-related lung and pneumothoracic damage.
High PEEP may not be present in the old ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir has been found to be more promising.
Development of any new drugs may be delayed until 2021, but most of the drugs being tested have been approved for other uses or are in the high-level testing phase.
Antiviral therapy may be tested in individuals who have been diagnosed with a serious illness.
WHO has asked volunteers to participate in this trial to verify the efficacy and safety of certain drugs.The FDA has granted provisional approval for Convalescent Plasma as an experimental drug, which poses a serious and persistent risk to the life of the person being tested.
He has not made any clinical trials to show that his condition is safe and effective.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to control the pandemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can use surveillance data to 'trace' and thus detect the possibility of infection.
One user can see the status of three other users.
If a risk arises, this app not only advises isolation, but also alerts local health authorities.Big data analytics can be used to identify infected people and identify potential contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore using mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone detection and artificial intelligence.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people with coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and to protect infected citizens from contacts.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared general telephone location data with the German Federal Agency, Robert Koch Institute, to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has developed facial recognition technology to track the release of serum quarantine patients.
"Italy's regional health commissioner Julio Galera said mobile phone operators had been informed that ""40% of people were still moving"."
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
Estonia's President Kersti Kaljulaid calls for a global creative solution to coronavirus.
Individuals in quarantine, travel restrictions, and the side effects of the infection can cause anxiety in themselves.
"According to BBC's Rory O'Connor, ""Social isolation, privacy, health concerns, stress and economic decline are all factors that are increasingly detrimental to people's mental health and well-being""".
The disease may be mild with certain symptoms or may not show any symptoms, as with other common upper respiratory diseases such as cough.
Mild cases heal within two weeks, while severe or life-threatening cases take three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women are at high risk of COVID-19 infection, data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but COVID-19 is not.
In severe cases, COVID-19 can lead to rapid and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Severe COVID-19-related effects include sepsis, irregular blood clots, and heart, kidney, and liver damage.
Blood clotting disorders, especially elevated prothrombin, were observed in 6% of COVID-19 hospitalizations, and abnormal renal function was observed in 4% of these groups.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 show high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to some reports, the difference between the day of onset of symptoms and death is ten days, five days in the hospital.
However, the median time between patients transferred to ICU and recovery in hospital is also the time between death and recovery.
In early studies, the time between onset of symptoms and death is 14 days, but it can range from six to 41 days.
According to the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8% and for women 1.7%.
Histopathological examination samples of the deceased lung showed diffuse alveolar damage and fibromyxoid excretes in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic mutations in the lymphocytes are seen.
This pulmonary imaging is similar to emergency respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese Health Commission, cardiac damage was due to troponin infusion or cardiac arrest.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of people receiving sleep treatment had previously had other health conditions.
Estimates of the mortality rate in this situation vary due to regional differences, as well as methodological differences.
Inadequate measurement of mild cases can lead to a higher death rate.
However, the current death toll is not fully understood, as the deaths are of chronic disease.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe COVID-19 symptoms and are about 2.4 times more likely to die than those who do not smoke.
Hong Kong hospital authorities found a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in recovering patients, and lung scans showed organ damage.
This was followed by a seizure leading to post-acute surveillance syndrome.
As of March 2020, it is not known whether previous infections can produce active, long-term immunity.
The lack of infection is due to the nature of other coronaviruses, but cases of COVID-19 that have been confirmed to be positive have been reported.
These cases are believed to be a result of a persistent infection, not a re-infection.
The virus is intermediate and is thought to have animal origin, and is transmitted through a vector.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the virus has been almost completely transmitted from person to person.
The first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, showed a start date of symptoms as of 1 December 2019.
A public release from WHO reports the first onset of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
There are many methods to calculate the death rate.
These figures vary by region and over time are influenced by the number of tests, health care system records, treatment recommendations, the proportion of the population from the time of the first outbreak, and characteristics such as age, gender, and general health.
In late 2019, WHO reported that the acute ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 were for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for people who died clinically or epidemiologically from COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Johns Hopkins University statistics show that the global case fatality rate is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who die from the disease, the infectious mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people who are infected and die from the disease (tested and undetected).
These statistics are not limited to the population with the best case.
Since not all infected people develop disease, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been collected.
In Italy, the first epicenter of the epidemic, 80 (1.7%) of the 4,600 inhabitants died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread during the carnival festival, and was able to spread to young people, resulting in fewer deaths, and not all COVID-19 deaths should be classified as such.
In addition, the German health system is not overcrowded.
In the Netherlands, there may be as few as 3% of antibodies derived from donor blood.
69 people (0.004% of the population) reportedly died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the death rate are different for men and women.
The mortality rate is higher among men in studies in China and Italy.
The risk of men in their 50s being exposed, the difference between women and men is only 90%.
In China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The exact cause of this gender difference is unknown, but it may be due to racial and behavioral factors.
Sex-based immunological differences, low prevalence of infectious diseases in women and higher prevalence of infectious diseases in men, such as high blood pressure, may have contributed to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals are men and 72% of COVID-19 deaths are men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not track data on gender-related COVID-19 infections.
Studies of viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have affected men and women in different ways.
A high percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have a high risk of contracting the virus.
"The WHO announced the official name of the disease on January 11, 2020 as "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Alvahanom said CO represents corona, VI represents virus, and D represents disease, and 19 represents the year the pandemic was first identified: December 31, 2019.
The designation was given to avoid identifying a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, and would have been aimed at preventing discrimination if they were to be excluded from the international recommendations.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Emergency Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"WHO also uses the terms ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""virus that causes COVID-19"" in public discourse".
"The disease and the virus are called the "coronavirus".
"During the early period of the Wuhan pandemic, China, the disease and the virus were collectively referred to as the ""coronavirus"" and the ""Wuhan coronavirus"".
In January 2020, WHO recommended that 2019-nCov be used as a diagnostic site for severe respiratory disease of the 2019-nCoV virus and the disease causing pathogen, in accordance with the 2015 guidelines.
The official designations for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on 11 February 2020.
By reducing the capacity of the standard chain, some digital detectors are producing healthcare materials such as chest swabs and ventilator organs.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed ventilator valves, and the facility failed to deliver within the stated time limit, a local startup engineer built 100 valves in one night.
"After the first COVID-19 pandemic, conspiracy theories, misinformation and false information about its origin, extent, prevention pathway, cure and other disease organs have spread rapidly online".
Humans can transmit the virus to animals.
The study could not find evidence for the spread of the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is no approved drug or vaccine to treat this disease.
A global study of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
"In March, the World Health Organization began the 'SOLIDARITY Trial' of these four antiviral compounds with high expectations".
No vaccine is needed, however, as various agencies are offering vaccination options.
Preliminary studies on SARS-CoV have been increased because SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptors to activate human cells.
Three vaccines are being studied.
First, they are studying the virus to try to develop a full vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or deadly, is intended to develop the human body's immunity to the new COVID-19 virus.
The second method, part of the unit vaccines, is aimed at making the subunit of the virus immune to the human body.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies focused on the S-spike protein, which helps the virus enter the ACE2 receptor enzyme.
The third method is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new vaccine creation technique).
Within these methods, experimental vaccines must pass safety and validity tests.The first vaccine was launched by four volunteers in Seattle on March 16, 2020, under European supervision.
The vaccine has a harmless genetic code that mimics the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-supported improvement is recommended in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this is also controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials were testing approved drugs for the treatment of malaria, including studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The re-engineered antiviral drug contains most of the Chinese research, along with nine Phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries, according to a report released in late April.
The development of COVID-19 vaccines and selected drugs underwent a major review, beginning in April 2020.Various existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for COVID-19 testing, including remdesivir, chloroquine for hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon beta.
There is limited data on the efficacy of remdesivir, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvements were seen in patients tested with a mild form of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, a drug used to treat tuberculosis, was studied in China in February 2020, and preliminary results have been shown.
However, a review of the study is needed.
Korean and Chinese health officials recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Institute of Water Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but says that taking two doses is extremely dangerous and can kill.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA approved hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for emergency use by doctors treating COVID-19. This 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Initial evidence suggests that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for in vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide has been tested in a continuous biological trial for low SARS-CoV-2 virulence.Studies of the first spike protein associated with transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) have determined that SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquine versus hydroxychloroquine with and without azithromycin have raised significant concerns that the medical community cannot use it without further investigation.Oseltamivir is not classified in vitro for SARS-CoV-2 and has no COVID-19 treatment.
Cytokine storm is a side effect of the late-season COVID-19 pandemic.
Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to have anti-cytocin storming properties.Tocilizumab was included in the national clinical guidelines after a small study in China.
A non-random phase 2 trial is underway nationwide in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
To test for the presence of Sturm along with serum ferritin and blood tests for cytokines, such developments are thought to be the cause of death in some individuals.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA for the treatment of various causes of steroidal refractory cytokine-induced syndromes based on a retrospective case, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, no randomized, controlled data has shown tocilizumab to be effective for CRS.
Resistant and advanced antibodies are not recommended for people who have been immunocompromised by people who have recovered from COVID-19, but they are being tested to exploit the innate immune system.
This method was tested for SARS and gave unsatisfactory results.
Passive antibody therapy for viral neutralization is expected to be used to prevent SARS-CoV-2.
However, other methods, such as antibody-based cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may also occur.
Other advanced antibody treatments, such as the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
Convulsive serum, which contains the blood plasma of recovered patients and contains antibodies to the virus, may be useful for rapid efficacy.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, died trying to raise awareness about COVID-19 before he contracted the virus.
