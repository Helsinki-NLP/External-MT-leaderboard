The number of people infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19) reflects the similar behaviour between the EU/EU and UK trading partners which proves that, although the COVID-19 pandemic is at different stages in different countries, it is expanding at a stronger rate globally.

Trestauration studies show that about 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild infection, i.e., a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most of these people recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 becomes a serious illness requiring hospitalization and in 6% of cases, it becomes a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The number of COVID-19 vaccinated patients who died was about 4%.

As a method to calculate the number of COVID-19 patients undergoing treatment, we counted the total number of COVID-19 cases reported over 14 days, in each EU/EEA country and UK, during the period 1 January15 March 2020.
We also showed the number of confirmed cases in each country as it increased on 15th August 2020 at 2:00am compared to the same period in Italy on 31st January15th March.
COVID-19 behaviour in EU/EEA and UK countries
The movement of COVID-19 cases reported in 14 days in EU/EEA countries and UK generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).

This was due to the rapid increase in cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK had a rise in COVID-19 cases similar to (Current).
Figura 2 show the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK compared to Italy during the period 31 January15 March 2020.
It shows that, as of 15 March at 2:00 am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and UK had the same total cases as Italy in just 3 weeks ago or less.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The situation in the number of people infected with COVID-19 indicates that the problem is increasing at the same rate in all countries.
This remains the case even though countries have different levels of treatment, different criteria for determining whether a person is infected and different criteria for determining who is tested for COVID-19, including increasing the number of people tested.
Early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation as 10% of COVID-19 patients were in need of intensive care and news reported that hospitals and intensive care rooms in these areas were overcrowded.
The prevalence of COVID-19 patients in hospital beds and/or ICU rooms is only 6% and 1% respectively at EU/EEA levels (these data are not included).

The 201011 survey showed a significant difference in the number of intensive care beds and intensive care beds in Europe, with Germany having 29.2 beds and Portugal 4.2 beds per 100,000 population.

The potential for healthcare overcrowding, based on comparative COVID-19 hospitalization in each EU/EEA country and UK and the risk of hospital demand exceeding 90% for acute care, is reported in the sixth ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment report on COVID-19.
Due to the fact that cases are still present in some parts of the EU/EEA and UK, and that hospitals and intensive care units serve people in specific areas, patient and intensive care unit information should be available in the form of Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2).

As indicated in the ECDC's review of emergency crises, effective early preparedness is critical to halting the spread of SARS-COV-2, even in the transition from containment to cure, as the rapid increase in the expected number of cases to potential cannot allow the authorities and hospitals to have enough time to understand, accept and implement the necessary measures if they are not implemented early.

There is little agreement on whether countries have the capacity to increase their efforts in curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to reduce the pressure placed on healthcare.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed over 3,000 people and more than 80,000 new cases in China and elsewhere in the world, creating a social disaster.

We will discuss the basics of disease, its cause, its viruses, its diagnosis, its treatment, its prediction, and its avoidance.

The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 became an unforgettable event for Chinese who were asked to stay at home for the entire holiday and the following weeks due to the outbreak of the disease caused by the unknown novel virus.
The virus is identical to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the disease it causes is also named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).

SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but over 30-65 years old. SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but over 30-65 years old.
Almost half (47.7%) of the patients were over 50 years old, a small number were under 20, with only 14 patients being under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 was more prevalent in males (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is more prevalent in the population than in Hubei and surrounding areas.
COVID-19 lasted about 5 (2-9) days from the time it was spread to the time it was detected.
The duration of the symptoms was about 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The time from the time of her discovery to her death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), with a modified R0 value of 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases surged before 23 January 2020, due to the huge number of travellers who travelled before the Chinese Spring Festival.
The patient mortality rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), whereas the modified patient mortality rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three most serious COVID-19 cases were sex (men), age (≥60), and severe diarrhea.
CoVs belong to the genus of large, spherically-spherical viruses with single-stranded RNA.

S-glycoprotein binds to the proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in which the two fatty acids are fused.
RNA is sent to the cell; after the replication of the RNA is done, the RNA is a mixture of glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins that create a viral antibody, which then joins the bloodstream to produce the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 strain was released on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new beta-CoV variant with a genetic similarity of 99.98% in 10 samples tested and these were removed from the original site of the virus, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV in genetics than MERS-CoV.

ACE2 enzymes have been identified to bind SARS-CoV-2 together with SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2's S protein binds to ACE2 enzymes but does not bind as strongly as SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 poses less of a risk to humans than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is also able to produce a shorter protein called orf3b and a derived protein called orf8.
orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for human infection and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no active ingredient.

They found that this compound, which contained two atoms, was arranged as a single atom molecule and that the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind to S proteins, suggesting evidence for detection of CoV and infection.
B0AT1 is likely to be targeted for treatment for testing of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.

1% difference between two genes is still large; therefore, definitive evidence has not yet been obtained (Fig. (Fig. 33).
The full details of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses can survive in a glass for 48 hours on dry and up to 5 days in a glass at a temperature of 20 °C and 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have some specific conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be resistant to ultraviolet radiation at temperatures of 56 °C for 30 minutes; at a 75% tolerance, chlorine, peracetic acid, potassium, and other red compounds, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in killing the virus.

T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play a vital role in the fight against the virus.
CD4+ T cells activate B cells to form antibodies, whereas CD8+ T cells directly kill the targeted antibodies.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help in the immune system.
CoVs, on the other hand, can inhibit T cell function causing T cell death.
Immunity, including proteins such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also important in the fight against the virus.
For example, antibodies removed from a recovered patient disabled MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, overexertion causes the release of free radicals which cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, sometimes causing multiple organ failure and sometimes death.
SARS-CoV-2, which was detected in the early human population, appears to be more prevalent in older adults with other conditions and in pregnant women.
It is common for people with a variety of infections or with a small amount of infection to be more prone to illness than others.
SARS-CoV-2 virus typically takes 1-14 days to show symptoms, with a maximum of 3-7 days based on a study of 425 initial cases in Wuhan.
Rather, a study of 1,099 patients showed that the virus takes an average of 3 days to show symptoms and an average of 0-24 days.
The latest study, mentioned above, shows that it lasts 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) in 8,866 patients.
It is important for health professionals to set quarantine dates based on the exact time the virus has shown symptoms, so as to avoid infecting people who have the virus but do not have symptoms.
As a rule, people who live in a contaminated area or who have the virus need to quarantine for 14 days.
Do people need to be quarantined for 24 days?

Similar findings were reported in two studies of patients with same-sex and patients who had a non-symptomatic implant.
In comparison, a 2012 human study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had malaria (98%), dry throat (47%), and difficulty breathing (55%) as their main symptoms.
80% of those who needed respiratory aids, especially COVID-19 patients and this is consistent with the fact that MERS was more dangerous than COVID-19.

In comparison, the deaths from SARS in November 2002 were 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
According to a demographic survey conducted in June 2012, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
The R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 while the confidence interval (CI) was 95% at 5.71-7.23, whereas the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of their symptoms, their specificity and R0 is shown in Table Table1.1.
The figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less dangerous than the other two.

It has been known that cytokine storm is caused by an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a reactive response involving the release of various cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause the immune system to produce more molecules which are the primary cause of ARDS and various organ failure.
Therapy is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients who are severely ill.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, which are anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other cytokine storm treatments that reduce inflammation include activation of T cell-directed immune response; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, which are used to reduce inflammation, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce erectile dysfunction.

Baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have also been proposed as potential drugs for the treatment of patients with severe respiratory distress.
Spasm, diarrhea, diarrhea, liver damage, and other serious complications may occur when lopinavir/ritonavir is combined with other medicines.
The interaction of this drug with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
antibody plasma from recovered patients
The use of blood transfusions to treat patients with infectious diseases or to prevent infectious diseases has been in use for some time.
Actually, people who have recovered from illness often have more antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are antibodies produced by B lymphocytes to fight against viruses and other foreign substances and to block various molecules in the virus and directly destroy them.

For example, antibodies can cause the cell to multiply and cause cytokine release syndrome, resulting in a more toxic reaction.
The antibodies in blood are usually few, and the plasma is much needed to treat the most serious cases.
It is difficult to develop and produce antibodies quickly enough to fight the global pandemic.
Then it is possible to isolate B cells from recovered individuals and identify the genetic codes of the antibody or test and find the antibody proteins of the main virus.
In this way, we can increase the amount of antibody produced.

They found that the time it took for body temperature to return, symptoms to disappear, and bed rest were much shorter in the influenza+TCM group than in the influenza alone group.
Significantly, symptomatic relapse (from mild to severe) was lower in the treatment-only+TCM group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the treatment-only+TCM group (8.8% versus 39%).

It would also be interesting to explain what is being done and to shed light on the TCM treatments or who is doing them if possible.
Pasientes sospechosos o confirmados de COVID-19 suelen tener un mayor temor a esta enfermedad peligrosa, ylos en cuarentena también pueden experimentar con soledad, aislamiento, y/o enojo.
Additionally, symptoms such as malaria, shortness of breath, and vomitingalong with severe medication-related problems such as corticosteroid-induced insomniacan increase anxiety and headache.

Care in situ should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected COVID-19 patients, and/or their immediate family members and/or all other persons who need it.
Psychosocial support should include the establishment of teams of doctors in various topics, timely and comprehensive information about SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and the use of smart devices to avoid close contact.
Vaccine is useful in preventing the transmission of infections from infected animals and humans to potentially viable vectors and often works in conjunction with antibiotics in the fight against infections caused by the new virus.

A vaccine made from the virus itself has been tested in animals for SARS.

Thus, there are some people who are more susceptible to MERS in the Middle East and it is spread to other areas by the animals that live in those areas.
The MERS vaccine was developed using defective virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral antibodies and recombinant protein subunits and was tested in animals.
The development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in low-risk populations is urgently needed to combat the current pandemic.

As a new disease, the behaviour of COVID-19 has recently been shown in thousands of patients.
Sibly, patients can recover gradually without any symptoms.

Risk: Age is a key factor in predicting the risk of SARS patients, and this is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was most prevalent in the 30-65 age group with 47.7% of cases occurring over 50 years in the 8,866 population study as mentioned above.
Patients requiring more intensive care had more pre-existing conditions and were significantly older than those without (at 66 versus 51 years), meaning that age is an important factor in predicting the risk of COVID-19 patients.
Genre: SARS-CoV-2 has affected more males than females (0.31/100,000 vs 0.27/100,000), as noted above.
Sicknesses and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are at higher risk of acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Heart failure was also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.

Relative test results: The C-reactive protein (CRP) level in blood indicates the irritation of the structure or tissue and has been identified as a potential complication for patients, which occurs during drug action, and a potential cure.
The link between CRP levels and anxiety and the potential for complications in COVID-19 patients has also been discussed.

These enzymes are expressed in large quantities in various tissues, especially in the heart and liver, and are released when a particular reaction occurs.
Spanish for "heart" means "heart".
Symptoms: Imaging of the chest and monitoring of symptoms for a period of time should be done together with other factors to estimate the risk of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are binding to the spleen and are widely used to aid in the treatment of erectile dysfunction to reduce the irritation of erectile injuries.
Due to the high dosage of corticosteroids being used in severe SARS patients, many surviving patients developed a vascular osteonecrosis and remained disabled for a long time and poor quality of life.

The best estimate is that the crisis will end on Wednesday and that the slowdown will last for 3-4 months.

Paul Hunter, and colleagues predicted that COVID-19, which appears to be more prevalent than SARS, will not disappear by 2020.
Ira Longini, and colleagues, found a way to predict the outcome of the pandemic and estimated that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two-thirds of the world's population.
Specialists from Canada have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in recovered patients who were discharged from hospital 2 weeks ago, suggesting that the newly discovered virus may be a recurrent pandemic.

Ebola was originally estimated to infect up to a million people and kill 50,000.

It is possible, as in the case of SARS-CoV, that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be weakened in its infectious mode and subsequently become extinct or weakened in its normal human environment.
A comparison of COVID-19 infection with SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure (Figure.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily through saliva or saliva, and possibly through contact with infected objects.
The virus was also found in the feces, which suggests that it may also be possible to infect the virus if a person eats the wrong food.
A recent study of 138 patients revealed that 41% of the virus patients were discharged from the hospital, including 17 patients diagnosed with other diseases and 40 doctors.

N95 (series # 1860s) masks are the only ones that can block the 10 to 80 nm range, with only 5% of the virus being able to pass through; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and overall is 85 nm.
As the virus can pass through the masks used for the surgery when they are mixed together, the medical personnel must wear N95 masks (series # 1860s) and not the traditional masks.

Bacteria can also pass through the skin.

Doctors should also wear a mask or glasses when working with patients.

China's disease control departments may use this lesson to make future improvements.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful with what they mean to the public because every word means something to the citizens and can change their perception and decision making; (2) be more attentive and respond to unusual information from hospitals rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more aggressive in fighting potentially deadly diseases when they emerge instead of trying to calm the population; and (4) be more active by increasing awareness of the epidemic and testing people and improving the way communities deal with all issues in a timely manner.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus started at the end of December 2019.

️Given the similarity of the virus to SARS-CoV and the similarity of the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to speculation that SARS has returned.

COVID-19 is more prevalent in older adults than in younger adults and in men than in women, and the incidence of morbidity and mortality is higher in older adults than in younger adults.
SARS was more lethal than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients are immune to the virus even when they have no symptoms and SARS patients are immune to the virus when they are severely ill, making it much more difficult to fight the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.

The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed the landscape and highlighted the potential for HCoV to be both dangerous and deadly.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 has re-infected the CoVs in the toilet and has surprised us with the high rate and low frequency of infection compared to the previous SARS-CoV variant.
HCoVs are of animal origin and understanding the origin of HCoVs in animals is very helpful.
Most HCoVs originate in the saliva and are not pathogenic.

The current outbreak of the CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the one that is being discussed in this context.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of viruses surrounded by a spore, each positive-sensed, and containing single-stranded RNA.
CoVs, or CoVs, is a genome of 26 to 32 kilobases of RNA, named after the corona-like genome found in yeast.
In vitro, CoVs have unmodified genomes and are co-located.
Two-thirds of the genome contains two large, related forms (ORF1a and ORF1b), which produce pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
Polyproteins are then processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, known as nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORFs on structural proteins, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).

The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are commonly associated with mild illness, such as the common cold and/or diarrhea.
Thus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, affecting the lower respiratory tract in the majority of patients and there is a high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was discovered in the urine of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.

2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The bell has been ringing and the world needs to prepare for the global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs originate from mosquitoes, mites or domestic animals.
The evidence for the existence of HCoVs is largely from mosquitoes, where the virus is stable and non-infectious but has a highly variable genetic structure.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created serious challenges in medicine, science, sociology and behaviour for China and the world.

We also studied how the HCoV mutates with increasing exposure and tends to decrease the risk of infection.
The effects of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
CoVs in animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E strain B814 was isolated from the samples of patients who had contracted the common cold, many CoVs had been isolated from many infected animals, including chickens, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.

SARS has infected 8,096 known cases and killed 774 people, spreading to many countries and continents.
Besides the most common transmitters, it has been estimated that each patient could infect two more people, with symptoms appearing in 4 to 7 days with the peak of viral load occurring on the 10th day of infection.
SARS-CoV patients initially experience joint pain, headache, malaria, diarrhea and diarrhea, followed by difficulty breathing, diarrhea and later fluid retention in the lungs.
Lymphopenia, deranged liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are some of the SARS complications that are seen in clinical trials.

Apart from the lower esophagus, numerous parts of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be injured in these severe conditions, often accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be fatal especially in patients with low immune levels.
The virus was first detected in a sample taken from the lungs of a relative of the first confirmed patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.

Though it was first seen in the Netherlands, it has actually spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of respiratory illnesses, and is most prevalent in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, or croup.

MERS-CoV was first detected in 2012 in the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had severe pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although all confirmed cases originate from the Middle East,foreign cases and contact infections have been detected in several European countries and Tunisia.
The latest outbreak was in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.

Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also developed kidney failure, which is currently the only MERS in HCoV-induced infections.
Over 30% of patients experience stomach problems, such as diarrhea and vomiting.


The World Health Organization has declared the current state of low-level disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and the disease is also called COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory damage as with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which can cause malaria, diarrhea and difficulty breathing.
The antibody is also found in some patients.
Tummy is one of the most severe symptoms and can spread rapidly causing problems in the train path.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
SARS-CoV-2 is less virulent but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 patients who do not show symptoms have been identified and may help to speed up its spread worldwide.
The comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 strain with six other HCoVs reveals similarities and differences that need to be identified.
First, the timing of the symptoms and the duration of HCoV infection are very similar.
SARS-CoV-2 shares the same behavior as the other six HCoVs.
Third, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, a person with SARS-CoV-2 has the most common symptoms seen in a person with HCoVs, which include unknown, mild or no symptoms.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Thirdly, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also indicates the characteristics found in the transmission of HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as strong as that of HCoVs.
On the other hand, it is not yet known whether SARS-CoV-2 infection decreases after transmission to humans as with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in negative samples.
The possibility of human SARS-CoV-2 infection as a negative as SARS-CoV in some cases has yet to be confirmed in future studies.
It is also important to see if SARS-CoV-2 may have had a period of self-reproduction as is the case with HCoVs.

In other words, both could be survivors of the previous HCoV pandemic.
The HCoVs that cause the most serious human infections and the most serious human infections with HCoVs have been eliminated.

The virus does not need to be hidden in the animal.
In comparison, the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses that cause the most disease are not well adapted to humans and the spread of the virus in humans is unlikely.
It must be present and active in the area and seek opportunities to touch the weak perhaps through one or more physically weak individuals and strengthen them.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar symptoms to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and to four other community-acquired viruses known as HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible like human HCoVs, at least as far as is currently known.

It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to humans and spread to humans in the open or to an animal that is resistant to the virus.

The HCoV-like organism is transmitted by the animal when it has a mutation that is similar to the virus by sharing the gene at the cell level.
The virus is usually adapted to the environment and does not cause infection.
Similarly, the infected virus is present with the HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, the host is the pathogen and is the host organism of the HCoV or the virus.
Thus, when the HCoV is introduced into a host virus before or during human infection, it is not adapted to the host and is more likely to spread disease.
A host virus can be a source of disease in humans and can play the role of host virus by allowing the virus to reproduce and infect humans and spread disease to humans.
HCoVs cannot spread if they cannot survive on a host virus.
In other words, HCoVs can adapt to a host virus and remain a host for a long time.
Infection is the result of a natural infection.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 originated from bat virus samples and was shown to use bat, bat and ACE2 in humans as an immune response to the virus.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Though there are strong genetic similarities between the two viruses, it is widely accepted that WIV1 is not a closely related variant of SAR-CoV and that the virus is not a closely related variant of SARS-CoV.
Studies of the evolution of the virus classify MERS-CoV in the same category as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host virus, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to inject the virus.
RNA of MERS-CoV is similar to that of beta-CoVs detected in Europe and Africa.

Supposedly, the animal that transmits the virus SARS-CoV-2 must be one of those wild species that are being sold and slaughtered in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the first confirmed COVID-19 outbreak was reported, there is a possible animal-to-human transmission of the disease.
Studies on genetic modification have suggested that a group of endangered animals called pangolins (Manis javanica) may also have antibodies to beta-CoVs similar to SARS-CoV-2.
This rare species of Pangolin contains the CoV gene sharing 85-92% with SARS-CoV-2.

Thus, the interval between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs of the pangolin.
The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other humanoids is not yet known.

It is believed that the strong similarity between RBDs in pangolin-resistant SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is dominated by isolated mutations.

As a driving force in mutation, interconvergence is common in beta-CoVs.
The decision has not yet been made for the animal strain of SARS-CoV-2.
Besides the most common pathogenic HCoVs, the animal origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been investigated.
The evolutionary evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from CoVs in mosquitoes, while the parent virus HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been identified in mosquitoes.
It was reported that the virus ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) was isolated in North America as a triple-colored virus and suggested a close relationship to HCoV-NL63.

It is safe to live in camels that have evolved from a host of non-transmitting bacteria to a host of receptive bacteria.
MERS-CoV causes a low infection and is rarely transmitted in these animals.
The MERS-CoV virus is transmitted to humans by accident and humans remain exposed to the virus but do not spread as transmission is not possible.

Pangolin beta-CoVs are the most common pathogenic strain of pangolins.
It may be a viral vector that transmits SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, as in the case of the SARS-CoV fungus.
The potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans is yet to be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.

It is possible that human-like animals including domestic pets can be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Third, as mentioned above, the genetic linkage to the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in the third species related to bats and pangolins.
Research on the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in animals is still ongoing.
Besides the animal species that are infected, three important aspects of the virus are also important in the process of removing CoVs to cut the barriers to replication.
First, their reproduction appears to be the highest in the genome (RNA).
In comparison to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the viral reproduction rate is estimated to be between wsamous and whigh with an average of ~10-4 per year per 2 positions, based on the CoV adaptation rate and the unknown virus specificity.
CoVs are able to break through exoribonuclease, and when detected results in a reduced or sometimes impossible progression.
Remdesivir is known to inhibit the replication of CoVs by inhibiting exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents being tested in clinical trials.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Similarly, the rate of infection is usually higher as CoVs are not known to infect.
Compared to SARS-CoV which has a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be low, suggesting that it has now become fully adapted to humans.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Apart from SARS-CoV-2, this also affects MERS-CoV, which is already known to camels.
In theory, it appears that a genetic mutation may lead to a slow-acting SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs suppresses the genetic structure of the mutant genome, thereby increasing the chance of the mutant species to be isolated, which is beneficial for the emergence of unknown CoVs in the presence of a pathogen.
This is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and the importance of the protein located at the 3′ end of the genome.
Thirdly, CoVs often also observe a mutation during reproduction through the koppa-collagen process.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
RNAs that are very similar to subgenomic RNAs can combine to form different CoVs.
Special information is the genetic information of the pathogenicity of the HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 viruses, as well as animal CoVs such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.

In SARS-CoV, RBD is present in the 318 to 510 amino acid sequence on the S1 fragment, which binds to ACE2 in humans and the host host.
SARS-CoV RBDs are able to isolate ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including bats, bats, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing for transmission to a wide range of species.

SARS-CoV-2 is also known to be a K479N and S487T RBD transcription factor, which may increase the binding of the spike protein to ACE2 in humans.
Kihone, amino acids may be a major factor in the evolution of the human genome.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares a similar pathogenicity to SARS-CoV.

It will also be interesting to see if another vector may be needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-NL63 is also activating ACE2 but using a different S subunit.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N on HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid on HCoV-OC43.
It can also explain the positive adaptation of the CoV virus in humans after it has spread to different species from the host animal.
Besides the inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent inherent
Differentiation in host proteins between humans and organisms that transmit HCoVs such as bats, camels and rodents can act as a barrier in the transmission of disease in different species.
HCoVs inhibit the host and bypass host barriers to effectively transmit disease to different species.

Genome-wide screening for SARS-CoV-2 viruses and pathogens using advanced technology may be successful. Genome-wide screening for SARS-CoV-2 viruses and pathogens using advanced technology may be successful.
The emergence of previously unknown HCoVs: back to basics
The variation in the CoVs of the virus presents a significant risk for the emergence of previously unknown HCoVs.
In this way, the fungal CoV acts as the genetic source of HCoVs.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
For example, the acquisition or loss of previously unknown protein-coding genes has the potential to completely alter the appearance of a virus.
SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 are thought to be important in human adaptation, as the SARS-CoV virus that is resistant to yeast has been isolated but found to have divergent ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoVs' 29-nucleotide deletion sign was detected in the virus isolated at the beginning of the human outbreak.
This splicing split ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a mutant adaptation promoting mutation in the host bacterium.
Additionally, SARS-CoV has a history of self-binding in alpha- and gamma-CoVs, with a number of self-binding in small RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Some contact points were detected in nsp9, mostly in nsp10, andparts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been reported that the MERS-CoV outbreak was a cross-infection, which occurred in a camel in Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the interactions have also been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs interact with animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It is also worth noting that human surveillance can lead to unobserved changes in viral genomes, most notably due to isolation of viruses from surveillance suppression, such as from viral vector.

Last but not least, the evolution of HCoVs has been unknown and is dominated by selective induction in the host.
Absorption or mild symptoms have been observed as the bat infects CoVs, suggesting a common adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats were familiar with CoVs both anatomically and in everyday life.
For example, structural defects in the sputum reduce the abnormality caused by CoVs.
Additionally, the biological cell death in bats is reported to be due to the decreased biological neutrality of the NKG2/CD94 virus and the lower expression of the active class I molecules.

Data yang kuat menunjukkan bahwa SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV dan SARS-CoV-2 berasal dari kutu dan disebarkan ke manusia melalui zat-zat yang tidak menular.
Since SARS-CoV infection is caused by human contact with mosquitoes in the marketplace, closing raw markets and mosquito repellents would be a great help in curbing the spread of SARS.
tango, pangolins have to be removed from raw markets to prevent the transmission of animal-to-human diseases, with a view to identifying the variants of pangolin beta-CoVs that are highly resistant to SARS-CoV-2.

To prevent the spread of MERS outbreaks, the vaccine for the disease should be developed to produce a MERS-CoV vaccine, in combination with other immunotherapy methods.
Due to the fact that we cannot eliminate this virus, another virus can emerge and cause another infection.

Especially, it is a virulent CoV that has the potential to transmit diseases from animals to humans in many forms.

The practice of eating wild animals in some areas in China should be dropped to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.

They stay in their natural habitat until they get a chance to move on.
Though bats have a wide range of biological activities, the chance of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are advised to avoid them.

Third, if an anthropomorphic animal behaves as a non-pathogenic organism, its interactions with other species including humans, bats and pangolins should be reported.
Lastly, as many human-like animals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and testing for the disease should be done.

The Watchtower of Jehovah's Witnesses of America is a worldwide Bible-based publication.
It should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge is increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical trials; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment are also changing.
Document on Testing and Treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, has just released a total of seven releases with some conditions completely changed.
Zhou and his colleagues, who developed a simple diagnostic system based on their findings in clinical practice.

We recognize and appreciate their fine work.

According to the seventh release (3 March 2020), confirming a suspected patient requires either combining one of the following medical history and two clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical
history of illness: (1) having visited or been in Wuhan and its environs, or other areas where COVID-19 cases were detected within 14 days before symptoms were detected; (2) having been in close contact with people with SARS-CoV-2 (by positive nucleic acid test); (3) having been in close contact with malaria or respiratory illness patients from Wuhan and its environs, or other areas where COVID-19 cases were detected within 14 days before symptoms were detected; (4) having been in close contact with infected patients (≥ 2 cases of leprosy and/or difficulty of entry were detected within 2 weeks, such as hospitals, clinics, schools, etc.).
Symptoms are: (1) malaria and/or difficulty breathing; (2) symptoms of missing a scan indicating COVID-19 exposure; (3) levels of white blood cells indicating normal, or decreased lymphocyte count at the initial time.
Certification should be done for suspected patient with evidence of infection or serum testing as described below: (1) when a PCR test shows positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) when viral whole genome sequencing shows strong similarity to the new coronavirus; (3) when serum testing shows positive for IgM antibody and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2; or when the change in serum IgG of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from negative to positive, or titer rising ≥4 days in recovery time than in the current period is more severe.
We see that the early PCR test for nucleic acid in urine or blood was added to the second issue (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Diagnosis in blood samples was added on the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and on the fifth (8 February 2020); and evidence of body fluid testing was added on the seventh edition.
The conversion is based on the work of researchers trying to develop a nucleic acid-sensitive reagent for rapid testing, together with samples from a blood sample, which increases the availability of different tests, and supports the presence of specific antibodies as one of the basis for confirmatory diagnosis.
Also, there are many other reminders to be careful of patients who show or show no unusual symptoms.

To reduce the shortage, Coles asked the couriers to make more bridges and increase the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered an increase in its inventory, and ALDI brought more as planned for the special Wednesday to arrive early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers were trying to increase their stock but the restrictions imposed by local authorities on the number of cars imported made it difficult for them.
He expects to increase the amount of money spent, as the ministers try to keep up with the demand and the short intervals.


He said that the chickpeas are so large that they are sold at such low prices that when they are sold out, the remaining chickpeas are left in the oven and the feeling of being short is created.
Russell Zimmerman, in ABC News, commented that "Coles and Woolworths think [that] when there is more supply in the market, when products like bottles and hand washes are [bought] and produced in quantity, the stacking can be reduced".

Kimberly-Clark, maker of Sorbent, and Solaris Paper, maker of Sorbent, both confirmed that they were working 24/7 to ensure they compete with demand, according to a report by News.com.au.

Organizaon de Saúde Mundial (WHO) declarao COVID-19 como pandemia mundial


"All nations can change the way this global crisis is spreading.
Dziiko liyenera kuyesa, kuyesa, kuchiza, kugawa, kuyang'anira ndi kusonkhanitsa anthu pankhaniyi", anatero Mkulu wa WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
"Tuna wasiwasi sana kuhusu jinsi ugonjwa huu unavyoenea na hatari na kutojaliwa sana".
Tom Frieden, a former Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), said that the pandemic "was a surprise".
"Like this, no other respiratory virus has been identified since its emergence to the global quarantine", he said, in a statement to CNN on Tuesday.
Ghebreyesus made a similar comment, saying "we have never seen a global outbreak caused by the coronavirus".
"Hopefully", he adds, "we haven't seen a global problem yet".
The new global pandemic status came after the WHO decided in January to declare the outbreak a global public health emergency.
Director of the United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, described the outbreak as, "a reoccurring phenomenon, one that is going to be remembered".

The 2019 global coronavirus pandemic20 is an ongoing pandemic of the 2019 pandemic (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The original estimate of the baseline number of variations (R0) of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that the number could be as high as 5.7.
The majority of people who contract COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with a maximum of 14 days in the general population.

The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may be higher because there may be no deaths without testing - to the point that people die at home, in nursing homes, etc.
A partial report from Italy found that the total number of deaths during the outbreak was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID figures.

The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the prevalence of HIV infection is generally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimates on this scale coincide with the results of the first detection of COVID-19 in Germany, and statistical studies that confirm the testing do not estimate mortality.
WHO has estimated that this global pandemic is preventable.
The progression and duration of the disease are unknown and may vary depending on the location.
"If the disease is not treated, it will spread and if it is not treated, it will spread", says Maciej Boni, of Penn State University.

On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine reported that SARS-CoV-2 "will be spreading, probably for a year or two".
According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, the withdrawal and follow-up will be necessary "until the vaccine is available (perhaps 18 months or more)".
"Nadhani kwamba virusi ya coronakwa sababu ya kuenea harakaitatoweka kabisa" huenda ikawa ugonjwa wa muda kwa kurudi kila mwaka", alisema William Schaffner wa Chuo Kikuu cha Vanderbilt.

Sum can go through the mouth or nose of nearby people or can be sucked into the lungs.
Some treatments such as radiation therapy and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause a leak in the urethra and thus spread the disease through the air.
It can also spread by touching an infected object, such as the body, the face, the joints, or the mouth.

The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 spreading in a negative manner. The virus is most likely to spread in the first three days after symptoms appear, although spread is possible before symptoms appear and in the final stages of the outbreak.


The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not clear how the virus is spread, it is generally spread by one person to two to three people. The virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
The virus was found to be resistant to exposure for three days on plastic (polypropylene) and a 304 degree stove, for one day on cardboard and for four hours on a tin.

There are no reports of animals transmitting the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend washing hands after touching animals, as well as touching objects that are touched by suspected infected people.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a previously unknown virus, first identified in three people who had a virus that was similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was found in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that is not known to be present in the body. Outside the body, the virus is killed by household soap, which kills the protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the first SARS-CoV detected.
Supposedly, the virus originated in animals and was transferred to humans.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus in its genetic structure is similar to the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) with two bat-derived strains.
It is about 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bacterial strains in its samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolins and the human pathogens.

Virus presence can be detected at baseline, but is usually confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in affected tissue or in computed tomography (CT imaging).

In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should be used to screen for or be used as a primary screening test for COVID-19".
WHO has released the results of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA test, the first of which was released on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The test is performed by a team of researchers.
The test can be performed on samples of the respiratory tract or blood.

Belgium threw away 100,000 unusable masks, thought to be from China, but actually from Colombia.

WHO inaguri China in efforts to contain and control the disease.
WHO has identified a difference between the 20022004 SARS outbreak, when Chinese authorities were urged to keep secrets that hindered efforts to prevent and control it,and the current crisis when the central government "regularly advises people to avoid contact in preparation for the Lunar New Year holidays".

WHO director Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was caused by "a global pandemic, especially in low- and middle-income countries that lack good health care.

Tedros also declared that "our strength is equal to our weakest link" and urged people around the world to "save today or pay the price". On 11 February, WHO at a press conference announced COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
Tedros, Jr., said on the same day that the UN Secretary General António Guterres had agreed to commit "all UN resources to the fight against disease".
The UN Crisis Management Team was established, to coordinate the efforts of the UN, which WHO says will help them "focus on health care as other agencies bring their expertise to help with social, economic and development issues during the pandemic".

Mike Ryan, director of WHO's health emergencies program, warned: "This is a self-examination for every government in the world: Wake up.
The virus may be on the way and you need to be prepared", he warned that having the right controls can help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also said that the current information does not lead health officials to declare this as a global pandemic, adding that such a declaration would mean that "we believe that everyone around the world will be affected by this virus".

The Director-General said that WHO was "very concerned about the high rate of spread and severity of the virus, and the lack of action being taken". WHO has been criticized for its apparent inaction in managing the disease, including delaying the declaration of an emergency health emergency and declaring it a global pandemic.
The protests included a call for the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, with the petition being signed by 733,000 people by 6 April.

Testing for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus includes both virus detection and antibody detection for the person who is infected with the virus.
The presence of the virus in the test samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
The test was performed by testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA only.
It is used to detect a new or late infection.
Antibodies (serology) can be used to diagnose disease or determine the number of people who have been infected.
Tests on antibodies show how many people have been infected, including those with very few symptoms without needing to go to hospital or those who have no symptoms.

Results are usually obtained in a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing for viral infection is reliable only in the first week of infection.
The virus can then disappear in the saliva as it multiplies in the lungs.
For patients tested in the second week, test samples may be taken from inside the airways using a suction catheter or a tracer may also be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in February 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and resulted in 250,000 test kits being provided to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Hong Kong introduced a stay at home policy whereby people suspected of being infected with the virus, "emergency department will give the patient a sample collection glass", the patient will be able to scan it, send it back and get the results of the test later. British NHS announced that it is testing a home test system for suspected infections, which eliminates the risk of infecting others if they go to the hospital or if the ambulance is used. In the process of testing for COVID-19 in suspected patients when they are found at home, the medical examiner does not follow the necessary precautions.
Drive-through centers have enabled South Korea to test faster, with more people than any other country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March, that it could test about 12,000 people per day in the out-of-home system and 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are covered by the insurance if the test is ordered by a doctor.

Various test kits targeting different coronavirus genes have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization recommended a German product to release tests for developing countries that have no capacity to produce their own.
The German vaccine was released on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not released until 28 January, delaying testing in the US. China and the US had problems with the accuracy of the diagnostic tools in the early stages of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to produce enough to satisfy the need for and approval by health professionals for the testing.
Thanks to the fact that the coronavirus is spreading.Thanks to the fact that the coronavirus is spreading.
The ability to test, especially in private experiments, was developed many years ago by the South Korean government.

In March 2020 China reported that there were problems with the accuracy of the testing materials.
In the United States, the CDC's testing kit had problems; the government removed the restrictions that had prevented private testing. Spain purchased the test from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were incorrect.
The company explained that the false results could be due to a failure to collect samples or to use reliable tests.

Testing, followed by quarantine of those who tested positive and screening for close contacts with SARS-CoV-2, yielded positive results.
e Vò, Italy, where the first COVID-19 death in Italy occurred, researchers conducted two rounds of testing on all 3,400 people, ten days apart.
Total, about half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all those who tested positive were quarantined.
Since they were denied access to the public, the possibility of new infections was cancelled.

The statistics found that countries with the highest test rates, compared to the highest death rates, had the lowest death rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect those with few or no symptoms.
WHO initializes that countries with limited testing capacity and countries with limited COVID-19 experience should submit their first five samples of COVID-19 patients and the first ten live samples to one of the 16 WHO testing interviews to confirm their testing.
Of these 16 studies, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America and 1 is in Australia.

Sanifitéres non-alcoholics dependent on their content, and historically are less effective than alcohol and alcohol-containing sanitizers.

In the developing world, many people do not have access to soap, so they use only ashes and dirt.
Ash or dirt may be more efficient than pure water, but it may not be as efficient as soap.

Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because when it comes in contact with water, it turns alkaline.
WHO has recommended using ash or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.

Promoting handwashing with soap can change the country's policies, educating people about the benefits of handwashing and radically changing people's lifelong habits.

70 studies have found that community-based practices in developing countries (LMICs) are effective in encouraging hand washing; however, the practice of hand washing is not. An example is UNICEF's "Three Star Approach"; this approach includes encouraging schools to use simple and inexpensive practices in encouraging students to wash their hands with soap, as part of their hygiene requirements.

Global Hand washing Day is also a good example of how to use the campaign to encourage a change in behaviour.Due to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF created an online campaign to encourage people to wash their hands.


The importance of handwashing to human healthespecially for people in a state of emergencylike women in hospital or wounded soldierswas first emphasized in the mid-19th century by Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked at the Vienna, Austria, hospital and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern medicine".

OSHA's policy is to make sure that doctors/nurses work in areas where there is a high risk of COVID-19 infection, and that risk is increased when the staff collects samples from the body of a person who has died or is suspected of having died of COVID-19.
Treatments for these workers include building techniques, such asairproofing from one room to another, andfitness protection appropriate to the person's job.
The spread of COVID-19 can have a wide range of effects on employment.

Lastly, transportation of goods from COVID-19 affected areas may be disrupted. Prepare for infectious diseases and prevent them is necessary to help guide the prevention efforts.
Planes look at the risk factors associated with the various workplaces and the workplace itself, including the effects of vaccination, risks from home and community, and other risk factors such as age or chronic illness.
They establish the necessary restrictions to deal with the risks, and the necessary precautions to deal with the potential for the spread of the disease.

Objectives of controlling emergent diseases include reducing the spread of infectious diseases among employees, protecting people at risk of infection from serious illness, continuing operations, and reducing the impact on those with whom businesses interact in the course of their services.
The prevalence of the disease in the business community is leading to a lack of effective management.
Problem prevention is a widely used methodology in the world to classify workplace and life problems by classifying the best practices.
COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, firstly through effective engineering controls, secondly through administrative controls and lastly through individual controls.
Engineering controls involve the removal of workers from the labour market without regard to work ethic and are the least expensive to implement.
Administrative controls
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be ineffective in preventing infection or management but can contribute to the prevention of infection.
All PPE should be selected based on the worker's risk profile, should be placed where appropriate and safe (e.g. when removed), worn regularly and safely, inspected regularly, maintained, restored to a safe level, removed as necessary, cleaned, stored or discarded to avoid infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have few outside contacts and few coworkers.

OSHA places some healthcare workers and warehouse workers at a very high risk of contracting the disease.

They are at a higher risk when staff are involved in aerosol-generating procedures on patients or when they are handling samples from people known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Aerosol-generating procedures include aerosol scanning, bronchoscopies, dental procedures, or invasive specimen collection. Aerosol-generating procedures include aerosol-generating procedures, bronchoscopies, dental procedures, or invasive specimen collection. Aerosol-generating procedures include aerosol-generating procedures, bronchoscopies, dental procedures, or invasive specimen collection.
Tasks with high risk of working on the dead include preparing the bodies of people who were known to be sick or suspected of having COVID-19 at the time of death; these are at high risk when they are examined for the dead.Engineering controls for these high risk groups include the use of isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including aerosol-generating procedures.

Samples collected from humans should be handled with the utmost care (Biosafety Level 3 precautions).
WHO initializes new patients to be isolated and placed in special waiting areas if they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other PPE procedures, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those working within 6 feet of SARS-CoV-2 patients or suspected patients and those working on aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 masks or higher must be used under strictly regulated conditions including pre-testing, user training, training, and clinical screening.

Office conditions, installation, and cleaning
We were informed last week that one of our colleagues in San Francisco has apparently been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
"Besides, with great care, we got disinfected and sprayed the whole space and stuff in the San Francisco office."
They used pesticides to disinfect everything, from the elevator poles that reached the ceiling of our office to the floorboards.

We feel calm that the office will be well organized when we decide to return to work.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, and the site has shown us its COVID-19 response plan and all staff members have taken this initiative.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a protein that binds to the surface (cell membrane) of proteins in the liver, vascular system, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 acts as a precursor to the immunity of certain coronaviruses. ACE2 is also a precursor to the immunity of certain coronaviruses. ACE2 is also a precursor to the immunity of certain coronaviruses. ACE2 is also a precursor to the immunity of certain coronaviruses. ACE2 is also a precursor to the immunity of certain coronaviruses. ACE2 is also a precursor to the immunity of certain coronaviruses. ACE2 is also a precursor to the immunity of certain coronaviruses. ACE2 is also a precursor to the immunity of certain coronaviruses. ACE2 is also a precursor to the immunity of certain coronaviruses. ACE2 is also a precursor to the immunity of certain coronaviruses. ACE2 is also a precursor to the immunity of certain coronaviruses. ACE2 is also a precursor to the immunity of certain coronaviruses.
In humans this compound is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of blood cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein is a member of the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane, with its major components appearing on the surface of the mucous membrane and other tissues.
ACE2 is secreted by a molecule called sheddase, which then transfers the protein hydrate into the bloodstream and then into the urine.
ACE2 is found in most tissues: ACE2 binds to the cell membrane, particularly the type II membrane of the lymph nodes, the small intestine, the vascular and lymphatic systems, and the lymph nodes of the nervous system in most tissues.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the brain's membrane, peripheral, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
ACE2's primary function is to regulate ACE
ACE binds to the angiotensin I hormone in the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 then binds to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and is secreted in the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also bind to various chains including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the cell cycle of the neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is suspected to be involved in Hartnup syndrome.
As a cell-mediated protein, ACE2 acts as a key gateway to immunity to some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus).

A careful review of the results of the scientific study published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was up to 34% less likely to cause diarrhea than other prescribed drugs.
Also, "the risk of pneumonia was reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at risk of pneumonia, particularly those with menopause and heart disease.
"Use of ACE inhibitors has also been thought to reduce malaria mortality, although the results were not as dramatic as the risks posed by malaria"
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be the most successful treatment for severe lung damage, and has been shown to improve neural adhesion and respiratory movement in younger patients with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The decrease of rhACE2 in humans takes 10 hours and the activation begins in 30 minutes with a 24-hour activation time (duration).

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Symptoms include malaria, nausea, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include a broken hip, nose pain, runny nose, diarrhea, difficulty in breathing, and abdominal pain.
The time from the onset to the onset of symptoms is usually five days but can vary between two and fourteen days.



The fountain, which is usually a fountain, usually falls on the ground or on objects, and does not reach people over long distances.
Also, people can contract the disease by touching the infected area, such as their face, nose, or lips.
The virus can live on anything for 72 hours.

Symptoms that are not often seen include, upper symptoms of the upper jaw such as thinning, runny nose or runny nose.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying degrees.
At first, some patients in China first feel a pressure in the chest and the muscles are beating.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the birth cycle.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually between five and six days but can be extended to between two and 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms develop them within 11.5 days of contracting the disease. Reports show that not all people who develop symptoms develop symptoms.
The role of asymptomatic viruses in the transmission of disease is not yet fully understood; however, preliminary data suggest that they may transmit disease.
Currently unknown and under investigation, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases were asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
China's National Health Commission started counting asymptomatic cases among daily cases on 1st April; out of 166 cases that day, 130 patients (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.

Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may contain airborne toxins and thus result in airborne infections.Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may contain airborne toxins and thus result in airborne infections.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although transmission is slow, on average one person infects two to three others. The virus lasts between an hour and days on surfaces.
Specialists have found that the virus can be absorbed after one day on a canvas, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and non-toxic materials (AISI 304), and four hours on 99% copper-containing materials.

Safe and detergent are also effective when used properly; soap products remove protective skin, de-inflammatory and remove all mould and other impurities.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the disease was first detected: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to any particular place (e.g. China), species or group of people, following international conventions to avoid discrimination. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO is also using "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus proof" in their public communications.

Preliminary studies of SARS-CoV are used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter the human immune system.
There are three types of vaccine being studied.
First, researchers are aiming to develop a vaccine against the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether alive or dead, aims to create a new immune response to the new disease and COVID-19.
subunit vaccines, a methodology that aims to create a vaccine that causes the immune system to block the virus when it attacks the body.

Third method is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating a vaccine).Third method is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating a vaccine).
Vaccines tested from these systems will require testing for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial began with four volunteer trials in Seattle.
Vaccine contains harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Immunity has been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is misleading.

Seven trials were conducted to evaluate already approved malaria drugs, including four trials on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The antibody used to treat other diseases is the largest component of the Chinese trial, with nine phase III trials of remdesivir across several countries due to be released in late April.
Tests for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and potential drug were conducted in April 2020.Tests for the development of a common antibiotic are being conducted to determine whether it is effective in treating COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.

There was a surge in patients treated with compassionate-use remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which is used to treat malaria, was tested in China in February 2020, with some preliminary findings.

Health officials in Korea and China are supporting the use of chloroquine.

The results suggest that higher doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was supported for further study in biology after showing weakness in the initiation of SARS-CoV-2. The findings suggest that initial spike protein priming of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is important for inducing SARS-CoV-2 binding to the ACE2 receptor.
Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and efficacy is unknown for COVID-19. Oseltamivir is not effective in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its efficacy is unknown for COVID-19.
Cytokine storm can be a severe deficiency as COVID-19 spreads.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. Tocilizumab has been approved by the China National Health Commission for clinical use after a limited trial.
It is in phase 2 of a nationwide pre-exposure trial in Italy following the detection of symptoms in the population.
It is now being used in serum ferritin blood tests to detect cytokine storms, and aims to detect such events, which are thought to be fatal in some patients.
