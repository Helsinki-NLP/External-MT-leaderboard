While it appears that one experimental vaccine may reduce Ebola mortality, there is no clear evidence that any drugs are effective at treating the existing infection.
One of the antibody mixtures, ZMapp, initially offered hope in this area, but studies have shown that it is not as effective at preventing deaths as previously thought.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning that the researchers used it as a starting point and compared it with three other treatments.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs were feathered (a widely held theory), but provides data that fossils cannot usually provide, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were brownish-brown above and pale or carotenoid below.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaurs did not have a well-developed shaft called the tail, but had other feather features - lateral branches and spines - researchers concluded that the tail likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used to regulate temperature or to make an appearance rather than to fly.
Researchers said that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the adult's flapper, not the young's flapper.

In France, voting has traditionally been a non-technical activity: voters enter the voting booth and place a piece of paper with the nominated candidate in the envelope.
After the officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.

Since 1988, the ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the voting and that no additional envelopes are added, only those put in by the correctly counted and entitled voters.
Candidates can send representatives to monitor each stage of the process.

In cooperation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been selected for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Micko O'Flynn, director of park conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the nine-member interim Electoral Council (CEP).
Martel and the Interim Electoral Council meet for the fifth time in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former Interim Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Martelly Commission was a reaction to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The failure of elections, some even since 2011, has led to protests that have erupted in violence.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that it was aware of 27 accidents involving equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "nervous".
The Ministry responded by calling the delay in the Apple report 'really regrettable'.
The Mariana quake struck at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office, no casualties have been reported by residents.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila.
Roland Mendoza shot the tourists with an M16.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, and photographers from the Philippines, have been released.
The photographers later switched to an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working in a hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth.
His study showed that taking the hormone accelerated the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, government investigators recovered data from two flight black box loggers.
Other witches also paid tribute to Moon.
Tommy Dreamer once said, "Luna was the first emergency queen, my first boss, Luna died on the night of the second moon, as unique as she was, a strong woman".
Dustin Gold Runnels commented, "Luna was as strange as I was... maybe even stranger... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place now".
Even before the 2010 federal election, polls of 1,400 people revealed an 8 percent increase in opponents of Australia becoming a republic compared with 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard confirmed that she believed that Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34 percent of those polled who want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
As for radical responses, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
Olympic gold medallist in the 100m and 200m freestyle and triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but complaints have raised questions about his fitness.
He couldn't take pain medication because it's illegal during the games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known.
By the end of February, several people had tested the invention using various software and hardware, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It could be that comets brought water and organic matter to Earth that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the earth formed because comets collided with the earth a long time ago.
Governor Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors political nonsense and stupidity.
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen  is a system that the FAA claims that by flying shorter routes, aircraft could save millions of litres of fuel and reduce carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite technology rather than older ground-based radar technology to help air traffic controllers better locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional transport, no underground trains at Wembley and no parking and ride-hailing services.
Fears of a lack of transportation led to the possibility of games being played behind closed doors without team guards.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in just two generations, although the process was expected to take much longer due to the crossing of the endemic medium-sized ground squirrel (Geospiza forte) and the migratory large-sized ground squirrel (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be shaped in many ways, rolled into small moulds.
It can be drawn to make a thin wire that can be twisted or twisted, or it can be used to fold or roll sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal, and it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the chemical pH. You can make an indicator from red cabbage juice.
The colour of cabbage juice indicates the amount of acid or base (alkaline) content.
The pH level refers to the amount of hydrogen ions (H for pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions  are protons from which their electrons have been removed (a hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two types of powder and then crush them with clean wet hands.
The moisture in the hands will react with the outer layers, which are not very clean, and form a protective coating.
In the towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every home had a toilet with running water connected to a fancy sewage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in homes in Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were already in use in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public markets where men and women were in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite connection.
A satellite in space receives the signal and returns it almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and images.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket about 100 feet [30 m] high is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest benefit of the wheel is that it's much easier and faster to transport.
He provided us with a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
The other group  medium-sized cats, feeding on medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And the last  are small cats (including domestic cats in the wild), which eat a much wider variety of prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a sense of place  a special task that each cat must perform that prevents him from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called packs.
The family consists of one to three closely related adult males and up to 30 females and young.
Females are usually closely related  as a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave similarly to wolves or dogs (even lions, but not other cats, similar animals) and are also ruthless with their prey.
A large, athletic animal, the tiger can climb (though not perfectly), swim, jump long distances, and have five times the traction of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar.
The roar of a tiger is not the same as the roar of a lion, but it is more like a loud roar of a sentence.
They like to eat small animals, and if they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and detect prey by scent, by sniffing the soil where they have been.
They are very good at seeing in the dark because they have night vision, and they move very quickly.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belonged (e.g. crossing a mountain range, crossing a river or moving to a new island and not being able to return easily), it often finds itself in an environment that is different from the one in which it lived before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so for a new population to be a strong competitor, it will need different characteristics or changes than before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptation.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it begins to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be classified as the same species.
We call this process the formation of new species, and the formation of new species is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and it's part of the carbon dioxide that humans breathe.
Plants make food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based.
Mosasaur was the most powerful predator of his time, so he was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and it had a top mouth, meaning that no one in its path could escape.
We don't know for sure, but it could have been a tongue that was out of joint, eating turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, maybe even a cannibal.
It would attack anyone who entered the water, even a giant Tyrannosaurus would not match it.
Many of their foods are familiar to us, but the Romans also had strange or unusual variations on dishes, including pork, poultry, snails and a rodent called a dormouse
Another difference was that the poor and the women ate on the couches, while the rich enjoyed banquets where they sat on their sides while eating.
The ancient Roman diet could not have included foods that had been brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, no ancient Roman had even tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the main house of the god.
People sacrificed to the gods, and priests sought to satisfy the gods' needs during ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers zirkurata were built as part of temples.
A special temple was built on top of the tower for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a home was not so important.
Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard, shops were just open stalls facing the street, and houses were built with stones.
The land of Canaan was sparsely forested, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to ancient Norse mythology, Eric the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and travelled farther west to discover Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite its discovery, the area was already inhabited by Eskimos.
Although each country is considered Scandinavian, there are considerable differences in the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Code: L.O.B.I.A.I., you might think that the other side of the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map drawn on it.
But that's not true. Although there's something written on the other side of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The other side of the Declaration of Independence was inscribed The original Declaration of Independence, signed on July 4, 1776.
Although no one knows exactly who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence this large parchment document - measuring 29 1/2 by 24 1/2 inches [29 x 24 1/2 inches] - was wrapped for safekeeping.
It is therefore likely that this comment was written simply as a title.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting had liberated the north of France, but the south was still occupied.
The area was controlled by the Vichy French, who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and worked together instead of fighting the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what became known as Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces were able to liberate the south of France and turn on Germany.
Civilization  is a specific culture characterized by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also somehow defines the size of the community.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations.Culture of civilization means the transmission of knowledge from one generation to another, the continuing cultural heritage and the considerable diffusion.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving behind any solid historical evidence and without being recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government (of which Congress was the only part) based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to regulate taxes and, in the absence of a national executive or judicial system, relied on state authorities, which were largely uncooperative in all their actions.
It also had no power to ignore tax laws and tariffs between States.
Changing the Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states, and the central government of the states was so carelessly adopted that their representatives often did not participate.
The Italy national football team is the second most successful team in the world, after the German national football team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports: football, basketball, netball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, wheelchair racing and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the Nordic regions  Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu, making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the island group that Japan has, it is often called island in a geographical sense
Taiwan was discovered in the 15th century when European sailors visited and named it Ilha Formosa, meaning "Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to transform native grain production practices and recruiting Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan in 1683, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Makchu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Windows Room.
Many of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better understanding of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been rebuilt, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world's most common still image format is 35 mm, which dominated the late analogue era.
It is still in production today, but more importantly, it has been replaced by the width-to-height ratio of digital camera video sensors.
The name of the 35 mm format is misleading, in fact it is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the marginal ratio of this format (divided by 12 to obtain the ratio of the smallest healthy numbers) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family of formats) are equivalent to or very close to this video format.
The often overused and derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics and maintains a degree of order in the image.
It states that the most efficient location of the main object is at the intersection of the lines dividing the view into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, attracted much attention.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound European nations together despite differences in language and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from kings to commoners.
A basic Christian principle is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church treasury should be used for that purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money had led many to question the adherence to such a doctrine.
Soon after this aggression, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that the blockade violated universally accepted international law, enshrined in several international treaties concluded over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom mined international waters to prevent ships from entering any part of the ocean and to prevent even inefficient state ships from being endangered.
With the tactic having been poorly responded to, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1930's, most people and entire nations lived in a world of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations hoped to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offer from the Edison Company, based in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former supervisor, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods; each stage of China, or each ruling family, was a distinct dynasty.
The inter-dynastic rule of the divided provinces was also a period of instability, most notably the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars were fought between many great ones vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, when thousands died fighting for the right to the throne, the main seat of the great court in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to one ruler.
After the revolution, all men who wanted to join the occupation were free, where luck smiled on the most ambitious and successful.
The same can be said of the army. Now military ranks were given based on personal qualities rather than class.
The French Revolution inspired the oppressed working class of many other countries to organize their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things that lay beyond the scope of his daily life. He often visited the cave of the Noor (light) mountain, which became known as the Hira, to meditate.
The cave itself, which has endured years of testing, provides a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave was on a mountain top north of Mecca, thus completely isolated from the outside world.
Even if you knew that a cave existed, it's not easy to find it.
Nothing is seen except the glaciers, the beautiful sky above and the many mountains around.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau (also known as the Giza Necropolis) in Egypt's Valley of the Dead is home to several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The top cut-off  has a V-shape and the bottom cut-off   has a form of a line or square without a bottom.
up means you should start at the end and push the string, and down means you should start at the tip (where your hand holds the string) and pull the string.
The upper stroke usually produces a softer sound, while the lower stroke  is stronger, more severe.
Do not hesitate to write the notes by hand, but remember that the printed notes are for musical reasons and should generally be respected.
In the wake of the panic of King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 years old Marie-Thérèse and 4 years old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, on 6 October 1789, a crowd of market women was forcibly driven from Versailles to Paris.
They were driven back to Paris, surrounded by a mob shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to open wide the windows of the carriage.
At one point, someone in the crowd held out the head of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The cost of the war of U.S. imperialism to conquer the Philippines was borne by the Filipinos themselves.
They were persuaded to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover most of the costs and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government (but using Wall Street banks).
Of course, the profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos were the main revenue stream for U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which these events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages  is the period between the Early and Late Middle Ages.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of practical ideas  from technological progress or necessity to the precise meaning that human fate is determined by the internal logic of the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology itself goes in a direction that essentially transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has an impact on society that is natural rather than dependent on social conditions.
For example, someone might say that the car will inevitably make roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable if it is used by only a few cars, and new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of cars.
The proliferation of cars on the roads has led to an increase in accidents, which has contributed to the development of new health care methods for treating physical injuries.
Romanticism is strongly influenced by cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schleier.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and eventually associated customs and cultures that were more appropriate to the social place than randomly imposed laws.
Just as Paris is now famous as the fashion capital of modern times, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It rose to prominence as an epicenter of luxury around 400 C.E. and continued until about 1100 C.E.
In the 12th century, its status declined largely because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of slow communication, the style sometimes took 25 to 30 years to reach the West.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own styles, and one of the most important changes that came about was the Crusades, when people started to cover their clothes with scarves.
Natural agriculture is agriculture carried out with the aim of growing enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural farming is a simple, often ecological system that uses seeds from the local ecoregion and uses crop rotation or other fairly simple methods to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers have been organic farmers, and in many developing countries, this practice continues.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel they don't fit into society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender.
The characteristics that characterize a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most popular ways to show the importance of socialization is to take the example of several failed children who grew up not being socialized because of neglect or deliberate abuse by adults.
Some of these children were ostracized by society (usually their own parents); at times, they were abandoned because their parents did not recognize their child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced significant violence or trauma before being abandoned or before fleeing.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some lived in the wild on their own.
If a feral child is raised by someone other than humans, he will behave (as far as his physical abilities allow) much like his caregiver, for example, he will be afraid of people or ignore them.
While design learning should make learning easier and more enjoyable, hands-on learning is even more beneficial.
The aim of the project is to provide a platform for the exchange of information and best practice on the use of computer software.
The desks can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is in the form of a desk, but the same can be said about the Microsoft Office dashboard.
The virtual tables are embedded in the software and are designed to discuss, encourage and explain to the student difficult procedures that he cannot handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to violence and even rape.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educating, but it is.
We think the foster care system is like a safety zone for these kids.
Our care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Caregivers should provide everything that the child lacks in the home from which he was taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The Internet's unique characteristics lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, learning and socialization are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
J. Eighmey and L. McCord (1998) also identified new motivational aspects in their study of audience reactions to a website: personal participation and permanent relationships.
Using video, we've made important discoveries in explaining facial expressions, facial movements, which can take milliseconds.
First, it claims that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting a microfiche.
In his book, The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks argues that people who cannot understand speech because of a brain injury are better at recognizing sincerity.
He even claims that animals, such as domestic dogs, can have this ability to understand human behavior.
20th-century research has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation and the selection removes it from the combined sample of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination result in mixing of variants in two groups per generation.
In savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to obtain amino acids from available plant sources.
This deficiency has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest sources of protein to get are leaves and seeds, but it's hard for primates like us to digest without them.
In contrast, animal foods (egg yolks, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide a high protein content containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, you shouldn't be surprised that our ancestors approached the problem of bleaching in much the same way that today's chimpanzees do in the savannah.
Sleep interruption is the purposeful awakening from normal sleep and falling asleep after a short time (1060 min).
This can be done easily using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without waking you up at all.
If you turn off your alarm clock while sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based alternative is to drink plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, as this will cause the sleeper to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less stress you have, the more self-confidence and vitality you feel.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way of that is your stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been extended by the Mahayana path of love and many Indian yoga practices.
Essentially, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, and it's made up of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini Yoga is the practice of activating kundalini energy through various yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, where visualizing the various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and achieves enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the cooperation of the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
This continued for another 40 years, and was fought in real combat with mercenary armies from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Polish defenses were already defeated and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian front.
However, these plans were abandoned almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, creating the Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts.
The use of ships for transporting goods is still the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the Navy's job has been to ensure the movement of people and goods within your country, and to prevent the enemy from moving their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mostly submarines, tried to stop the transport of these cargoes.
If the Allies had lost, Germany would probably have been able to defeat Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
The first goats are believed to have been domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient peoples and tribes began to keep them for their milk, wool, meat, and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds, roaming hills or other pastures, often under the care of goatherds, usually children or teenagers, similar to the more well-known herds, and this is still the case today.
The railway came to England in the 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horse-drawn wagons to move faster and to pull larger loads than the uneven roads of the day.
Although the idea of a railway track was developed long ago to strengthen the track, it gradually became apparent that a metal railway track was more effective.
This became common practice, but the iron wore away more than the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones.
The first known form of travel was walking, and people started walking upright two million years ago -- that's when Homo erectus came along.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not always walk.
Evidence of adaptation to walking on two legs can be seen in the 4.2 to 3.9 million-year-old Australopithecus fossils, but Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living less environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce the likelihood of future suffering to some degree.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment, but to overcome a temporary problem, we need to find and eliminate the root causes.
Clearly, the world has been greatly changed by human scientific and technological advances, and problems have been compounded by overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now known as Dunlap flyers.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One such document was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap copies that still exist are the oldest known copies of the document.
Most modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today, and we call them birds.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But birds still retained many similarities to dinosaurs.
Their feet were with claws and claws, they laid eggs and walked on two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
Basically all computers in use today are based on operations with information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number has only one of two values, which is 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or in computer jargon  bits.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are fairly common and may not be immediately diagnosed.
The clearest indicator of indoor poisoning  an open container for medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Find first aid instructions for the specific substance that you have been poisoned with on the label.
Entomologists formally call this group of insects black.
The term comes from the ancient bed bugs, which are perfectly adapted to be parasites on humans.
Both the female and the male are endophilic, adapted to live in their host's nest or nest.
With about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, it is considered the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop IS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in the best interests of them or their child.
The couple can make a plan for adopting their child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents waive their parental rights so that the child can be adopted by another couple.
The main goal of science is to find out about the existence of the world and the things that are related to it by using the scientific method.
But that's not the only thing  an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions, and observations also help guide research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were popular in all branches of science, including psychology.
The Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq was set on fire during the riots.
Most of the physiological and behavioural rhythms observed are often highly dependent on the presence and formation of endogenous cycles in biological clocks.
Periodic cycles, which are not a response to recurrent external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-generating generators that maintain cyclicity even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important attempts to prove that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments, labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with  radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations at the germ level can be passed on to offspring, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife.
Activities offered include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small towns to their workplaces, and others pass by whose workplaces are in the area they just left.
In this dynamic on-road vehicle system, everyone is somehow connected and supports a vehicle system based on private cars.
According to science, this large-scale carbon economy has destroyed the stability of the biosphere that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems.
In developed lands, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems have such complaints, why do they have problems every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is the problem more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, traffic analysis is difficult because it is impossible to predict drivers' behaviour with 100% accuracy.
It is good that drivers behave fairly uniformly on the road; therefore, traffic flows usually have a reasonable degree of consistency and can be calculated mathematically.
In order to improve the transmission of traffic flow, the links between three main characteristics are defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships contribute to the planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and find food and friends more efficiently.
The advantage of many insects is that they can fold their wings backward along their body.
This allows them to hide from predators in many small places.
Today, the only insects that cannot spread their wings are the ticks and the droplets.
Thousands of years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many thought otherwise: that the solar system, along with the sun (and other stars), revolves around the earth.
It makes sense, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, almost six miles wide.
20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the pyramids were built of stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size or technological sophistication.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their forefathers, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world, with the least population.
Italian is the language of Vatican legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by most civil servants, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the people in the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they are found in nature in their natural form and can be easily mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also developed the theory that they evolve into new materials that make up what we see.
The alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, but there are also other metals, silver and gold.
You can also have alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them would fit into a period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil's status and usage declined with the advent of newer writing methods.
Now people are texting on their computer screens and they never have to look for a chip.
You can only imagine what the keyboard will be like when some new technology comes along.
The nuclear bomb operates on the principle that a nucleus with many protons and neutrons requires a lot of energy to sustain itself.
It's like pushing a heavy truck up a mountain, and the nucleus splits again, releasing some energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to decay with little or no friction.
The lunar surface is made of rocks and dust.
The plume is about 70 km thick at the nearest and 100 km thick at the farthest sides.
It's thinner under the Moon Sea and thicker at higher altitudes.
There could be more lunar seas on the near side, because the surface is thinner, so it was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what turns people on or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories look at what makes certain people want what they do and what environmental factors make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start to lead their former colleagues, there are two types of behaviors that can occur.
Such leaders find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to maintain discipline, to evaluate work, to assign responsibilities, and to manage people.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who thinks you need to change the whole teamwork to be you.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This often causes disagreements between managers and other team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but with minor differences.
Virtual team members are often the contact persons for their immediate physical group.
They are often more autonomous than normal team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones that may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFaste, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
Invisible Team is a management team to which all members report.
Why should an organisation spend so much time building up a training organisation?
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional divisions of the organisation, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
The organisation therefore works together to overcome the obstacle and create a new process that meets the customer's need.
To make an organisation innovative, managers must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organisations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neurobiological data provide physical theoretical evidence for the study of cognition, and therefore narrow the scope of research and make it much more specific.
The link between brain disease and behavior supports the hypothesis of the researchers.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
With the advent of new technologies, we have the opportunity to see and explore structures and processes in the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to help us build simulation models and better understand processes.
Although AI has a strong connotation in science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavioral, learning and intelligent adaptation in machines.
AI is the study of machines that automate tasks that require intelligent actions.
Examples include management, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering and military sectors and is also integrated into several home computer and video game applications.
Excursions are an important part of any classroom, and often teachers would like to take their students to places where the bus is not available.
Technology provides the solution  virtual tours, where students can see historical artifacts in museums, visit an aquarium or admire amazing art from their classroom.
Sharing the excursion in a virtual way is a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future groups.
For example, every year at Bennett School in North Carolina, students create a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is rebuilt, but the old versions are stored online as a memory album.
Blogs can also improve students' writing, and while students' grammar and spelling are often lax in their first few blogs, the audience usually changes.
Since students are often the most critical audience, a blogger tries to write as perfectly as possible to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging encourages students to think more broadly about the world around them.The need to engage the audience inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool to inspire collaboration and encourage students to learn beyond the confines of traditional school.
Properly used blogs can help learners develop analytical and critical thinking skills; by actively responding to online material, learners can express themselves in the light of other people's posts, as well as describe their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's fascinating, bilingual capital city, with its many art galleries and museums that blend Canada's past and future.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the pristine natural beauty of Lake Muscoco and other areas.
All these and other things in Ontario are considered by immigrants to be elements of true Canada.
Farther north, large areas are sparsely populated, and some areas are almost deserted.
A population comparison that may surprise many: There are fewer Canadian citizens than African Americans living in the United States.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are famous for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it was successfully adopted in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India bypassing the Cape of Good Hope.
The region is bounded on the north by the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travellers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also advisable to buy a ring (but not one that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that because of cultural differences, they may experience what they might consider harassment: being followed, being held by the hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and not afraid to stand up for your own standards (cultural differences do not make this right).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. It was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenians as a strategic port, known as Anfos.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the most unusual shopping destinations in Morocco.
Traditional Moroccan products such as tadjins, pottery, leather goods, calzones, and various other items are easily found around the old Medina, but they are all for tourists.
Goma  is a tourist town in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Niragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, it is important to obtain information before traveling outside Goma to understand the situation in North Kivu.
From there, you can also climb Niragongo and book one of Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla hikes.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to travel around Goma.
Given its difficult accessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for exotic and remote islands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation is a tourist attraction, with an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to desert sand.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecological zones, each of which protects a different species.
It is  one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the best example of a South African National Park (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily maintenance and entrance fees.
It may be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which can be used to enter either certain South African parks or all South African national parks.
The name Hong Kong Territory is derived from the name of Hong Kong Island, which is also a major tourist attraction.
Reportedly, Allen, one of the world's richest men, invested much of his fortune in marine exploration and began his quest to find the musashi that would dominate his life.
For a good view of Hong Kong, leave the island and sail to Kauluna, on the opposite shore.
Most of Hong Kong Island's cities are built on reclaimed land along its northern coast.
This is a place that was claimed by the British colonialists, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this area, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest area of entire mangroves in the world, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) from the coast to Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans  UNESCO World Heritage Site. A part of the forest, located in the territory of India, is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps but also some of the last remnants of the mighty jungle of trees and shrubs that once grew on the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3 850 km2 of which about one third is water/swamp area.
The Sundarbans have been home to wildlife since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now some 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 tiger monkeys.
Buses from the district bus station (over the river) run throughout the day, although most buses, especially those going east and Jakarta/Bumtang, run between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since long-distance buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts are served by comfortable and durable Japanese buses called Coaster.
The public taxi is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Para (Nu 150) and Punaka (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects Oiapoque, Brazil, with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.

The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres.The construction was completed in August 2011 but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be operational from September 2017, when the Brazilian border inspection posts should be fully equipped.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters who also worked as subsistence farmers.
The Chaka region was inhabited by other indigenous tribes, such as the Gwai'kurai and the Pai'kwai, who survived by hunting, gathering goods, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Great Indian Province", emerged from the encounters between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century-long colonization.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve its local character and identity.
Agrigento is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.

Bank cards may not be accepted in some remote islands, but it may be possible to use the United Kingdom and United States currencies.
It is almost impossible to change Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change your money before leaving.
Montevidéu is south of the equator, so it's summer there, winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevidéu has a subtropical climate, with temperatures often exceeding +30 °C in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively bright: temperatures are rarely negative, but wind and humidity make it seem colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is approximately uniform throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park can see humans, the nature is still wild and the animals cannot be fed or disturbed in any way.
As requested by the park administration, keep at least 100 yards away from bears or wolves and 25 yards away from any other wildlife!
Buffalo, owls, bears, and almost any large animal, no matter how friendly it may seem, can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they don't keep the proper distance.
Also, remember that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or preparing smelly food and keep the camp clean.

Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing that he will have a place to stay when he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often have contracts with specific hotels, although you can also book other accommodation, such as camping, through the travel agency.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even a combined flight and hotel package.
They can also book you a place if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (e.g. a visa) needed in the country you are visiting.
Although any changes or requests must first be made to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
In some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to settle on the festival grounds because they consider it an integral part of the festival experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to get a campsite closer to the music.

In countries where taxes are high, people can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The Buffalo-Pittsburgh section of the highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging because it winds through wooded areas.
If you have never driven on the country roads, be on guard: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
The speed limits published are significantly lower than those set out in the previous or subsequent sections  normally 3540 mph (5664 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is even more important.
Strangely, mobile connections here are much stronger than other sections of the road, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are very good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich in taste and variety, similar to those of its southern neighbor Austria.
The usual fruit cakes, which are baked with apple filling all year round, and with cherry and plum filling only in the summer.

The Cochamo Valley is a major mountaineering site in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large granite walls and standing rocks.
From the top, the view is breathtaking, and climbers from all over the world are constantly making new routes because the rocks are endless.
Popular winter downhill sports with slides or snowmobiles attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity, with many skiers, sometimes called 'homeless skiers', planning their entire holiday around skiing in a certain area.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depict skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Austria.
Skiing: This activity is also known as skiing in the outback or ski tourism.
This is related to, but generally does not include, alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being practiced in more rugged terrain and requiring stiffer skis and shoes.
Think of a ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover a little more distance than you would on foot, but you will rarely reach the speed of a flat ski without a heavy backpack on a prepared trail.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it contains many independent countries.Usually, when travelling between countries, you would need to apply for visas several times and stop at border checkpoints for a passport.
However, in this respect the Schengen area operates somewhat like a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you will normally be able to cross the border without having to go through passport control points again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for visas in every Schengen Member State  saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for defining manufactured items as antiques.Some tax authorities define items older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition varies from place to place, for example the age limit in places such as North America may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade articles may be described as antiques, even if they are produced later than similar mass-produced articles.
The reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami, and the trade-related culture is also important for most people in other professions.
Even traditionally, not all were extensively involved in reindeer farming  they lived off fishing, hunting and similar activities, and the deer were mainly used as working animals.
Today, many Sami people are taking up modern professions.
Although the word cig is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misconception of what it is to be Roma.
If a travel warning is issued for the country you are visiting, this may affect your travel medical insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may also want to check the advice of governments in other countries, not just your own, but their advice for their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may face a variety of situations involving Europeans and Arabs.
The advice provides brief information on the political situation in the country.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, general and highly simplified compared to the detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather conditions  is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that may cause damage, disruption of social order or death.
Extreme weather events can be observed worldwide and come in different types depending on geographical, topographical and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, heavy rainfall and fires, as well as hail, hailstorms, floods and cyclones are bad weather and their effects.
The more serious regional and seasonal meteorological phenomena are thunderstorms, winter storms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to investigate any risk of severe weather affecting the area they are visiting, as weather can affect certain travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone must be trained by professionals.
If you search the Internet for "Hostile Environment Courses", you will probably find the address of a local business.
The courses usually cover all the issues discussed in more detail, usually providing practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wild are popular, but few cover war zones.
Travellers planning a sex reassignment surgery should ensure that they have the proper documents to return.

Backflow is the return of waves that break onto the shore, often at reefs and so on.
The underwater topology of the return current concentrates in several deeper places, where it can form a rapidly flowing deep current.
The most common cause of death is exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the flow, it's harder than usual to get back in.
Try to head somewhere where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue.
Re-experiencing shock occurs before culture shock (as if the honeymoon had ended), lasts longer and can be more severe.
