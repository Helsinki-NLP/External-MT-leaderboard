28-year-old man found dead in a store in San Francisco
This week, a 28-year-old coward was found dead in the staircase of a store that recently moved to San Francisco.
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone who would like to hurt over his brother, indicating that: "His life finally began to improve."
The drug, which was found on Wednesday at the Westfield store, was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, said a representative of the San Francisco court medical expertise office.
The San Francisco police said his death was recognized as a murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Luiss Galicia, tells the San Francisco broadcasting station ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked for a pavor in Boston, but six months ago he went to his dream work restaurant "Sons & Daughters" San Francisco.
A representative of the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" reports that the news of his death shocked and shocked them.
"We are a small team working as a joined family and we will miss him very much," the representative said.
In this difficult time we think we’re together with Frank’s friends and family.
Luiss Galicia tells you that at first Frenks had been sleeping in the hostels, but recently life has finally improved.
"He gathered in a new apartment and met a girl," Luiss tells the radio station KGO.
Luiss Galicia says he doesn’t know who would like to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always praised his family, cooking a delicious meal and cooking lunch," said Luiss Galicia
He never wanted to engage in disputes.
He was the one who adapted to the others.
"Given everything that went wrong in the world, he was like an untreated diamond that brilliantly shines every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about the event is invited to call the SFPD Information phone 415-575-4444.
New doctors strike: calls for new protests
Representatives of new doctors call on their trade unions to launch protests in the dispute about the new contract.
The British Medical Association (LMA) New Doctors Committee (JAK) is planning to ask for advice to support the wider protests in early September.
The Ministers have not been able to raise doubts about the agreement.
In July, new doctors and medical students rejected the LMA proposed contract.
58% of all members who participated in the vote voted against the agreement.
In a message posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, YAK council member Elena Makkorta pointed out that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the deal offer has been rejected.
She said: "Given this, the JAK vote resulted in the contract offer was completely rejected and the decision was made to demand new formal discussions to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's silence, JAK today officially requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorize the development of new agreements that would enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, young doctors participated in six strikes, including, for the first time in the history of the NHS, interrupting work.
After a vote rejecting the proposed contractual conditions offered by the LMA, recommended by the BMA, the new representative of the LMA doctors, Dr. Johans Malawana, resigned from the position.
Before meeting with 54 000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer is good and will be accepted.
After the vote, the Secretary of Health, Jeremy Hunt, informed that the contract will be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: a distorted alliance?
A gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shout and announce the end of the eight-month term war and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader at the St. Petersburg Palace, it was the impression that this partnership is more needed for Ankara.
Both are scared.
Vladimir Putin's smile looked concrete and didn't cause warm emotions, even given his apparent abstinence.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Putin at least five times as his "dear friend", a news conference review.
I got a number.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only improve to the pre-crisis level, but will become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper that Erdogan would act as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm causes contradictory feelings.
But the burning cold from Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the crash of a Russian aircraft to the Syrian border.
Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara of inflating a dunch on the back of Moscow.
The transformation was even more painful, given that it came from the friend's side.
To restore true trust will be very difficult, even impossible.
Russia’s position has changed since November.
For several months, a government-controlled television has spread aggressive offenses against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that all were guilty by the Turks.
The most serious was the charges that the Erdogan family had earned profits from illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He himself denied it.
But the main message of the meeting in St. Petersburg is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan.
Russia could see this as a kind of victory.
The benefit of Ankara from the peace agreement is obvious.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month, in which he was attempted to get rid of.
In addition, countless terrorist attacks have scattered his positions.
There are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have caused substantial losses, especially the charter travel prohibition, which generally provides several million Russian tourists every year in the Turkish courts.
The number of tourists decreased by 90%.
Also, Russian tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when regular flights will be restored.
They hope for a holidays hot in the Mediterranean during the season.
This week, the state TV has predicted a decline in the prices of fruits and vegetables, as the imports of fruits and vegetables from Turkey will be restored.
As the local newspaper cites Vedemosti: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
But there were also other political motivations from the Moscow side.
Ankara is angry on the West for, in her opinion, a weak reaction to the coup attempt.
All can also be seen by dissatisfaction with the prolonged negotiations on accession to the EU and Putin’s intervention, which is pleased to take advantage of the situation that Turkey has withdrawn from the West.
The Russian leader has undoubtedly gained additional points in Ankara's eyes, expressing support for its elected government after the coup attempt.
Please note that Moscow understands it well, because it itself has deep rooted fears of regime change in the country.
The summit, which took place in this magnificent submarine castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as it was called by an analyst, the "rejected alliance", the two countries that feel abstained from the West, unite forces.
However, despite the publicly demonstrated unity, there are still significant differences between the two countries.
The main disagreements affect Syria, where Russia presents itself as a carrier of peace, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite parties.
After more than three hours of initial talks, unwilling to disclose information, the two presidents said at a press conference that they did not discuss the issue.
The President of Turkey aimed at avoiding issues concerning disagreements between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasize them.
There is no clear agreement on how the two countries could find a common language on the issue of Syria.
But after months of openly hostile relations and potential disasters, when NATO member Turkey crashed the Russian fighter aircraft, the situation has improved because the two leaders have at least repeated negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The brand will continue to play a support role, the executive director of the bank said.
Outside Scotland SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevans tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the ambitions of the bank globally.
It has abandoned these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost failed and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, brand management strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with the Six Nations Regby and ending with Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But now it is decided to put other national brands in the forefront.
Scottish Royal Banaka will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the main office and the official stock exchange list, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already being used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Now, smaller private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank, will also get in mind.
Makevan was interviewed during the trip with customers and employees through Inverneshire.
He told BBC Scotland Channel: "SKB will become our investor brand and with which our employees work because now we are becoming more a brand bank."
With time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue to sponsor "Six Nations" and will engage various brands in sports sponsorship.
"It's the right time to become a brand bank because we have long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our customers?" says the executive director.
Three years ago it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to our hard work and focusing on the needs of our customers rather than our own needs, we have obviously made great changes.
We can revive these brands again, so I think it’s now the right time.
Frenkie Detori wins the 3000th victory, gaining the first place in New York City with the horse Predilection
The Detori reverses the champagne, winning its 3000. victory twice finishing the first race in New York City.
On Friday, Joker Frenkie Detori won his 3,000th victory in the history of Britain, gaining the first place in New York City.
He achieved it, winning the second victory in these races that took place in his hometown, with Predilection trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Joker who has achieved such a result in the horse sprint races.
He joined Sir Gordon Richard, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Pete Edery and William Karson.
The three-time champion Joker Detori, who previously won with the horse Ghayyar, said: "This is something special."
I am very excited because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket because I have lived here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not the Royal Askot, but the usual Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory, Detori and Predilection are expected with apologies and gauges.
Two Jokers have reached this record in obstacles races - champion Richard Johnson and career-final 20-time champion Sir Anthony McKoy, who set several records in his career, to win more than 4,300 victories.
Lester Pigot, the nine-time derby winner, won 4493 victories during his career.
Frankie is one of the best jokes of today and it is no surprise that he has achieved successes that only rare people can.
He is stylish and powerful, but his tactical feeling distinguishes him from other jokes.
He is a fantastic racing representative, his enthusiasm and harism years attract fans to this kind of sport.
A few weeks ago, in the Epsom races, I told Frenkie that he would have already won 6,000 victories if he didn’t participate only in the weekly finals and the big races.
But seriously, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has been regularly winning in the UK races for 30 years.
He is lively happy, which greatly benefits the British in races, in addition he is an excellent Joker.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his company mark - a flying landing.
From finishing at wind speed to flying landing, Frenkie Detori has been the face of a British horse race for twenty years.
This was a journey full of adventure.
He has won countless major races, including the famous "Great Seven" of 1996 in Askot, and has survived the plane crash and disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago he had difficulty returning after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength of character, challenging those who doubted him, returning to his best form.
And he could participate in the races for a while more - Detori has previously stated that he would like to continue participating in the races at least until the age of 50.
Russian President Putin resigns head of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the head of the administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been Putin’s closest people for many years.
At present, the 63-year-old politician is appointed as a special representative in natural and transport matters.
The Kremlin's statement said that Putin "decised to release Ivanov from the duty of the head of the Russian presidential administration," without any reason.
Ivanov was appointed Antons Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old was a scared diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Embassy of Tokyo.
As the Kremlin’s website reports (in Croatian), he later led the President’s Protocol and the administration of government officials.
After his appointment, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your work as the president of the state, drawing up laws and controlling the execution of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian rail company on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave and recommended Vino as his replacement.
Is the smile convincing?
This is a step towards Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is a sense and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, at the time worked at the Soviet Security Service in the VDK.
In this position he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a meeting broadcast on state television, both men announced that Ivanov would resign from office on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles directed on the cameras, this explanation is rarely convinced, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this a result of the struggle for power?
No one knows it.
But the official claim that a man, who was considered a potential president, suddenly wanted to become the leader of the environmental policy of Russia, is perceived with great skepticism.
In the comments published on the Kremlin website Ivanov says to Putin: "This is the fact that at the beginning of 2012 I ask you to trust me this complicated post, could even say, problematic post, for four years.
It turns out that I have worked in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He was Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former employee of the State Security Service of the VDK, just like Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, Putin led the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the Democratic Republic, Ivanov took over the post of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the presidency of Russia because Putin's re-election to a third term would be unconstitutional.
But then the president became another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the presidency.
Blue appearance of fish in a garden in the city of Banfa
A man from Banfa asks for help to find out the circumstances of what species of fish appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bean believes that 75 fish could be sand cushions that dropped with a steam of water.
Mr. Bean, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a fish video on the Periscope website, hoping that anyone could know how these 5 centimeters big fish came into his garden.
Quinspheria's crossroads: the bridge is now connected to Faif.
Currently, a project worth 1.35 billion pounds is planned to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have connected the northern part of the Queenspher's crossroads with the Viaducte, which means the bridge is now connected to the Faif.
The first of the four connective parts is completed, which means the construction of the bridge is approaching the end.
The construction of the Faifa bridge is 600 meters long and weighs 30 000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
Currently, a project worth 1.35 billion pounds is planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown had arrived today at the building site and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensbury Bridge."
In this project we see an unbeatable engineering solution, where more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel were used in the construction of this part alone.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, the connection of the bridge and the viaducte is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous accuracy.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge layer has already been built and the last stage that will connect the bridge to Rosita will be opened today, meaning that all parts of the bridge are ready to open.
The fourth bridge connection project director Michael Martin tells us: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates the highest-class engineering construction.
After installing the last stage of the road and connecting it with the support of the northern tower, we decided to connect the northern stage of the road with a part of the land, the viadukt.
This was done by placing the northern edge of 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
The huge, as the viaducts are 222 meters long, weigh about 6000 tons and had to pull the slope by about 3%.
Delicate, because the adhesion in both directions with which the team worked was just a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Simone Bailes gets gold in women's exercise.
Forget the tension.
Forget the anxiety.
Simone Bails is not concerned.
The dynamic jump.
Without effort perform exercises on the balcony.
Impossible on the floor.
It is completely innocent.
And finally the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American worker won the gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic scene.
Her total number of points was 62,198 over the result of the silver medal winner and her team member Aliya Raisman and bronze medal winner Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina.
On Thursday, U.S. athlete Simona Bails performed a ball sports exercise in the individual multi-match final for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bailes became the fourth American woman in a row to win the multi-match championship title and the fifth best trainer, gradually strengthening her reputation as the best trainer of her generation and possibly the best trainer in history.
When the final result was announced, she drove out in tears because the long way to this moment was over.
This achievement brings them next to the unbeatable athletes like Michael Felps, who raised his sport to another level.
In the last three years, Bailes has dominated his sporting form, winning 15 medals in the world championships, including 10 gold medals, performing such excellent, accurate and ambitious combinations of exercises that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lu Retone called him "the best trainer she's ever seen."
In Brazil, he was awaited by the last test, where she had to greatly match with the hopes placed on him, not with the other athletes.
She would be disappointed if I returned to my home in Spring, Texas without gold medals.
U.S. athletes Simona Bailsa (left) and Aliya Raismane are discouraged after winning gold and silver medals in the individual multi-match final for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal was won by Bailsa on Tuesday, making a special selection co-ordinator Martas Karolji greeting party.
Although Bailsa claims that he did not expect anything like that in his long journey to the famous heights, it is not true.
Part of her presence in free movements, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which will perfectly fit on the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is not a coincidence.
The girl adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby and discovered by the mother of coach Eimya Burman on a tour to the sports hall where Burman's thorns took place, has now become a force to count on.
She has not lost multiple races since the summer of 2013 and the winning series can continue as long as Bailsa wants it.
Although Mustafina made a little out in the leadership during the two rotates, it was just an illusion.
The balance balcony and free movement - the part of the competition where Bailsa will defend his champion title is still just ahead.
He set out in the forefront with a result of 15,433 on the ball and strengthened leadership with a result of 15,933 free movements.
Raismane kissed him gently while she waited for results that were just formality and she flown joy in tears when the dream that she once had recorded in her notebook was fulfilled.
Raisman's result was like a small revenge for four-year-old events when she shared a third place with Mustafin, but lost the struggle for a bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which Americans call "the grandmother", was placed in a convincing lead.
After the outcome in the free movements, which cried doubts about her return, she was able to dedicate an air kiss to the effort.
Meanwhile, the 19 year old Feil's viral Twitter record r, which she posted this week, now has a completely different meaning.
The six-year-old Mahai Brown, a "loze shattered" man, survives in a fire in Philadelphia.
The police that the six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, indicating that he is already the second six-year-old boy to be shot this week in Philadelphia.
The child's parents confirmed to the CBS Philadelphia News Channel that it was Mahai Brown.
Parents say Braun was shot several times, including in the circle, foot, hand and abdomen, but he was still in mind when he was taken to the hospital.
Her grandmother, Delores Melendez, tells a television story: "His small body was simply shrinked."
I can’t believe it.
The boy in a critical condition has been hospitalized and has already suffered several operations.
The family informs that he will surely recover.
He had to begin to go to the first class in the local primary school.
Braun is one of the four people killed in a part of the city of Germantown.
Three men were also arrested: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
Channel CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the remaining two victims are in stable condition.
The channel reports that the child was found in the front seat next to the 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The remaining two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether one of them was the attacker.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that several shooters were likely involved in the shooting.
In the place of the incident, weapons patterns, which belong to various weapons, were found.
It seems to have been a long-term shooting.
Both sides of the passengers were found.
"It appears that there were several armed shooters who were actively involved in the shooting," said Philadelphia police captain Antonio Ginaldi.
The damage also occurred in several homes and cars.
No one has yet been arrested and it is that the police are checking the recordings of the surveillance cameras.
On Tuesday, during the shooting, a frozen boat caught a six-year-old girl in the hand while she was playing in front of her house in the Vestoukleine district.
She is slowly recovering, but the police are still searching for the guilty.
Why do we need Simon, Gabi and Laurie?
I call it the Year's Women's Olympic Lightning Team for a number of reasons.
First, I have been on all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been so good.
Second, in this team there are three lightweight girls, Simon Bails, Gabi Duglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are inspired by many young girls.
People can be proud that this team includes Aliya Raismane, a Jew, and Medisona Kociana, a Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
In the last four years, the best practitioner is an African American.
Last year, Simon and Gabi occupied the 1st and 2nd places.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympics, Gabija Duglas was surprised to become the Olympic champion, and America was able to lyx.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises performed by the three-time world champions Simon Bails, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, doing unprecedented but mastery exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American woman in a row who won the gold medal in the individual multi-war for women.
Her teammate Aliya Raismane won the silver medal.
We’ve seen the best this sport can give, but in the rest of the country the situation in the exercise hours is completely different.
Simone, Gabi and Laurie entered the Olympic class like Ali and Medison.
They are the "Olympic Fifth" because there will be only four athletes in the next Olympic exercise team, and this is the last year of coach Martha Carol's trainer's work.
Exercises are mainly trained in private lightweight clubs, and they areined by parents who pay for training, rooms, trips, fashion clothes, hotels (trainer, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these lightweight clubs are located in such urban districts that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes take all their training, and this is a expensive and long-term contribution to lightweight families.
Amy Burman - Simon Bail's coach and Megi Haini - Laurie Hernandez's coach have trained their athletes since the two girls started working with lightweight.
We need to provide young girls inspired by Simon, Gabi and Laurie with cheaper exercise opportunities.
I founded my lightweight organization 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Spanish) exercise training free of charge or at a low price.
In September we will open a branch in Detroit (my hometown) to provide local young people with the opportunity to get acquainted with this great sport.
The lightweight develops strength, locancy and body coordination, as well as teaches hard work, discipline and approach to the goal.
This combination provides a long life with good health and success in both school and work.
This team will inspire thousands of new girls to train in lightweight and it’s fantastic.
Treating this type of sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Ali, Gabi and Medison for the great demonstration of the "Girl Power", winning Olympic gold medals and motivating countless new, different girls to become healthy, strong and successful new women.
After the rejection of Jeremy Hunt’s offer, the new doctors plan to launch more strikes.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on the amendments to the agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association. but it was rejected by 58 percent of the 37 000 new doctors who participated in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to conclude a contract, pointing out that NHS is in an unstable state and further delays will only harm employees and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract that provides for changes in the conditions of work in night changes and weekends to improve the working conditions in non-standard working hours.
Yesterday evening BMA's new doctors representative Dr. Elena Makourta announced that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will deepen the labour crisis and it does not provide all doctors with equal conditions.
The remaining eight weeks until the first group of new doctors will sign a new contract, so it is necessary to make progress because the time has not left a lot.
The efforts of the BMA to solve the problem through negotiations have faced with the government’s refusal to engage and sometimes with complete silence.
This happened despite the fact that even last month, Jeremy Hunt stated that his doors were always open.
Jeremy Hunt has to act immediately, stop the inactivity and cooperate with new doctors.
If he does not do so, then the new doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed at the end of April, while mothers and consultants tried to replace the doctors who had taken the picet.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on the amendments to the agreement with the representatives of the British Medical Association.
The BMA plans to raise the work rate for the weekends for 54 000 new doctors to be covered by the new contracts.
NHS Employment Executive Director Daniel Mortimers called on new doctors not to go on strike.
Mr. Mortimer explains that the strikes do not solve anything, but only raise pressure on deceased employees and worry, causing stress and disturbances to patients, caregivers and their families.
Over the past two months we have talked with the new committee of doctors and together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions we have responded positively to their questions about caregivers and reporters.
Employers hope that active cooperation in other important matters such as employee displacement, flexible training, in addition to training for those who return after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programs, study failure and gender pay inequality in medicine - indicate that employers, the English health education institutions and the Ministry of Health seriously want to implement agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
The drug for 2 pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients with a heart attack could be treated with drugs for 2 pounds a day, as official representatives recommend taking them for more people and for a longer period of time.
The contraceptive drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurring heart attack in people with heart disease.
This drug is already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of recurring heart attack.
NHS represented NICE recommends taking this preparation 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of a heart attack in people with heart and vascular problems.
However, NICE, which is currently in charge of NHS, recommends taking this preparation 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart and blood vessels.
Every year, about 140,000 people in England suffer from a heart attack and a quarter of them suffer from a repeated heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat in the walls of the heart, forming constipations.
If the constipation flows, it can create a trombus, blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
In turn, if the thromb is separated from the vascular wall, it can go further into the bloodstream and block the blood access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at a higher risk of recurring heart attack.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the UK firm AstraZeneca and traded under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of forming trompet.
The new NICE guidelines, which were published today, recommends people taking 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years by 60 mg twice a day along with aspirin.
NICE Health Technology Director Professor Kerola Longson explains: “Though there are medications available to prevent recurring heart attack, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, which often has severe consequences.”
Fear of recurring heart attack can leave a negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Evidence shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of recurring heart attack and heart attack in people who have once experienced it.
By provisionally recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we can extend the treatment possibilities to thousands of people who are thus winners.
Given the limited information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor, especially the risk of bleeding, when using this drug for more than three years, the guidelines project does not recommend it to be used for longer than this period.
The culture of political correctness promotes voting fraud in Muslim communities
According to the management report, former mayor of Tauerhamlet, Lutfur Rahman, was released from office in connection with corruption.
The government’s report reveals that the result of political correctness is the eye to widespread fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickle criticizes the police, election supervisors and city councils that they ignore the signs of fraud in the election process because of "he's afraid to disrupt ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become the leader of an anti-corruption organization, says that the oppression of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should be allowed to place guards at the election stations to protect the oppressed voters.
He also recommends that voters should present a person-proof document when they vote to prove their true identity.
Voters must only indicate their name and address.
He even recommends to mark the voter's fingers with a special tint to prevent double voting.
Reporters should also provide greater protection, says Sir Eric.
He believes that the press should have greater access to the Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The goal is not only to prevent voting fraud, but also to protect local governments from wider corruption and fraud culture that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was ordered by Dauningstrit after a scandal related to the city elections in Tauerhamlet.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided to withdraw Luthfur Rahman from the office due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman “cynically ruined” his Muslim community’s religious view and obsessed his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign with the point of view that the religious duty of faithful Muslims is to vote for him."
About 300 votes were false or doubtful because one person had voted several times.
Sir Eric also points out that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that it was worrying the fraud in voting by mail, where the elderly members of the Muslim communities forced others to vote for the candidates they wanted.
Sir Eric recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a person-proof document to identify a person.
His report reports: "Proofs show that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote for the elected candidates of the community, especially in Bangladesh and Pakistan communities."
"There are concerns that the regional institutions will not pay attention to these issues due to political correctness, as it could harm ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Eric presented 50 recommendations to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists to act with votes transmitted by mail to prevent "vote collection".
The report, which is reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for a more thorough registration check to prevent the use of voter lists for fraud in the field of immigration and benefits.
Consider the possibility to ask voters to present a person-proof document before voting.
Mark the voter's fingers with a special tint to prevent double voting.
Systematically check the nationality of persons to make sure that the person has the right to vote.
Establish a three-year limit for requests for automatic voting by mail.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from working with votes passed by post and voting by post in electoral circles.
To ensure that the police are empowered to deploy guards at the electoral locations.
To make changes to the law to facilitate the appeal of persons to responsibility for intimidation under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
It is forbidden to photograph in the electoral districts.
Establish the requirements in the electoral sections to use only the English language (except in Wales).
Strengthening the training so that the board staff ensure that the voters go to the election urns by one.
Sir Eric sharply criticizes the Metropolitan police, expressing misunderstanding that there are no accusations in the Tauerhamlet case.
He tells us: "The election court only disqualified Lufturu Rahman and his representative for actions associated with corruption and fraud."
He was convincingly convicted of guilty according to the criminal law evidence standard, based on irrevocable evidence.
He also criticizes the ineffective "check check" of the city's voters in the voter registration sections.
Sir Eric points out: “The court’s decision last year is an alarm call.
Our country is known as the Parliament's homeland, but an alarming and hidden election of the spread of fraud and the institution's disclosure that the fraud does not occur threatens this good reputation.

The CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer has 'finished like a pig'.
The analysis of Bairon McDonald's of the 14-year-old Ai Yanha finish fourth place in the 4x200 m free-style stafet for women, led to a storm of shooting in the CBC viewers.
Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologize because one of its commentators commented that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer from the competition had "leaped out of the competition that forgot alone" and "finished like a pig."
The commenter, Bairon McDonald, thought his microphone was turned off when the 4x200 m free-style women's staples at the end of the final explained their personal opinion.
McDonald, who was included in the CBC commentary team to give the comments vitality, said: "This little fourteen-year-old from China can't keep it with."
"From the end, she fled out of the competition, that she forgot alone and ended like a pig."
A lot of thanks!
The 14 year old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana's result in the second stage was 1:57.79, which is 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Teilores Ruck's result, allowing the Canadians to reach China.
The viewers across Canada immediately reacted on the internet because they were shocked by hearing such tones and expressions.
Emet McFarlane wrote on Twitter: "Is the CBC commentator just said that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "accepted like a pig"????".
The idiot did not realize that they were still in the straight ether.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m free style final for women was named "a small fourteen-year-old from China who doesn't go with."
The criticism of Bairon McDonald quickly came into force, as many asked for explanations.
Twitter users were unable to believe when he heard the unpleasant comments of Bairon McDonald.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: “Oh, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and because of you we all sound like racists.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who then led the CBC live broadcast, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying: "We apologize for the comment on the swimming result scattered in the direct ether."
It was a failed choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded to Twitter to this comment.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize in his place.
The CBC then apologized to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and an announcement.
We are very sorry that such comments were expressed and they came into the direct ether.
Yesterday we immediately responded and apologized to all live broadcast viewers and followers on social media.
For clarity, it should be said that Bairon's comments were expressed about the performance of the swimmer, not addressed to her personally.
But they were in any case unprofessional and unsuccessfully selected statements and Bairon very regret what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized in the direct ether and tried to explain that he did not think his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
On the CBC Olympics live broadcast he said: "I would like to take the moment and apologize for the comment I expressed yesterday after the women's free style competition."
I’m talking about the performance of the swimmer, not about him personally.
I have to say that I didn’t intend to show disappointment and I really regret that it happened.
Primark buyers are shocked by a woman who is unhappyly hanging in the middle of the underwear store.
Buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman began to dress up to lay pants in the middle of the store.
Even more worsening the situation, she applied them to make sure they were attached to her and then wrapped, putting the pants back on the store plate.
She continued to look for clothes at the shop in Folkeston's Bouverie Place and applied four more pants.
Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkeston – the place where this woman laid the underwear and then laid it back on the plate.
At the time in the store was also the mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who tells the story that an unknown woman pulled her clothes and left the store without buying anything.
She indicates that people could not believe their eyes.
Staying in the middle of the store, she took the underwear from the plate, dropped her socks and pants and still put them on the place.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place to put them on, she simply put them on the place.
Everyone looked at her towing pants and obviously the woman didn’t like them because she just put them back on the plate.
She wrapped another three pants until she decided that she didn’t like any of them and left the store.
It didn’t seem that she was worried about someone looking at or thinking about a man who would buy the clothes she wrapped.
Davidson's young girl (33 years old) from Kent tells the story: "There's a terrible thought that someone will buy clothes that have been drawn by another man and that are not then wiped out."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson's new cousin adds: "I assume that the store employees after her departure took the said clothes out of the store plates - which is also acceptable."
I can’t imagine I could buy a new underwear and find out that another woman has wrapped them and then they’re not washed out.
Primark representative said that Primark is known for the incident that took place on Tuesday, August 9.
Specific clothes are removed from the plate of the store.
How to Protect Yourself From Shooting Weapons With Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect yourself at a close distance from the attackers with a firearm, we talked with Krav Maga Grand Champion from New York Ron Mizraki.
Regardless of whether you are attacked from the front or back, this video shows how to protect yourself and get superiority over the attacker.
Mizraaki indicates that if the attacker attacks from the back, then first you need to turn to clearly see the attacker and avoid the shooting trajectory.
Then the weapon must catch between your front hand and shoulder and make a hit in the face of the opponent with your free elcon.
Then follow a strike with a cylinder on the circle and as long as the attacker is confronted with pain, he must take his weapons, go on the face with a spell of weapons and go away, continuing to target the weapon against him.
If the attacker approaches from the front, the situation is similar - to avoid the shooting trajectory, to shut down the weapon and to shut it so that the malicious cannot shoot out.
At the same time, you have to make pressure on the weapon and make a blow to the opponent on the chest and finally take him the weapon and take away continuing to theme on him.
It sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see how exactly Mizraki does it.
But remember, if you’re not the Krav Maga master, then it’s safer to return your money to the thief.
The Vandal family demolishes the social house of Saltas Cornwall and is thrown on the street.
The Vandal family has been dismissed from the residence for terrorism of neighbors, causing damage to the social house of 50,000 pounds.
Tanja Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilkock were evacuated from the property in Salt Cornville because of several complaints.
When they were forced to be removed from the property, the shocked residential service representatives found that the property was completely demolished.
The roofs and the walls were shrinked, the waste was shrinked everywhere, and the walls were shrinked with graphite.
The family is now out of property and is most likely to live in some private property.
Donna Makeva, Managing Director of the Cornwall Housing Service, says there is concern that the housing will not be possible to restore.
She tells me that people who lived here were extremely difficult and she believes people can’t live like that.
In this case, several factors should be assessed, as in the future this property in Cornwall will not have a good reputation.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who periodically stayed in the property and the police say their terror was manifested as violence, climbing to the streets with baseball nodes, intimidating local residents, drug use, drug sale, and noise blurring and lacking.
The 47-year-old Skeldone, whose name was owned, was sentenced in June for anti-social behavior.
There were a lot of waste found in the houses.
In the house, where it is possible to trade drugs in advance, several floors are also drawn out.
Neighbors say they regularly climbed to the street and were constantly called the police.
The Cornwall Household Service released them from the property in a compulsory order when they had been given 11 weeks to voluntarily leave the house.
The ridiculous neighbors were very happy about the exile, because their life had been an absolute hole.
One said, “They did not take care of the other people.”
We have lived with them for 20 years, it has always been crazy.
It is unbelievable how often we have seen the police here.
I couldn’t walk this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we are not accustomed to it!
Now that they’re finally away, here will be wonderful.
Adams Fitzpatriks, who is the head of neighbourhood protection of the Cornwall Household Service, said the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family lived here for 20 years and here regularly called the police.
A variety of old and useless items were found in the grown garden of the house.
He also stated: "It's very sorry that the rents did not show any responsibility for their behavior, because leaving the house is always the last step that the Cornwall Household Service considers."
This was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and the neighbors had been very difficult to neglect their behavior.
I appreciated the work that my entire team, the police of Devon and Cornwall and members of the municipality invested in this case, who were courageous and worked with us to provide the necessary information.
I hope this event will make the lives of neighbors easier and show that anti-social behavior is unacceptable.
Fitzpatriks said that all three sons here had lived in different periods of time, but all were about 20 years old.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after placing.
Service workers will now have to remove the waste tank left in the house.
In 2014, the police carried out the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, pounds, accessories and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldone is only guilty of storing class B drugs for the purpose of spreading them.
She claimed that the money was intended to remind her son Lee Sheldon who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the release it became known that they are currently renting some private property in Plimut.
On many walls of the house were labelled graphites.
Police say they will continue to locate rents that violate their rental contracts.
The police representative of Devon and Cornwall, Angela Krova, points out that this dismissal is an obvious warning to other rents who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning for those who believe that they can behave as they want and will not have any consequences."
The police of Devon and Kronvol is unacceptable for criminal and anti-social behavior, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
The willingness to spend can give an impulse to the economy.

The Cannes Mayor has banned burkini swimming in the beaches.
The city's southern resort, Cannes, has banned the city's beaches from wearing burkini swimming costumes, which almost completely embrace the woman's body and very reminds of a hydrocarbon, local officials said on Thursday.
Cannes Mayor David Linar has signed an order that "the access to the beaches and swimming is prohibited to anyone who has no swimming clothes that respect good patterns and secularism" as the fundamental principle of the French Republic.
"The clothes of the crowd, which clearly demonstrate religious belief in the time when France and the cult sites are the target of terrorist attacks, can pose a risk of public order disruption (rise, collision, etc.) that needs to be avoided," the order said.
“We’re talking not about the ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about the aristocratic clothes associated with the trust of the terrorist movements that fight with us,” said Tjery Migul, head of municipal services.
He added that the burkini swimming clothes on the Cannes beaches have not been seen since 28 July, when a member of the right-wing central party "Republicans" Linar signed this order and it came into force.
This week, the aquapark in the city of Marseille has revoked the planned private event for Muslim women who would be dressed in a burkini in the swimming pools, as the suspicion for such an event was expressed by both right and left-wing politicians.
In France, it is forbidden to wear face-looking Muslim women's headsets, but religious symbols or related clothes are not forbidden.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack committed by the Islamic State in Nice, near Cannes.
On 26 July, two terrorists who had sworn their trust in the Islamic State brutally killed priests in a church in northwestern France.

The festival “Cuban” begins in Lucavsal.
On Thursday, 11 August, the evening in Lucavsal was given the start of one of the last festivals of this summer - there until Sunday night will be "Cuban".
The first evening meetings were luteated by groups such as "Enter Shikari" from the UK, which was expected last year but missing from the program, American banks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
Also in the next days of the festival in the program are the words worthy of insight - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", the pancreatic legend "Ramones" bondsman Markie Ramon with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with the White Croatian pancreatic leader Sergei Mihaloku in front, popular Georgian actor and singer Vahtangs Kikabidze, Ukrainians "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a number of other but full event programs can be viewed here.
This is the second year the festival "Kubana" takes place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered financial failure and enormous losses, but it did not stop the organizers from repeated attempt - they added longsigns to the name, included some Latvian group in the program (Friday evening 19:15 on the stage "All Day Long") and announced that now the festival has become "thicker and gained the local colorite alongside such Riga symbols as its panorama and cats."
Whether these efforts will be justified, even early to judge, because the festival just stumbled, but, as the first evening observed by "Delfi Entertainment", at least for now the enormous efforts of people to attract did not succeed and the number of visitors was similar to last year.
The British squad twice boosted the Olympic record and won the sprint.
The British track team on Thursday twice fixed the Olympic record and won the sprint in men's competitions.
The first Olympic record was fixed by the British in the qualification, but the first round of the competition was again fixed by the New Zealand.
In the Sprint final, the British team met New Zealand, and the British took the New Zealand Olympic record holders title, leaving them with silver medals.
In the final, the UK team won with a score of 42,440 seconds, overcoming the New Zealand by 0.102 seconds.
In the battle for the bronze, the French team defeated Australia.
It should be added that the record was also corrected in the women's racing race qualification - the UK team corrected the world record, which is now 4:13.260.
The President who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
On Friday, August 12, it was 145 years since the birth of the second President of Latvia, Gustave Zemgal.
Zemgals proclaimed the state of Latvia, but unprofitable has remained in the shadow of the widely described first President of Latvia, Jan Čakstes, and the last President of the preliminary period, Karl Ulman.
None of our state men have so much defended democracy and the rule of law as Zemgals, in a book dedicated to Gustav Zemgals published ten years ago by Arnold Auziņš.
In a conversation with the portal "Delfi" Auziņš emphasizes that Zemgals is one of the few high-level politicians who had a sense of humor.
The rest of these kinds, always very right.
He taught that not to be, today it might be the same as Raymond Vyanis.
“He was the one who was close to the people,” he says.
Modern politicians badly know history, they refer to Karl Ulman as a good leader, but rarely who knows how negative he was.
The only person in the government seats to whom he did not cry was General Balodis.
Even if in the pictures he is kind and smiling, by nature he was hysterical.
“Zemgals with their sense of humor and democracy leave the opposite impression,” says Auziņš.
Professor Aivar Stranga of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia in a conversation with "Delfi" agrees to Auzi's assessment of Zemgalu as a peaceful and open state man.
He also notes that Zemgals argued with respect to the minorities, regularly invited Jewish representatives to the president's castle.
"At that time it wasn't a normal action, after the President of Zemgala, Albert Kvies took over this tradition," the historian tells.
He was such a quiet and open man who had to become a president for a long time.
He does not do it, he does not do it, he does not do it.
He also criticized himself quite critically because he didn’t know the French language, but believed that the president should definitely understand it.
“In the presidential period the foundations of the French language were both learned,” Stranga explains.
The underground was not allowed to be used again, he didn’t like such high positions.
In any case, he is a very respected person in the history of Latvia, already before he arrived in the president's palace he was in a serious position - he was a very demanding notary.
Also, Zemgals led the famous Zemgala kas in Suvorova Street 3, where a company of warehouses and warehouses was found, in which practically the government negotiations hit the state of Latvia.
He was always progressive.
There was no big fan of Ulman, but publicly he did not respond.
“In private talks, many times there are statements that the real actions of Ulman are not sympathic to him,” Stranga says.
He lived a peaceful life, there was no suspicion of irregularities or corruption.
How do you remember this day?
Unfortunately, much of it is associated with some of the streets of Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, his opinions were central.
"There was no big trouble during her time, that is, he could associate with such a truly stable presidency," Stranga summarizes.
During the presidency of Gustav Zemgala, from 1927 to 1930, a visit of the State of Latvia to Sweden also took place, which indirectly signified for Latvia the full recognition in the neighboring country and the inclusion in the House of Democratic Nations of Northern Europe.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgals arrived at a national visit to Stockholm.
The Swedish King Gustave V's response visit to Latvia took place on June 29, 1929.
The second president of Latvia was born in 1871, but left forever in January 1939.
Simple ways to help a child cope with anger attacks.
I often have to face the fact that the appearance of child's anger, nickness parents consider something wrong and abnormal.
When a child openly shows his anger - we don't know how to react, "Econet" indicates the psychologist Jekaterin Kesa.
The specialist encourages a small conversation about these so natural and human feelings - anger and nickness that each periodically experiences.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity addressed to another person, and it usually occurs when we feel angry.
When we, adults, are angry, angry - we usually know what happens to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and anger in ourselves: to express, to suppress, to hide, to keep in ourselves, to tell our friends or other neighbors about it, we can break the sofa in anger, to smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to clam the anger!), go to the shower, go with a bull on the table and do other things we don’t usually do.
We do not deal our aggression with others because we know different ways to cope with these emotions.
When children are angry, they don’t understand what’s happening to them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say, “Go away!”, “You’re a fool,” “The bad mom,” “I’m not going to see you,” “I’m not going to deal with you,” and very rarely when they can say, “I’m angry on you.”
Children live in the literal sense, they are completely right here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and genuine in the expression of their feelings, and often are also in the hostage of different emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prevent the child from showing feelings, including anger, do not speak about it and do not, but on the contrary - to help the child.
Does the relationship need a break?
A day of work in the mind, in which everything has not gone as you would like, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you would like to "close" from the whole world for a moment, day or even longer.
Is it possible to break up the relationship for a while and breathe a little?
Does this also indicate that each of the partners is on their own path?
They share their opinions in different ages.
John (23) is short and core: "In my opinion, if a relationship requires a break, then you are not with a real person."
Meanwhile, Eduard (30) has discovered a scheme that is likely to help someone.
If you feel that your partner begins to get nervous for every little bit, then definitely - this is the right time to explore other hunting fields to understand if you miss him, or especially he doesn't think about him or even doesn't want to see him anymore.
So the answer is - yes, staying a break can help save time and understand how important the other side is to you.
Casparus (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, relationships should be a break between each other on a daily basis, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you get off every little thing the other does, and it begins to fall into the nerves.
People begin to cheat each other, especially when you don’t have anything to talk about, just about what you’ve done on a day.
My personal experience causes me to think that, so I have not been in a relationship for more than a couple of months.
If you think for a moment that elsewhere or elsewhere it’s better – then why has this woman you’re with deserved one who can think that there’s not good enough here and there’s paradise fields behind the mountains?
Thinking is a little betrayal.
If not, then there is no.
“I have, so I condemn a little for those who do not have,” says Edmund (46).
Karl (33) has a completely opposite view.
Everyone needs a moment to relax.
You can’t look at each other in the eyes every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, and cry for untouchable love.
Go out!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everything has its time.
Of course, also for a girlfriend or wife, however, if both know how to maintain their balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live to the edge of the tomb.
That and just that.
Martyn (27) says so: “It’s hard to say – need or don’t need, can or can’t take a break, but one is clear – the proposer has something in the relationship to the end, something is missing.”
If this question arises, then it is necessary to calculate that there will be any changes in the near future - on the right or the bad side, it depends on itself.
I think, as long as you are still new and crazy, the rest needs - something all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship enters a completely different phase, then there cannot be no talk about rest.
You decide to spend your whole life together.
"If you can't deal with each other's society now and you need a rest once in a time, then what will happen when you're a retireer who comment on how missing cats are hungry or disputes about which day the garden should be better to ride," says Kristaps (19).
All the words have changed.
With his exciting and exciting personality, Rosenthal first modested the interest of the Latvian people in the painting arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain unforgettable forever," so about the Latvian painter Jani Rozenthal at the time wrote Romans Suta.

The backgrounds of the U.S. model business in his interpretation gained the glimpse of perversial exquisite photographs and the impatience of the horror film.
In essence - a very provocative, balancing work of excellence and banal vulgarity, in which it is difficult to fix the boundaries between the European art house film and the Hollywood genre product territory.
The film with Vigo Mortensen in the main role emphasizes the question whether parents' conceptually chosen lifestyle patterns (ecologicality, vegetarianism, alternativeism and elimination from consumer society's stupidity and values) bring blessing or destructive to their children.
The idealist father of six children after his wife's death faces questions about the correctness of choices and real values.
The exciting, lifelong film, the author of which Mets Ross this year won the Cannes Festival Award for Director.
Of course, the horse does it just as an attack on the thick mothers - in the Jewelry it was a swimmer, in this case - a brave surfist, brought back by Bleika Laivlia.
The work demanded her thorough heroism.
This survival solony can be compared to James Franco's performance show in the 127 Hours film and Ryan Reynolds's game in the Film Description Live.
Probably the guilt is also the main role of the filmmaker Mila Kunis, whose transformations from the grandmother to the creative survivor and the family’s values are only thought to be created by the fantasies of all the misleading Hollywood scenarios.
The Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
The terrorist group Islamic State fighters, fleeing from Mumbai, Syria's Aleppo province, kidnapped about 2,000 civilians, used as a living shield, the U.S.-backed Kurdish and Arab alliance and observers said on Friday.
“We don’t shoot them because they fled to Jerusalem and took civilians with them,” a spokesman for the Kurdish Military Council of Mumbai said.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), which is a U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, announced Friday that Mumbai was released from the jihadists.
The Islamic State occupied Mumbai in 2014.
The QSD already last week killed the majority of the "Islamic State" fighters from Mumbai, but some held up and showed strong resistance.
However, on Friday they left the city, bringing themselves with the kidnappers.
Islamists go to Jerusalem, which is located on the border with Turkey.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) has also that the Islamic State has kidnapped about 2,000 people.
The SOHR that the Islamists stolen the cars of the city, forcing people to gather in them, and then brought them to Jerusalem.
The Islamic State fighters have also previously committed mass kidnapping.
In January, Islamists captured territories in the province of Deir ez-Zora in eastern Syria, kidnapping more than 400 civilians, including women and children.
The Islamists released about 270 of the prisoners.
How many Islamic State fighters have escaped from Mumbai is unknown.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Military Council of Mumbai that the QSD managed to rescue 2500 people detained by Islamists in Mumbai.
The information collected by the SOHR shows that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, were killed in the fight for the Mumbai.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists were killed.
Kohlegova will refuse to be a candidate for the leadership of the VID.
The head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Koļegova, has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the agency LETA informed the Ministry of Finance.
Coalegova points out that her candidacy talks have raised contradictions among the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussions are related to the politicians’ visible, but more often, invisible interests, and they have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional abilities.
“It’s not acceptable for me,” he emphasizes that he has already been a candidate for the leadership position.
In the event that her candidacy would be approved in the government, it is clear that it would not be a convincing vote and it would not allow full work and realization of the necessary changes in the VID, feeling all government support.
Without this, full work would not be possible, concludes Koļegova.
“Sometimes I have publicly emphasized that I don’t want to be politically dependent, but at the moment all my candidacy process is too politized,” the official explains.
“Thank you for the trust and support I have shown, this is an experience I have valued as a benefit,” Koļegova writes in a statement to Reizniece-Ozola.
The unity said on Wednesday that during the meeting with Kolegov there was a "important contradiction" between the explanations of the candidate and the information available in the public registers on the costs of the Pallogs dividends, as the publicly available decisions of the meetings of the Pallogs members predict not to share the profits.
Currently, the head of the VID is performed by Deputy Director-General Dace Pelek.
In Lithuania, the police are involved in the rescue of two children left without supervision, the state police department of the Latgales region reports.
The report on uncontrolled wheels with babies was received on Friday at 7 p.m.
They were found in Leuven near the former store building.
The two young girls were immediately transferred to the doctors for assistance.
There was also a bag with documents and a mobile phone.
In less than half an hour, the lawmakers discovered the possible location of the parents of the children and went on.
When the woman arrived in the house of a civilian, the police found that the woman was sleeping because of a strong alcohol.
According to the initial information of the previous day in the evening of the year 1992, a woman born in the village of a girlfriend, where she was drinking alcohol.
After going home after a joint session, the woman decided to leave the children at the store in unclear circumstances.
The police immediately informed the court, which will also decide the fate of the child.
The Riga Free Station has introduced all the recommendations of the UK regarding the Russian island project.
The Riga Resort Administration has introduced all of the five recommendations of the State Control (VK) regarding the project Infrastructure Development on the Russian island for the implementation of port activities from the city center, the portal Diena.lv informed the company.
The approval of the project is planned at the nearest meeting of the Riga Free Board.
In order for the recommendations to be introduced in accordance with the opinion of the VK, preparing the necessary documentation for the implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Freedom Board was also guided by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit conducted by the international auditor Deloitte Riga Freedom Board and the recommendations given to improve the management of the project in the future stage of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations today has also been sent to the VK.
Despite the fact that the Riga Resort Administration does not agree with the opinion prepared by the United Nations on the usefulness of the implementation of the Russian Island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the funding provider - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to emphasize that all the construction work planned in the framework of the project is fully completed within the scheduled deadlines and in the planned amount.
"To prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the European Commission, the United Kingdom and the guides that the main objective of the resort is to successfully implement the project, we have fully introduced all the recommendations of the United Kingdom regarding the issues of project management and monitoring," said the project manager of the Russian island, Sanita Kaire.
For the purpose of monitoring and monitoring of the project’s objective, the long-term action plan was supplemented with the main planned actions of the stakeholders and the necessary deadlines for decision-making, the definitions and deadlines of meetings and regular interruptions, the instruments for monitoring the planned construction process, as well as the definitions of the most important boundaries.
The approved plan of action for the achievement of the project’s objective until 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the VK, is supplemented with the performance monitoring activities, thus strengthening the control of the deadlines of the activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project from the Riga Freedom Party.
In order to improve project management and to reduce potential risks, a project management plan has been redesigned, defining the fields of project management and indicating the prepared documents that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
To increase the project capacity, a project management structure scheme has been developed, which reflects the structure of the project management team, the qualifications and functions of the staff.
In order to improve communication with the parties involved in the project, a communication plan for the parties involved in the project has been developed, which in addition to the parties specified in the project action plan, defines the parties involved in the project for the successful completion, the principles of information exchange, types and periodicity.
In turn, in order to improve the control of the use of funds, the need for a service contract or procurement will be further detailed, and the rule of law.
In the framework of the project, a port infrastructure in accordance with the world standards has been built on the Russian island - four new deepwater ports, railway ports, and engineering communications.
The co-financed buildings have been completed and put into operation in the end of the year, achieving a savings of €10.6 million.

The meeting will discuss the consequences of the Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without the UK.
Slovakia will be the president of the EU until January.
German researchers discuss the number of "Berlin Wall victims".
According to a new study, the number of deaths near the communist coast of the former eastern Germany border could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the real number of victims are still unleashed.
According to data released on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, during the period from 1945 to 1989, at the border with the western Allied Zones and the latter Western Communist authorities murdered 1841 people trying to get out of their controlled territory.
The museum has been investigating the deaths related to the border for years and is improving the number of victims.
This year, 11 more deaths were added to the list, including a six-year-old boy who disappeared in an attempt to get to the West Germany through Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the young victims of the Berlin Wall are Soviet army desserters.
“The final amount of damage caused by the double harm of communism and socialism is not yet fully documented,” said Alexander Hildebrante, director of the museum.
"Our task is to ensure that the tombs of the people who died trying to escape from a communist-controlled country are gathered and not destroyed," Hildebrantes said in a statement.
But other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The number of 1841 is uncertainty," in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung, says John State, an expert in Eastern Germany history at the Free University of Berlin.
He, along with other researchers at the Berlin Free University, is currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border, and so far they have managed to confirm only 260 cases.
Earlier, researchers estimated that only near the Berlin Wall Communists killed 138 people.
Given those people who died trying to escape through the Baltic Sea or get to the West through neighboring territories, according to the State, the number of victims could reach approximately a thousand.
However, this is significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also records all cases of suicide of the East German border guards regardless of whether they were directly linked to their service.
The museum also records deaths that are not related to direct violence.
"If seniors aged between 70 and 80 years after collision with border controls died of a heart attack," it should be the consequences of this "mortal border," Hildebrante believes.
However, the state is convinced that it is necessary to make a distinction between the elderly people who may have died as a result of their experience, and those whose death was caused by a long waiting in the hot weather in the bus at the border.
Regardless of it, the recording of the victims is not easy, as the Communist East Germany authorities did not collect such statistical data, and the researchers have to investigate the documents in various dispersed archives, states the State.
However, the State Group has recently received new documents, and therefore it could soon come up with a new estimate of the number of victims.
LPF President Pone went to Rio with coach accreditation; for himself it is a surprise.
In recent days, the president of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) Kaspars Pone arrived at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro with the accreditation of a coach, but he feels surprised about it.
On Wednesday, a wide ejaculation was caused after the statements of Olympic swimmer Alona Ribakov's coach German Jakubovsky, who revealed that at the last minute to Rio de Janeiro he decided to go to Pone while the coach had to stay home.
Initially, the list of drivers was approved by swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coaches Jakubovsky and Dave Colins, as well as the president of the federation Pone.
The Latvian Swimming Federation applied for the Olympic Games five participants, and even before the departure Aldons Vrublevsky claimed that Germans will be and he is looking for tickets.
"But obviously for objective reasons he didn't," said Pone, expressing the opinion that it didn't affect the result of Ribakov.
At the request of the Federation, the UVA coach agreed to help her.
The party, who is a member of the LOC executive committee, has sharply criticized the LOC’s activity, blaming the Olympic Sports Supervisory Organization.
In my opinion, it is unethical to approve five persons in the LOC executive committee and no one of them.
"I don't know why the Swimming Federation doesn't get a place," Mr. said that the work of the Federation and its presidents is not appreciated in society, reminding that the presidents of the Federation do not receive salaries.
Pone also criticized himself Jakubovski, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he appealed to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) with a complaint and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
Mr. however could not explain why he was in the Olympics with the accreditation of a coach, which was most likely to belong to Jakubovsky.
“I was nominated as the president of the Federation (the team leader), but for unknown reasons I received the coach’s accreditation and now I’m not going anywhere.”
The situation has changed every day, the number of available accreditations has changed.
Until the last moment I thought German would be because I had no other information.
According to the agency LETA available information, a few days before Ribakov's launch she had a conversation eye-to- eye with Poni and after her swimmer was with tears in the eyes, however the president of the LPF himself stated that it was a daily conversation with the desire to feel athletes before the start.
Pone reminded that the LPF is monitoring five sports that are included in the Olympic programme, and four of them are training for children also in Latvia.
The President of the Federation stated that in Latvia the issues of sliding are also very important and that he also talked about such programs, being in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and stated that in 2018 Latvia could deal with the stage of the World Cup.
The arrival in Rio de Janeiro is not my holiday, I work here, spend my time and try to implement four-year programs.
There will be 600,000 babies.
AS Latvenergo’s fish resource restoration program this week takes place in Daugava near Mangaelsala, and this year it is planned to catch more than 600,000 single-year teeth and teeth teeth, raised in the scientific institute Bior Tomes and Doles fisheries.
Latvenergo agency LETA informed that the fishing will continue in the coming months, with a total of 6,300,000 different species of fish beats and cappuccino fishing in the basin of Daugava each year.
In the spring and early summer of 2016 will be released ladders and nights, in June - siges, in July - one-month laws, in August and September - sandals and wings.
Latvenergo Manufacturing Director Maris Kuņickis said that concerns about the environment are one of Latvenergo Group’s stages of sustainable development.
“In the fish resource protection and reproduction activities, each action is focused on environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the Scientific Institute of Bior, carrying out both the development and landing of fish infants in the basin of Daugava and the implementation of other activities,” said Kuņickis.
This year, more than 600,000 single-year teeth and vegetable babies will be dropped in the Daugava grape.
For the second year, fish babies are marked before placing, cutting the fat spray.
Today, the shipment contains 25,000 drops of babies with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Every year, in the composition and numerical volume of a scientifically grounded species in Daugava and its swimming pool waters, fish babies and stairs are placed.
The diversification of fish resources in Daugava and its basin waters in accordance with the regulatory acts is carried out by Bior on the basis of the expertise of the loss caused by Latvenergo’s economic activity to fish resources and the conclusion on what compensation measures are taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
The State Environmental Service, on the basis of this expertise, decides on the amount and type of compensation.
Latvenergo’s annual compensation amount in the fish resource restoration program is 1 035 000 EUR.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo in cooperation with the association "We fish" for the fifth year will place 400 artificial fish nurses in Daugava near Kaibal and Ikšķiles.
The cooperation with the association to promote fish natural harvest is Latvenergo also supported by an initiative within the framework of the fish resource restoration program.
The placement of artificial narrow leaves in the aquaculture is an important measure that promotes the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugava.

Reid claims that if Clinton is elected as president, he will appoint Garland as the Supreme Court judge.
Senate Democratic Party leader Harry Reid is confident that if he becomes president, he will nominate Merick Garland as the Supreme Court's chief judge.
The Senate Republican Party has blocked the approval of Garland since March when he was nominated by President Obama.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has announced that the next president will choose who will replace the current Supreme Court judge Antonin Skali.
On Thursday during his conference, Reid announced that he is confident that Clinton will choose Garland.
Reid's representative later stated that he personally did not talk about this topic with Clinton and they are just speculations.
He praised Garland and stated that Clinton's team would not want to "shake the ship" with another choice.
Garlands is the chief judge of the U.S. District Court of Appeals.
Reid said the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are "heroes" and act in the interests of the Republican party's presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also stated that Trump is not suitable for the president's work.
The Treat announces a calendar for women and men.
The magazine Treats will collaborate with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 Pirelli calendar in the 1970s style.
In its 2017 NU Mouse calendar, it is planned to demonstrate new supermodels, not cattle celebrities.

Greenland Horse Is The Longest Living Backbone - Video Review
Scientists claim that the Grenland sharks have the longest life of all the rectangles on our planet.
Hawaiian researcher Julius Nielsen tells that the long-living record belongs to a mother who could be 272 to 512 years old and five meters long.
The French court rejected the claim to break down shops in the jungle refugee camp.
A French court rejected the lawsuit by the Calais authorities to break down dozens of self-built shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court session this week in Kalai, the authorities said that the state should dismantle 72 self-made shops where people in the camp area sell various goods such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairstyles, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for a few euros in self-made restaurants.
The Kale prefecture office said these self-made companies should be destroyed because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as cause fire and sanitary risks.
Representatives of the Human Group explained to the court that these small enterprises are essential because the food supplied by the government and support groups does not satisfy the needs of the camp where the number of inhabitants continues to increase.
They also pointed out that self-made stores and restaurants often offer free patches and food for those who need it most.
Lilles court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel people who built 72 self-made stores, but it understood the concerns of the Kale prefecture.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food to people who live in "extremely unhealthy conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of breakdown is the camp cafe "Jungle Book Kids", which provides more than 200 free meals per day, English and French lessons and provides counseling on asylum issues to hundreds of vulnerable minors without adult accompaniment.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition on the protection of children’s coffee shops.
The Guardian’s letter stated that the liquidation of the cafe “will be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.”
On Friday, two charity organizations “Help to Refugees” and “L’Auberge des Migrants” that the number of inhabitants of the “Jungles” camp has increased to 9,000 people, the highest figure since the rapid flood of migrants in the summer.

The defeat brought an honorable peace prize - the silver medal, which at the time was the UK’s third medal. The UK team can be proud of their successes in the first Olympic Regbija-7 tournament in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In a heavy fight in the semi-finals, in which the Box team suffered a loss with a result of 7:5 in the first half of the day, it was likely to defeat the UK in the final.
But in any case, the Fiji selection is currently in its best form to win also 15 men's team.
Although unlikely, yet some calming for the UK could be the fact that at least one British won the golden medal. It is the Fiji chief coach Ben Ryan - former English coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Ryan, they lost all the games in the regbija-7 series stage in Adelaide.
They lost only one game this time.
The loss is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fidji impressively launched the match, depriving the British force techniques of joy after.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his colleagues, it was like a collision with several buses and the World Series champions were led by 5:0 when Osea Colinisau got the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased the dominance by realizing landing on the right wing.
The result was 12:0 and the British team didn’t even really touch the bomb.
Mitchell's great power technique did not allow the characteristic Leoni Nakaraw to get three points, but it only slightly influenced the Fidji outcome.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremalua got a land in the right corner, strengthening the overwhelming over Britain to 17:0.
After overwinning, Nakarava increased the overwhelming and had left more than a minute until the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some unsuccessful British force techniques and crossed the line, gaining points.
The landing resulted 29:0.
It seemed that the Fidji were born to play regbija-7 matches, while the British are just learning.
In fact, that is the case too.
The British team made substantial changes in the half-time, transmitting the Fiji player line... full four minutes, which after the first half-time standards were good until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team match, gained a few more points for the Fiji team.
Denam Norton managed to score points for the British team by landing in the left corner and achieving the result of 36:7, but the game was already lost, while Southern Sullivan fans sang, swallowed flags and danced in the tribines.
You can’t be surprised by Fidji’s livelicious attitude.
Mata Viliame made Fiji's victory even more sweet with another landing at the end of the game.
By announcing the end of the game, the Fidji could begin to celebrate, but the British after defeat only managed to sit in the hall.
In the first half of the day, the Fiji defeated Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were over South Africa, where in a very silk fight both teams got by land and the South African lost only a few points.
In the first half, Kail Brown set out the boxing team under the leadership, and in the second half, Dan Norton crossed the line with a brilliant mastery and delivered the ball between the stages, ensuring the British a victory.
Mark Watson, who is the brother of the English regbi-15 team player Antonius, the great strength at the end of the game provided the team with a victory and another silver medal.
The coach’s fight against cancer inspired Helena Glover and Heteri Staning to win the airing competition.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races and it already expresses a lot.
From the first to the last wind, Helena Glover and Heter Staning's golden moment played a special role on the Estacio da Lagoa route.
Although there are only two athletes on the ship, she was accompanied by the support of Robin Williams, who inspired her until the second Olympic gold medal to win a pair of women in airing, becoming the first women in the British sports history to such success.
She undoubtedly dominated because the 39th time she won an unprecedented, unprecedented victory.
Both great athletes with a sleepy elegance sliding over the water surface, do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind each winning gold medal in the air is a whole team working hard to keep the athletes improving their performance and the greatest contribution to their success was given by the coach who didn’t know before 30 months if he would experience this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to her, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had a pancreatic cancer, which is one of those that can be operated and that happened.
If not, it will spread throughout the body.
The situation is uncontrollable.
This changes your vision a little.
William was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
This trio succeeded that William could start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 intersection and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum if it can be said.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
This stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital and I went 6, 10 and even 15 meters long distances, although the doctor said I would get to some steps.
So all started.
Airing itself is a challenge, but this time it was even greater.
After the victory, the first thought was immediately about William, who was very anxious all the morning and spoke more than usual in an anxious impression.
Staning, who served at the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: "This was an emotional hard week, but it means a lot for me."
It only confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
The three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we’t anything, so great thanks to him, he’s the best coach in the world.
I can’t imagine a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Hetere Staning have not lost in any races over the past five years.
The pair reaches such a huge speed that the competitors cannot compete.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Staning and Glover's overwhelming was too big.
We feel every moment.
Helen screamed: “Stay the rhythm, keep the rhythm.”
Not to lose concentration is very important.
We had a good start, but at the same time we had no high expectations.
On that day we didn’t intend to break the records, but just well air and win the races and we did it too.
It will take a few years to decide what to do next.
The next month will be the wedding of Glover and television adventure searcher Steve Bashal.
She just wanted to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say that this was my last race.
That would have been a big pressure.
I took about six months in London to understand that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very worried.
This time it took about 4 minutes.
She said, “The feeling is fantastic.”

The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors.
According to him, now the Minister President Marim Kučinski (Green and Farmers Union) and the Minister of Finance Dan Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers Union) are already "principally important" to approve the candidates of the Minister of Finance Koľegovu as head of the VID.
Raevsky read that both Kučinsky and Reizniece-Ozola in this government the approval of the leader of the VID is the "first big decision" that can affect him as the future of politicians.
If now he begins to change his position in the choice of a candidate for the leadership of the VID, then this will have a negative impact on the administration of his imidges.
The agenda of the next week of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the question of the shift of the head of the VVD to the post of general director of the VID, according to the government’s agenda.
Coalegovu VID headquarters was shifted by the finance minister Reizniece-Ozola after the department's leadership was withdrawn by Inara Peterson and when the competition for the post of general director of VID ended without a result.
The executive officer Dace Peleka said on Thursday, 11 August, in an interview with Latvian Radio - if she was offered to be a candidate for the leadership position, then she could agree.
The Minister of Finance later admitted that no other candidates for the post of head of the VID are currently considered.
Also the leader of the National Union Saeima group, Raivis Dzintars, acknowledged that the NA continues to support the Koelegov VID in the leadership.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit threatens the failure to form a government.
A month earlier, the European Commission (EC) issued a opinion that Spain and Portugal have not taken sufficient measures to reduce the budget deficit to the euro area demanded 3% of the GDP.
The estimates show that despite the savings implemented, the Portuguese budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP, while in Spain - 5.1%.
However, the European Commission has decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while setting fiscal objectives for the nearest time.
One of the reasons why the European Commission does not impose sanctions on the two countries is the growing euroskepticism in many European countries.
Additional sanctions will only multiply such negative mood.
Critics, however, point out that the European Commission is not consistent in its decisions, initially agreeing on unified rules and then failing to apply them in life.
For example, German Bundesbank President Jens Veidmann stated that Europe thus loses confidence in itself, giving citizens the idea that the rules of the European Union are recommending and not binding.
Now the Commission has proposed and all the Member States have approved to extend the period of budget deficit settlement until the end of this year for Portugal and for Spain until 2018.
The European Commission promises to review the progress achieved by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to implement additional savings if the circumstances require it.
Initial forecasts show that the objectives for Portugal could be achieved at the time specified and that this year the budget deficit could be reduced to 2.5 per cent of the GDP.
This means that in the framework of the Stability Programme, this country’s government must implement savings measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year’s budget, with additional focus on the control of the costs of purchases of goods and services.
In Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and in 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
Furthermore, for the next two years, consolidation measures should be approximately 0.5% of GDP annually.
This is complicated by the fact that the Spanish political parties have failed to agree on the formation of a government for eight months, and the chances are increasing that Spain may have to hold a preliminary parliamentary election for the third time a year.
But public opinion surveys show that the third election will not significantly change the political scene in the country.
The most popular party remains the people's party led by the current Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, whose election will regain at least 33% of the votes.
The socialists have increased their popularity slightly, while the popularity of the party “Podemos” or “Together we can” and “Ciudadanos” or “Citizens” against the saving measures has slightly decreased.
The People's Party wants to socialist and citizens' involvement in the government this month, otherwise it will not be able to adopt and submit to the European Commission for approval the 2017 budget draft until mid-October.
Raphael Hernando, a representative of the People's Party's parliamentary group, said that if the government fails to be formed and the parliamentary elections will be held for the third time, Spain will become the whole Europe's joke.
The purity of the rainfall in the Riga Bay is critical.
In the fifth year of exploration of the beaches, the activists concluded that unfortunately, the number of waste found increases every year, and here the majority of swimming pools are guilty.
The most polluted swimming pool is in Riga.
The capital's mind explains that the swimming pools are cleaned every day, but fighting unclean visitors is quite difficult.
In addition, land-leased waste during rain gases can be wrapped in the water, thus sharply threatening its quality.
Apart from the beaches of Leipzig and some places in Kurzemé, the cleanliness of the beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This announcement was spread this week by the volunteers of the “My Sea” campaign.
Five years by foot measuring the road along the Riga Bay, the activists concluded that the number of residues left by the population has increased by a hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year this critical assessment has come into place.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of waste on the beach 100 meters may even exceed 200 units," says the expedition "My Sea" representative Janis Ulme.
Latvian Radio calls, he was on the beach of Tūja, where a volunteer walk continues along the Riga Bay.
This year, among the various household waste and picknick remaining activists came to gather even the daylight lights, which were left in the sea sand.
The participant and organizer of the tour Ulme says that the pollution is directly guilty by the citizens.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, as more than half of the total waste is plastic, different waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already in the breakdown stage, they are no longer possible to identify, and smoke, bottles, cracks," says Ulme.
Among the poorest beaches there are also swimming pools in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgriva, about 800 units of waste are collected per 100 meters, which is critical.
The organizers of the campaign also explain that I take every step by measuring the smoke and not everywhere the warning or prohibition signs are placed.
“The average numbers of all three Riga swimming pools together – Daugavgrīvu, Vakarbulli and Vecacki – unfortunately are big and far exceed the desired or goal, to which Latvia seems to move, by 2020 to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units,” the environmental advocate concludes.
The cleansing of swimming pools in Riga takes place every day, in the hotest days of the summer even twice, explains the idea representative Ugi Vidauskis.
However, fighting unclean visitors is quite difficult.
We are returning to the culture issue.
“With those who sweat, drink alcohol, smoke and do all the things that should not, even special signs don’t work,” Vidauskis says.
Therefore, Vidauskis calls on the visitors to report the pollutants to the police.
You can call the police, safely indicate these violations and thus fight all.
Maybe some new warnings can be imposed, but, as I said, it’s hardly going to change the situation radically.
"As everyone should simply fight together and be intolerant to such offenders," he emphasizes.
At the same time, water quality measurements have been carried out by the Health Inspectorate for the fourth time this summer, which can establish a ban on official swimming sites.
This year, as in other years, water quality is good and satisfying everywhere.
Currently, the situation is that in all 56 swimming pools the water quality has been good all the time and there are no swimming limits.
"The last time we will take the analysis in late August," says the inspection senior environmental health specialist Normunds Kadiq.
During heavy rains, the waste left on the ground can be wrapped in the water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, says the environmental specialist.
Rotations in the Russian elite continue - the change of leader in the Putin administration.
He left his job?
Vladimir Putin told the Russian media that Sergei Ivanov wanted to leave this post himself and will continue to be President’s Special Representative in Natural Protection, Ecology and Transport Affairs.
In the announcement of the changes, Putin addressed Ivanov’s welcome words in front of the television cameras: “Dear Sergei Borisovich, we have been working with you for many years and do it successfully.”
I am satisfied with how you perform your duties.
I will well remember our agreement not to use you in this post of president administration for more than four years.
Therefore, I will deal with your desire to change the field of action with consciousness.
And I hope that you will also fully use your knowledge and experience in the new position.
However, it is stated that the leadership of the presidential administration is a very important position and that has made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Given that in Russia the coming National Assembly elections, rumors have been revealed that this step is linked to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also referred to as a possible replacement of Putin in the presidency, so the claim that he himself wanted to take the presidency representative in natural protection and transport issues raised doubts.
According to the archive of Lsm.lv, Ivanov is the Chief General of the VDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been meaningful and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his expeditions in 1975, where he met with Putin.
Later, Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
The first President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, was appointed Secretary of the Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin arrived in power, Ivanov's "Information Security Doctrine" was approved, which included the revival of the state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergey Ivanov became the Minister of Defense of Russia, but already in 2005 - the Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defence companies and weapons exports.
Now, after the death of the chairman of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also retain a place in the Russian National Security Council, where the new chairman of the presidential administration will also work.
The guilt comes from the family of the Soviet party elite.
The post of chairman of the presidential administration was recommended by Ivanov himself.
And Antonovich and I have been familiar for a long time.
From the time we worked in the government.
And over the past almost five years we have communicated practically every day.
"Therefore, I'm sure that according to all the professional and personal characteristics he's ready for this job," Ivanov said.
The guilt comes from a family that belonged to the Soviet party elite.
His grandfather Karl occupied high positions in the Communist Party of Estonia, including ten years until 1988, he was its first secretary.
The Internet edition "Meduza" with a reference to the book "Iguan's self-establishment and independence" writes that at the end of the 80s Karl Vaino had asked Moscow to give permission to use force against the protesters.
However, he was rejected and soon lost his position.
Shortly after that, Vino moved to live in Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from the Moscow Institute of International Relations and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the Presidential Protocol.
It has already been that in the last few weeks Russia has been shocked by the dismissal and even arrest of several high-ranking officials, including the replacement of governors of several regions and federal representatives.
Political scientists say President Vladimir Putin will rebuild the ruling elite before the upcoming elections in 2018.
One of the main features is that the representatives of the power structures are increasingly in leadership positions.
Also, the judo squad Nickyforenko loses in the first battle of the Olympic Games.
This was the first round of the struggle, and the Latvian judo squad finished his participation in the Olympics, finishing 17th place.
Coach Oleg Baskins told Latvian Television that Nikiforenko's expectations were very little, and that was already clear before the competition.
He also revealed that the Jews had a shoulder in the battle.
Significantly, in order to meet at the Olympic tour, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than usual - i.e. in a weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani cabbage was about 25 kilograms heavier.
It has already been that Yevgeny Borodavko in the fight in the weight category up to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki stood for two and a half minutes, until the opponent managed to win a net worthwhile match.
Therefore, the Latvian Judo competition in Rio has ended.
The dreams disappear in the sand of Rio.
On Thursday, Jevgeny Borodowko was introduced by the Jews.
Yes, he had a title opponent against him, but ambitious times can make a surprise.
He did not shop.
For Arthur Nikiforenko, the task was even more complicated, because the experience was less and the opponent was also respectful.
The result is similar, though on the tatami he held the way a half-and-a-minute longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, the Latvian Jews have mostly missed ambition.
Since the side of the federation's leadership passed Gunar Kirson and his financial statue Vladimir Shestakov, from Latvia left Alexander Jackevič, no longer takes place "Golden Score", - the development of the judo runs by the downward line.
Jackević, who consults Kazakhstan’s Jews here, and Vsevold Zellonius, the heirs are not seen.
But if they don’t, they won’t.
This is the federation’s prerogative.
Therefore, as from another galaxy "In the Morning Panorama" sounded the promise of the President of the Latvian Judo Federation to win the medals in Rio.
Flight far from reality.
In the evening with impatiency and concern we waited for the beach volleyball match Samoilovs/Smydyn - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
The intrigue as already in the "noise" group - the losers games ended.
The Latvian duet had a small deviation - he could also lose, but not more than four points in two sets.
Strength increased in the last game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the windy card turned over the entire match length.
The bright wind created additional complications for the players.
At first it seemed that it could be our all-round allies.
But it did not.
Playing against the Latvian duet here was quite easy.
Serv just to Samoilov and wait for him to break.
Against the Canadian invasion, against Cuba, the first set ended and the third start, because the burden was not by jok.
The snake could fishing at that time because the work was little, but when it was, he did it for honor.
The Brazilian Samoilov was able to win in two sets, since the first took over the lead with 16:15, but on 16 also remained, extending the lost points limit.
But he could also lose by 0:2, because the deficit in the second set was -4, however, thanks to the weak, he managed to win.
The third has already been held in the Evandru serviced mark.
The chain was formed - uncertainly taken the servant, the second touch often flies too close to the network and Samoilov had a very little option for a resulting attack.
If against the Cubans there was some stranger Samoilov in the field, then this time he worked more successfully, and only to put the loss to the Sasha would be unprofessional.
Also, Kreil mistaken, and quite symbolically that the last ball in the block hit just him.
The team loses.
This time missed the success - in the third set only two Evander attacks almost flew out of the card, but the ball still hit the line.
Two of them were next to the line.
Also controversial episodes video decided for the good of the opponents.
If in the first two games Evandru was dirty with servers, then against us they were very productive.
Everything was summed in loss on the table.
Now we need to calmly analyze the causes of failure.
Per it had to live next to the stadium, not with a delegation in the Olympic village.
The road lasted two and a half hours.
Per a little self-confidence was given by the seven semi-final series.
Per Klagenfurt didn’t have to play, but you’d come here faster and better acclimatize.
Maybe there was a mistake in finding the top of the sports form.
A question is more than an answer.
The games have ended.
The dream of medals is over.
What next?
There are still a few World Cup tournaments and the Maritime Masters.
Smoothie with Samoilov has never been friends in life and will not be so because there are too different personalities.
But it is also not necessary.
When the dream of Olympic medals is broken, the idea of divorce can also arise, because the guilt will be sought not only in yourself, but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to find a partner, but it will be much more difficult to find a partner.
Both brothers play a bit, but John and Tom have already tried and also self-charged, while Michael Samoilov is still too green to start defeating the world's peak.
You can try Harald Regge, Alexander Solovey, Edgar Toch, to return to the Martyn Plovin, but it will not be better than this option, which has not once proved itself in the World Cup stages.
This time the sand didn’t laugh.
and all.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new couples come into the circle, and only the rare height is less than two meters.
This does not guarantee success yet, but is an important argument in the struggle for victory.
The lengths are not left.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to visit the sites offered by the organizers of the games, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players do not stay in the Olympic village.
Also, some beach volleyballists have been searching for a hotel in Kopakaban.
This time, for the journalists offered all the affordable accommodations were required a strongly overwhelmed price.
Therefore, the choice also fell on the apartment Irish.
The risk is because sometimes they may be uncomfortable from the logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich we rent apartments on the border of Kopakaban and Ipanema.
Pludmale at a distance of 200 meters, a half-hour walk from the bikes arena.
The area is quite safe because of the favelas patal, but the alertness should not be lost here too.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some instantly imagine, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It seems that another medal dream was drowned on Friday morning.
In the 100 meters barrier and highlight, Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa dropped from her personal records.
There are five disciplines.
After 10 years of interruption, “Porgy and Besa” is in Leipzig.
The opera "Porgy and Besa" was first studied in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognised masterpiece has not been repeated.
This is why the organizers of the Cess Art Festival and the Liepa Art Forum have decided in close cooperation to give the listeners the opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin's sheder.
“We are very pleased that after a ten-year break, when the last time Leipzig was able to enjoy the opera institution, this magnificent version of the opera concert study of George Gershwin ‘Porgy and Besa’ is available to us in the new, renewed concert hall ‘Great Jintars’,” says the director of the concert hall ‘Great Jintars’ Baiba Bože.
The Opera "Porgy and Besa" is a bright musical narrative of love, its instability, passion, as well as household tragedies and simple everyday pleasures.
It reflects African American vitality, music and rhythm.
This is the lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so vivid.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and somehow really deep," says director Viestur Kairiš.
What I like most - listening or playing this opera, there are always such stops - famous melodies, famous motives, but these passes from one character to another, illuminating one character or another character, or cor, or orchestra.
"This is the most exciting, this building," the opera is appreciated by the musical director and director of the opera "Porgy and Besa" concert study and director Andris Poga.
Visitors of the opera agree that this is a grand event.
They are very pleased to hear this world-famous Gershvin opera.
I am glad that you can breathe the world.
"The performance is professional," the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgar Lam.
The concert study was special with the fact that in the newly opened concert hall "Great Jintars" the orchestra played for the first time in the orchestra bedra and the opera concert was held for the first time.
The field near the Museum of Art renovated buildings could be named in the name of Jaņa Rozentala.
The vicemire of Riga Andris Ameriks at the opening of the Rosenthal Jubilee exhibition said that the museum’s own address in the future could not be the 10a street of Krishna Valdemar, but the 1st street of Jauna Rosenthal.
The director of the museum, Māra Lāce, acknowledged that the re-registration of the address will create a heavy bureaucratic burden, but in general this idea is welcomed and therefore agreed to the municipality’s proposal.
The city of Riga puts a kind of foundation to this idea in 1936 by building the monument of the Burkard Zen to Jan Rozenthal, who stands next to the museum.
The former director of the museum, William Purwitt, was one of the initiators for the creation of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I have a little bit of consciousness all the time - but William Purvity, where will we keep his name?
“But if you, Mr. America, promise to think,” Lace said.
It is said that the National Museum of Art building after ambitious reconstruction and modernization will officially open its doors in May this year.
This week we will finally begin the reconstruction of the VEF Cultural Palace.
A total of about 11 million euros will be repaid.
It is planned to renovate several castle rooms, including two audience halls, as well as the building to adapt to people with movement disorders.
The Riga Dome has intended to attract the project funds of the European Union in the amount of €6 million, but the director of the Riga Dome Property Department, Oleg Burov, acknowledges that for now there is no complete clarity about the European funds for the project.
"In spite of the fact that the political desire to start the VEF Cultural Palace repairs, attracting European structural funds, is, we wait for months for a decision, real action from the Ministry of Finance officials, it will be the money allocated or not," says Burov.
In December last year, we told us that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission to make its own decision that Brussels will not make a decision here.
Currently, we see that another discussion circle is forming again, well, then we’ll see what we can expect in the coming days.
“I want to say that the Riga Duma without a doubt guarantees that this process will be started and completed in time,” Burov said.
It has already been that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Cultural Palace collectively held a goodbye concert before the immediate, immediate renovation of the building.
Although the year has passed, the renovation of the building has not yet been started and collectively continued to work under unsuitable conditions.
In the strategy of the property department of Riga, the VEF Cultural Palace renovation is divided into apparently independent rebuilding works, where each will ensure the implementation of different castle functions.
First - increasing the availability of the VEF Cultural Palace and the repair of the surrounding area.
It is intended to arrange the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as to restore the facade of the building.
The second is the improvement of the offer of VEF Cultural Palace services.
It plans the restoration of the building's interior, walls and roofs, the improvement of the studio of the stage and sound recordings, as well as the arrangement of the building's internal engineering communications.
Third - Improving the working conditions of creative amateur collectives, which includes plans to improve workshops equipment, room heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of the "Live" legendary handgroup can be met at the exhibition in Liepa.
The exhibition will show various "Livus" characteristic objects - photographs that are repeated in a timeline to reflect the activity of the group from the beginning to the year 2010, when the end of the group's activity is announced.
There will also be showings of the participants' stage clothes, musical instruments, awards and concert letters, as well as other things that have not yet been seen to the wider audience, which reflect the creative activities of the group "Livi".
The exhibition will be supplemented with the museum's stock objects.
The visual design of the exhibition was made in cooperation with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalnieci.
Also musicians who were associated with the group "Livi" and their neighbors referred to the invitation and shared both items and memories.
The origins of "Livu" were sought in 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble was created in the Cultural House of Leipzig, led by Juris Pavītol.
The assembly in its original composition participated in the festival "Liepājas dzintars" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the city and republic views.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place when Juris Pavitol met Erich Kigeli and the Metalurg Cultural Palace founded a group, inviting Ingrid Gūtmani, Andri Krūziņu and Jani Grodumu to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has not been seen once.
Participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the main thing - the desire to prove that Latvian music is able to live and exist - remains unchanged.
"What to see is not missing - jeans, matains and bardays, these guys felt different from the generally accepted stereotype of the strade," about the group says music spectator Class Vaver.
In the group without the aforementioned musicians worked such excellent musicians as Igo, Vilnis Rusviņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Štarks, Laimis Rācenai, Talis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Bríze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Klein and many others.
Entrance to the exhibition is free.
The exhibition will be viewed from 19th August to 30th October.
At the same time, on August 27th in the Leipzig Concert Garden "Put, Winds" will be the 40th anniversary celebration of the group "Livi" "Livifest 2".

Zbigniew Stankević: The time comes, and the truth rises.
The archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church Metropolitan Zbigniew Stankević in an interview with the Independent emphasizes that if we want to gain strength to life, the center of it must be the gospel message.
For the power of truth is greater than the darkness of evil.
Many are already on the way to the Holy Virgin Mary in heaven for the reception holidays in Aglon.
What news will the faithful receive this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main divine ministry in Aglon has been expressed by the Pope's nuntion.
Therefore, the main content of the message is also in his mind.
For some kind of tradition, it is also the fact that the Cross Road is guided by the bishop Janis Bulis.
He also sends his message.
On the last day, I took the celebration of the vigilia.
Last year I addressed the Encyclical "Laudato si" of Pope Francis and updated the common house, the theme of the Earth in the context of Latvia.
This year... of course, I’m watching what’s happening in the world, and I’m trying to react to it in my speech.
My approach is in line with the church’s recommendation that the gospel message should be in the center of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of man’s life and gives him inspiration for a further path.
It speaks to people.
But Césus, in the discussion of the Lamp, you say that "to return to the understanding of a full man."
What do you understand about it?
Does this mean that man is removed from the message of the church?
Does the church have such a resource of return today?
In the capital of India, a man is killed on the road.
In the capital of India, no one was laughed or aware of a man who died on the side of the road - it turns out that he fell on the side of the road for an hour and then was still robbed, reports the BBC.
It is that the man, identified as Matibul, was driving on the day with a rocket, but at night he worked for the guard.
Matthew went home at 5:30 a.m. on the road when he was hit by a light car.
The recording of the monitoring cameras indicates that the driver came out of the car to look at the victim and then left.
After an hour, when no one licked or knew about a bleeding man, he was stolen by a garnadzi.
About 90 minutes after the incident, the police arrived and the victim was taken to the hospital where he died from the wounds.
With his candidacy to the post of Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the head of the State Environment Service, Inga Koļegova, saved the government from the collapse, believes the associate professor of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia, Ojar Skudra.
Coelho's explanation on the withdrawal of the candidacy in connection with the contradictions in the ruling coalition is linked to the fact that it has prevented the fall of the government.
Skudra talks with the agency LETA said it was hard for him to imagine that the next week in the government's session "Unity" would support the candidacy of Kolegova.
Therefore, if the "United" ministers vote against, but the Colegue approves the position, it will lead to a government resignation.
Also, the expert believes that before the announcement of the withdrawal of the candidacy, Koļegova has consulted both with the Minister of Finance Dan Reiznieci-Ozol and the Minister President Mari Kučinski.
At the same time, it was also the adherence to the "Unity", which strictly opposed her candidacy.
Predicting whether it will succeed with the help of the contest to find the suitable candidate, Skudra admitted that there are two options - either a compromise figure will be selected or the institution as the executive of the duties of the general director will continue to be led by Dace Pelec.
At the same time, he points out - if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that no other candidate is being considered, it is the house of the Pelekaya that he cannot participate in the competition.
LETA has already that the head of the State Environment Service Koļegova has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director-General of the VID.
Due to the objections of the "Unity", the government on Tuesday for a week withdrew the approval of Koelegov as the Director-General of the VID.
After the government’s decision to postpone the decision, Koļegova confirmed that he was still ready to become the leader of the VID.
However, later the opinions changed - on Friday in a statement to the Minister of Finance Danai Reizniece-Ozola she points out that she withdraws her consent to move to the leadership of the VID and this is not an easy choice for her.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
There was an accident in the centre of Riga involving a police car.
A road crash occurred in the centre of Riga this afternoon involving a police car.
The police car with connected sound and light signals has rushed to the highest category calls, until it collapsed with another car on the crossroads of the Baron and Zirnav Street.
Police clarify the circumstances, but the initial information shows that the second force did not throw away the police car.
A woman was killed in the accident.
This year, the number of people in Riga has risen.
At the beginning of this year there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when 641 000 inhabitants were officially registered in the capital, the agency LETA informed the Central Statistical Administration (CSP).
In terms of the population, the capital of Latvia is ranked 30th among the European Union (EU) and the major cities with a population of more than one million.
According to the EU Bureau of Statistics "Eurostat" data, Riga has the highest proportion of women - the capital of Latvia is convincingly the first among the largest cities in Europe with 127 women per 100 men.
All three Baltic capitals have the highest proportion of women in the major cities of Europe: in Vilnius they are 123, and in Tallinn 121 women per 100 men.
There will be an alert pictogram.
In the coming days at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM) will be placed warning signs - pictograms, the agency LETA told the representative of the department of Riga House Property Baiba Gailite.
Currently, the museum has successfully completed the recovery of the glass speed damage that had occurred as a result of the action of the skateboards.
In the coming days there will be a warning pictogram.
Its citizens will be informed that the cover tends to be a slide in the rain and snow, it is not permitted to move by cars, as well as to visit by bicycles, skyscrapers and skyscrapers.
About this on the social network "Facebook" then wrote also Ushakov, who pointed out that no security threats the damage does not cause, but "looking unclean" and the sketbordists "will go down".
For children and parents, new children’s playgrounds are installed in Riga.
In this summer season, the municipality of Riga has installed even two new playgrounds in the city, Cyprus and Chekurkalna, which are now available for children.
A wide, multifunctional gaming vessel with various climbing elements, bridges, games, tubes and slides.
The rolling field is for children of all ages.
In the field are also installed bulbs and various balancing elements.
The fantasy world for small ships is filled with the attractive location on the shore of Daugava with a view of the passenger port and the cruise ships visible there.
In turn, the playground between the 4th and 5th barrier lines of Chekurkalna has a playground, a batut, a staircase route, a balance bridge, a shoulder, a game ball and other game elements, as well as an exercise area with rounds of strength and coordination training, along with sports elements and so on.
Under the field is a rubber cover in different colors.
Up to the playground on the side of the street, a new, colorful bridge cover is placed.
A reconstructed stage of the road was discovered.
Traffic Minister Uldis Augulis, VAS Latvian State Roads (LVC) management, as well as builders SIA "Binders" and municipality representatives today uncovered the reconstructed state main road of the Russian border (Grebnev) -Rezekne-Daugavpils- border (Medumi) (A13) stage from Medumi to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05 km).
The roads are a national visit card, especially the border roads, so a special pleasure is to discover the reconstructed stage on the border with our southern neighbors.
This is another example that, thanks to the co-financing of the EU funds, the situation on the main roads of the country is improving.
“As the forecast shows, the funds available for the roads will be obtained during this planning period in 2018, and we have to think about how to continueining the most slated roadways in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of the citizens in all Latvian regions without the funding of the European Union,” the symbolic panel was reversed by Uldis Augulis.
The Ministry of Traffic also said that the proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing of the Latvian roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
Construction works in the stage from the Medum to the Lithuanian border (156.4.-163.05. km) SIA Binders started last year and this year continued after a technological interruption.
The cost of the reconstruction is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERAF).
“In the reconstructed phase of the road, the construction of the road has been completely restored and the next year the repairs will begin in the next phase from Medum to Daugavpilj itself, thus all the road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpilj will be arranged,” said LVC board chairman Janis Lange.
The main highways in the country are the most shrinked, and by 2018 we plan to that all of the main highways in the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, providing timely periodic maintenance and perform asphalt surface replacement every 7-9 years.
“It will, of course, require adequate funding, and all travellers will look forward to the expert group’s proposals for the arrangement of the road financing system,” Lange noted.
In the framework of the project, road connections and lighting are arranged in the Medum center.
Significant landwork: in four stages of large amounts of refurbishment and enormous recording and drawing works, a balanced road garenprofil, which has so far been very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been renewed and a re-built touring area for public transport has been built.
Previously the road had insufficient impotence and the surrounding relief was not transparent due to the mountainous streets, as well as the old road shared relief.
The next construction season is planned to restore the road stage from the city’s border to the now reconstructed stage (144,80.-156,40 km).
This year, LVC plans to carry out various types of works over more than 1100 kilometers of the state road.
Information about all the planned repairs on the national road network this year is available on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
"To the desired weight loss results, it is very important to choose the right food combinations," acknowledges Lithuanian dietologist Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
In addition, it is easily achieved in the summer period, when fresh fruits, beans and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
A thoughtful combination of dietary products can help not only reduce excess weight, but also aimed at promoting different processes in the body.
Makarons and ethetics are a successful combination because they provide a long-term seed feeling and help fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that ethics beneficially affects blood glucose levels and helps us feel humble.
Cayenne peppers and protein-rich foods, such as bird meat or protein cocktail, not only create a feeling of satiety, but also reduce the cough after big meals in the next meals.
This combination of foods can increase the amount of calories burned even after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies show that Cayenne pepper can help get rid of the fat shell in the abdominal area.
The composition of eggs contains a metabolic nutrient - choline, while pepper is a good source of vitamin C.
Using sufficient amounts of these nutrients can reduce the level of cortisol, thereby the accumulation of fat around the middle of the body.
Eggs, which is added to fresh beans, is another delicious and fat burning meal for breakfast, which is worth included in your menu.
Eggs and beans contain fiber that, according to the findings of Canadian scientists, control grelin - the appetite-stimulating hormone - and thus the feeling of hunger.
In addition, beans contain polyphenols that are helpful in weight loss, as well as prevents the formation of fat.
Herbs and proteins are also able to do miracles in weight loss.
Such a combination can create a satiate feeling.
Grasses contain water and fiber, thus promoting the feeling of satire.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestive process and provide a feeling of saturation for a longer period of time.
At lunch, you can eat a whistle with salads or prepare a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
What combinations of products to avoid?
The fruit contains sugar - monosaccharides or disaccharides - the compounds of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, the firm that is found in vegetables is polysaccharide.
The fruits are mechanically divided into the stomach, while chemically they are not divided until they reach the third or fourth stage of the digestive process that occurs in the intestine.
The thickness is divided into three different stages, which begin already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is essential not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
Eating sweet food immediately after a meal, it is "sprayed" into the stomach along with other foods, where it is not chemically digested and begins to smell.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, cherries, bananas, datels or other carbohydrate-containing products along with citrons, salmon, orange, grapefruit, ananas or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptialin, which is found in the seals, only works in a serum environment.
Fruit acids not only prevent the digestion of carbohydrates, but also promote their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar protein-rich products combinations in one meal.
Their processing requires a variety of digestive juices, each with a different strength, characteristics and time to get into the stomach.
Arbus, honeymelon, muskatmelon and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons are not melted if they are in the stomach along with other foods.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats make a successful combination with solid, but the same cannot be said about fats and proteins - fats prevent protein digestion.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large amount of protein-containing products is consumed, avoid the use of fat completely.
This also applies to freshness - it is not recommended to combine a large amount of nuts (contains proteins) with a whole avocado (contains fats).
This combination prevents effective weight loss.
How to cook better?
"Food preparation, thermal processing causes a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the product's original nutrient composition," dietologists say.
In most cases, nutrients go lost, dried foods in water.
However, the value of some food nutrients increases, directly baked.
After cooking vegetables, the remaining fluid is recommended to use for the cooking of soups - in this case you will not lose the nutrients left in the water, and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to cook the vegetables, even when they are dried.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of the tomato composition of likopen.
Cooking tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of likopene increases by 25%.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene, which is found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The thermal processing of eggs and meat removes the natural properties of the proteins in them, making them easier to digest.
Also, the thermal processing of meat and eggs makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products easier to absorb in the body.
It should also be remembered that product freezing can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to 90%, while fiber freezing does not affect.
Butter in combination with tomatoes can increase the intake of iron in the body, which in turn provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body consumes up to 33% less non-blooded iron found in plant products such as butterflies, leaf greens, grain products, than blood-blooded iron found in animal products such as beef meat, fish and beef.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-blooded iron in the body by consuming non-blooded iron-containing products in the diet along with C-vitamin sources such as orange, tomatoes and beans.
Vitamin C helps to change non-blooded iron so that our body is easier to absorb it.
Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, which provides oxygen delivery to the muscles and the brain.
To get the maximum benefit from the salads, add to them healthy fats, such as olive or linen oil.
When preparing peanut butter with a glass, add with vitamin D-rich leather or sardines free of powder yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestine, and it plays an essential role in the process of bone formation.
Eggs (as well as other full grain products) together with sources of vitamin C, such as potatoes, rivers, avenues and other fruits or beans, help to stabilize cholesterol levels, as well as to avoid arterial stretching.
Snapchat’s “Anime” effect is criticized
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators say it is racistly uncomfortable.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users daily to change reality in an absurd way and play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into ananas, a dog or an image that will fit the painting of King Liechtenstein.
Lenses are melting, image distorting instruments that generate more than 30 million transformed selfie per day.
Any mistake quickly becomes publicly noticeable.
Snapchat lens effects have been previously criticized by receiving fraud that the application promotes too black or bright tones of the face skin as an ideal beauty reference.
This week, new lens effects were published, which enables users to form a sliding eye, a sliding tooth and a round stretch, and some critics called it a racist Aziatic cartoon – a “green family”.
It was also questioned whether such contradictions do not indicate that the company has greater problems with diversity.
News and public negations flooded on Wednesday when the “The Verge” and “Motherboard” publications that the lens effects were removed from the application.
The company explained that the objective of the lens is to paint the images of Anime, not to caricate people of Asian origin.
But people who have experienced racism, these effects resembled painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the similarity with Anime.
Korean-born American art student Grace Sparapani's Twitter post on the images gained broad resonance. in an e-mail she points out that the lens effects are "unpleasant and uncomfortable not to say more."
She adds that it is difficult not to notice the similarity seen by the eyes between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This indicates that the lens effect is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has entered these cultures.
The American culture is also involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use everyday.
And Snapchat’s large youth audience, representing different races, unlike older citizens, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "these things are not unnoticed today," said 25-year-old Keitiya Zhou in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Media’s product manager Zhou deleted his Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her article “Medium” and a telephone interview, she explained that she thought racial problems arise due to Snapchat’s employment policy that insufficiently supports racial diversity.
Zhou criticized the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men, and then concluded his article with a reference to #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are allowed. whether some representatives of other races work in the company, but they do not take such a position to be able to express their opinion safely and conveniently," says Chinese-born American Zhou.
Other people agree with her opinion, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not reveal how many employees represent different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of its employees, but its representative revealed that the company has deceived a staff specialist who will focus on the company’s representation of racial minorities that are not widely represented and will promote integration in the company.
In turn, Zou doesn’t renew his Snapchat account, adding: “It’s interesting if they really need more users like us to understand that it’s not right.”
The House of Congress has announced that military officials have distorted the reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement released on Thursday, the House of Representatives pointed out that U.S. Central Delegation representatives have ruined the reports, depicting the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than it is actually.
The Central Command Intelligence Service analysts express general dissatisfaction with the provisional report of the mission unit established by the Republican representatives of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Financing Subcommittee, indicating that their leadership controlled the reports of U.S. successes in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, monitoring U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news about this report reports that the intelligence reports, confirmed by the high-ranking Centcom leaders, reflect the U.S. fight against terrorism more positively than it is in reality.
California Republican representative Ken Calvert tells us: "Centcom's action is unacceptable - our soldiers are those who suffer if our policy makers receive false messages."
Centcom’s management errors are searched in the organization’s top management.
This 10-page report detailed the problems present in the Central Command and analyzes the U.S. efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide unmistakable evidence that the senior officials of the Obama administration would have stopped threatening the reports, it shows that the Centcom leadership has made some pressure on analysts to illustrate a more optimistic view of the threats created by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report indicates that in the first half of 2015 the Central Administration press releases, statements and reports to Congress represented the situation in a significantly more positive light than it was in reality.
For example, the representatives of the Centcom publicly announced that the recovery operation in Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul is the second largest city in Iraq, still under the control of the Islamic State.
The representative of the Republican Party of Kansas, Mike Pompeo, said in his report: "More months of investigation clearly confirms this."
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, U.S. Central Administration chief officials shocked the reports, depicting ISIS threats in Iraq weaker than they were actually.
The Republican Party established a working group, knowing that analysts were worried that the information about the Islamic State was corrupt.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will follow new discoveries in the case.
The General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defense is conducting an investigation of the activity of the Centcom intelligence service.
The members of the Intelligence Management Committee of the Democratic Party on Thursday published their own report, in which they agree to some of the Republican Party Working Group’s conclusions.
Democratic representative Adams B. Shiff in his report that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom had too much restricted the preparation of intelligence assessment reports related to ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr. Shifa explains that this process "stoped the dissemination of information", deteriorated the ethics of the work of analysts and "disclosed unreliable facts."
But Ships and members of the Democratic Party add that there is no evidence that the White House has made pressure on Centcom analysts to prepare reports according to "predefined or political position."
The Daily Beast on Thursday published the preliminary results of the congress investigation.
In August, the New York Times that the Pentagon General Inspection has launched an investigation following the complaints of Centcom analysts.
Pentagon representative Leicester Commander Patrick Evans said that the Pentagon will not comment on the congress report as long as the investigation will continue.
He also added that experts sometimes differently interpret complex data, and the Ministry of Defense and the Intelligence Administration calls for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation does not only apply to the question whether the U.S.-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a claim expressed by more and more Defence Ministry representatives).
But last year’s accusations raise doubt whether President Obama can fully rely on the Central Administration’s reports on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
The criticism of the Islamic State intelligence reminds more than a decade of events when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Husser published the study, claiming that the George W. Bush administration started the Afghan war, too little thinking of its possible consequences.
Husser also played an important role in the discovery of the issue of the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year officials that the Hussein team revealed that contrary to public reports, airstrikes on Islamic State oil plants did not significantly deteriorate the financial situation of the terrorist group as they had built temporary plants to sell oil to the black market.
The Times in September that this discovery did not come outside the Central Administration walls.
At that time, the Commander of Centcom, General Loyd Ostin III, received sharp criticism as many lawmakers believed that war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Ostin went on vacation and he was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
In the U.S. duel with the UK women's field hockey, the U.S. wins, thus gaining the fourth victory in a row.
A day after the victory over Japan with a score of 6:1, on Thursday, Keitiya Bama won the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team when the Americans defeated the Indian team with a score of 3-0.
Five goals in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bama said she could not remember what she would have ever succeeded.
She said, “I don’t have any sense.”
I’m not one of those people who count my gates.
But she knows that the U.S. score in the Olympic Games is 4:0, which gives them in their group undefined with Britain, which on Thursday after the victory over Japan with the score of 2:0 remained unbeatable.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last match in the first round.
The two teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the six teams group and which second.
The first place winner a little longer will avoid meeting with the strong Netherlands list, which is the leader of the second group.
Although the game will not open on Saturday, the Americans have already raised a surprise storm, four years ago in London taking the last place among the 12 teams.
There was also a BAM in the team.
She grew up in Blubel, the field hockey node she first took into hand at the age of 3 (her older twins sisters had already engaged in this sport in Dreksel) and joined the national selection when she was 16 years old, becoming a selection of the youngest player in history.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he did not enter the final.
But 2012 was a failure for her and her team.
The following year for the selection coach was appointed English Kreg Parham and everything changed to the right side.
Bama called it “cultural, mental and physical changes.”
We did not invest as much work in London as we are now.
We have completely changed everything.
In the game on Thursday, Bama revealed the result, gaining the gates in the first half with a backbone from a close distance.
India started the game without a victory on their account, but their selection was very sharp and held a minimum score of 0:1 until the end of the third period when Bama again got the gates.
He put the balls into the opponent zone on the left side of the field, then noticed to get to the middle of the field and broadcast the balls into the opponent gates, putting the Americans 2:0 in leadership.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzales got another gate.
This was the first dry game of the U.S. Gate Guard Jackie Brig, in each of the first three games by one gate.
She is stuck.
Bama as well.
"We are going very well now," Pahams said, but how well the game will show on Saturday.
The most suppressive meal in the period of depression is "Satury meal"
In March 1933, shortly after being elected president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the oval room to take a meal.
The President Ruzvelta tasted such subtle culinary delicacies as a soothic liver pastel or a fuagra and a merylanded snorkel soup.
But at that time his meal was much more gentle: filled eggs in a tomato potato, potato pepper and dessert - a pudding.
Jane Ziegelman says: "This is a way to solidarize in cooking with people who have been very hard."
Her husband Andrew Kou adds: "This is also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
A couple of Brooklyn Heights district are food historians.
Kou's last book "Green Cushion" describes Chinese cuisine in America, but Ziegelman in his book "97 Abels" describes life through a meal rental house in the eastern bottom of Manhattan.
Their new joint work "The Natural Meal," which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is a story of American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in the culinary, they took a meal together with reporters "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", a simple dining restaurant located in the Flatirona district and operating since 1929, when the great depression began.
The 54-year-old Mrs. Ziegelman ordered a butter with coughed cheese and folded olives, while the 57-year-old Kou ordered titer, potato pepper and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered a fake cat, the couple admitted that his choice was very suitable for the conversation about the Great Depression time meal.
Mrs. Ziegelman told me that the false rabbit was very popular.
There was a land nuts, a liver nuts and a puppies nuts.
They were cooked from the basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine how it is - eat so many potatoes that they are in the place of lunch.
Mr. Kou was shaken.
“It seemed that the stomach was full of a candle,” he added.
In the predepressive years, the American lunch table was similar to the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were preparing to eat their men-workers and breakfast, lunch and dinner were delivered fresh cooked snacks.
During the First World War, the Americans were sending food to the Europeans. "Satury meal" is described as the Americans adapted to the circumstances when America suddenly was no longer a land of abundance.
"Then food became the main object of American people's attention in everyday life," says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about this topic.
The new budget diets became equally important: unknown foods such as the fake sheep and sweets became everyday, sweets were "a great way to use the surplus," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because the sweets could hide unattractive ingredients under a cream plate.
Fresh fruits are replaced by cheap dried fruits.
Meat, which for years was the main ingredient of American dishes, has now become an extremely rare luxury product.
In a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food was more important than the taste, new, yet unseen formations were born.
In an old book, Mrs. Ziegelman found a recipe for cooking soap filled with potato butter.
Mr. Kou adds: "This was not a popular lunch table supplement."
Mrs. Ziegelman emphasizes: “It was surreal.”
Soil butter and baked soil are not compatible.
Many home food recipes applied to difficult times.
Household economists such as Luise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Economy Office from 1923 to 1943, established state eating habits that were not experienced neither before nor after the Great Depression.
Publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they recommended households to become "economists" and accept challenges such as turning a mixture of potatoes and carrots into a delicious meal.
The "Saturday Maltese" is a monument of historical flavours.
Particularly interesting are evidence of the government’s attitude to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Huber’s “Let Me Eat Cake” attitude.
Although publicly he told about his simple childhood and eating in Aiova, in fact he ate as a thin millionaire he had become.
Mr. Kou tells us: "He liked European cuisine like fish with a cabbage."
He was eating in a closed guest room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely distracted from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake unless his wife Eleonor would not recommend him to show an example with his eating habits.
The book tells that Roosevelt hated a household servant who didn’t learn how to cook, thus the White House became a place “where not only was served one of the most unhealthy meals in Washington, but also the worst cooked meals.”
As soon as the state economy recovers, the majority of the culinary patterns of the depressive era disappear.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutritional value, as well as how to apply science in the culinary, adds Mrs. Ziegelman.
The couple tell that by writing a book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Mrs. Ziegelman's mother, for example, why she couldn't throw out the food.
“She really was afraid to throw out food,” Mr. Kou said.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, “She actually traced people.”
Once there was an incident with winds.
When we were eaten at Eisenberg's dining room, a couple of writers pulled out of the pocket a house-made dessert: a pudding pudding that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"This is a flame insect," said Mrs. Ziegelman, adding that at that time there was a widespread habit for sweet foods to give a shake name.
It does not contain insect, only dried flows, a little milk, sugar, water and cannabis.
Everyone impatiently wrapped the cups in the brown mass that was on the leaves.
Surprisingly, it was not so bad.
Mr. Kou eats a few more cakes.
Listening to an experienced "economist", he said to his wife, "Derated a slice of the slice of the slice."
Gilead will receive a refund for legal expenses in the fight with Merck for Hepatitis C patent
The district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. has the right to reimburse the costs for the legal services it has paid in the case for the breach of the Hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was justified in the case for a 200 million pounds of fine for the two Merck breaches that threatened him in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets when a U.S. federal judge found breaches in Merck's operation, such as lies after the transfer of the beast and other unethical actions.
During the trial on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bates Labson Frymen said that Gilead has the right to demand compensation for the legal expenses incurred by his defence in the case.
Merck tries to gain a position in the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with the new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which are effective in 90% cases of liver diseases.
The case was launched in 2013, when Gilead and Merck appealed each other in an attempt to acquire ownership of the newly developed active component sofosbuvir, which is the main component of the Gilead drug.
The U.S.-backed forces claim to have completely overtaken control over the city of Manbij from the Islamic State.
The U.S.-backed forces under their control have completely overtaken the city of Manbij in the northern part of the country at the Turkish border and the last Islamic State soldiers have left the city, a group representative said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently cleaning the city from the last opponent fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 prisoners-civil residents captured by fighters, news agency Reuters said Sharfans Darwish from the Allied SDS Military Council of Manbij.
“The city is now under our full control and we are searching for the fighters,” he told Reuters.
Clinton’s revenue in 2015 reached $10.75 million and the pair paid a 34.2 percent federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton on Friday published the 2015 tax declaration, where it is seen that the Democrat candidate for the presidency and her husband have earned $10.75 million this year and respectively paid the federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton has donated $1 million, mainly to her Clinton charity organization. Former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million, standing as a spiker and former State Secretary received $3 million income from his book on work at the State Department, published in collaboration with "Simon & Schuster".
Clinton's election ally - U.S. Virginia State Senator Tim Keyn and his wife Anna Holtone have published their tax declaration for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Keen continue to set new standards for financial transparency,” Clinton’s campaign partner Jennifer Palmier said in a statement.
On the contrary, Donald Trump is hiding behind a variety of gains and resolutions so that he doesn’t have to fulfill his promises to disclose his tax information.
The publication of paid tax information is a recording practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers min the State Revenue Service audit as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your passenger," on his Twitter post, about the Democratic Party candidate's tax information told Clinton's campaign partner Ian Sams.
Trump’s special adviser Michael Cohen told CNN on Thursday that he will not allow Trump to publish tax information before the audits will be completed.
Trump’s critics, including the 2012 Republican party presidential candidate Mits Romney and other Republicans, claim that his rejection raises questions about his actual amounts of property, the amounts of donations and other business obligations, including his relations with Russia.
Clinton added oil to fire on Friday publishing a video where several influential Republicans ask Trump to publish their tax information.
He returned to the issue again during a economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She declared the effort: "He will refuse to do what the other presidential candidates have done for decades."
Politico reports that in the 1990s, Trump has paid very little or not paid taxes at all for two years, and on Friday, the New York Times business chain author that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of the billionair Warren Buffett’s proposal, promotes the idea that anyone who earns more than $1 million a year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, during Clinton's speech in Omaha, Nebraska, where his "Berkshire Hathaway" conglomerate is also located, Buffett called on Trump to exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said he was also undergoing a Revenue Service audit and Trump was afraid of the voters, not the tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information until 2007.
Now Clinton lives in Chapakwa, New York and in the period from 2007 to 2014 has paid an average federal tax rate of approximately 32 percent and a total tax rate of approximately 40,5 percent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax report shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is wage.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends.

The Jewish film director criticizes a hotel in Berlin for the Israeli remote-communications code unlocking on Arab request - RT News
The Jewish-born French film director shook a storm on social media when he discovered that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin has no Israeli telephone code available.
Klod Lancman, the director of the documentary about the Holocaust "Shoah", did not hide his dissatisfaction with the Berlin "Kempinski Bristol" hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent visit, Lancman tried to find the Israeli remote code in the list of hotels offered.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which you can call directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel was destroyed and destroyed?
It is Lancman.
Instead, the Campinski Bristol hotel offers you to call to this country through its call center.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the answer received "shocked them."
The hotel administrator explained that "this is a conscious decision of the hotel management."
The reason for the removal of the code even more sanicnoed the film director.
"Most guests are Arabs and they demanded the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancman quotes the hotel staff's explanation.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung that the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jakov Hadas-Handelsman, has called the case "a great shame."
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
This in itself is a great shame.
And the fact that this has happened right in Germany, right in this hotel network is even greater degradation.
Explanations are not necessary.
The official said: "We hope the hotel will make the right conclusions."
This event got a fairly broad resonance also on the internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that Kempinski’s hotel has simply hit Arab customers.
Another record said "Sorry", indicating that the hotel is located on the Kurfurstendamm Street next to the synagogue.
The Der Spiegel report that the hotel itself quickly rejected all the misunderstandings, announcing that it was all a "misunderstand" and apologized to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of nations," the Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes Kempinski representative.
And add that the code is added to the list again.
Police use rubber loads and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
Students and police struggles took place on Thursday in the city of San Paolo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against government education system reforms.
Police used rubber loads and tear gas against students.
Problems began when lawmakers tried to dismiss students, resulting in the police using rubber loads and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to demonstrate their disagree with the reforms of the educational system.
The proposal of Governor of Sanpaul, Gerald Alckmina, is to close almost 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be moved to other schools to save money.
Some protesters painted graphites on the walls with messages against the temporary president Michael Temer.
This protest took place just a few days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations in order to express support for the dismissed President Dilmy Rousef, whose impicment was voted by the Senate.
Scotland Kelum Skiners Finishes First, Britain's Gold Medal in Riding
Kelum Skiners from Scotland finished the first male riding team in the sprint races in the Rio Velodrom, which took place last night. The British team defended its championship title, which it won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in these races, making the legendary Scottish Seru Chris Hoi proud and distinguishing the victory favorites for New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain gained an amazing victory when Hoi won the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated it in the World Championship in London, although Hojs had already finished his athletic career.
The problems were in the stage between the Beijing and London Olympics, as he had to replace the experienced start specialist Jamie Staff.
They succeeded in the last moment.
When Hawk left, his place tried to fill Kian Emadi and Mets Kramptons.
British coaches put hope on Skiner, looking at her potential, which he later also proved.
Hindes, Kenya - champions who started four years ago with Hoy and Skiner, who set the Olympic Qualification Record, but the race's better start was for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Hinds after their circle were strongly encouraged, Kenny placed in leadership and Skiners defended this leadership.
Strategy change played an important role in victory as Hindes ran with greater transfer to allow Kenya and especially Skiner to run faster.
Hawk watched the races as a BBC representative and captured the eyes of Skiner, Kenya and Hindu at the time they climbed to the honour pedestal.
The 23-year-old glasswoman said, “It was an unexpected praise.”
I do everything I can to defend my word.
In the final we set the Olympic record and won the world champions.
It was simply incredible.
There is no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Hoya at the 2012 Olympics in London, Hindes acknowledges that they deliberately fell on the track after a failed start.
He later rejected this comment and the British competitors were unable to prove the opposite.
This time there was no such incident.
The Hindu expressed: "The British flags in the tribines referred to London in memory."
In the last three months we have become a joined team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory in the Olympics was really special.
One medal will be competed for the country that won seven of the ten gold medals in the wheels in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is the team’s progress in the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given Kenya's outcome, he could really repeat Hoya's success by winning three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya it would mean six winning gold and one silver medal. In addition, Kenya was also born on March 23 (it seems to be the British holy date because on that day were also born Steve Regrev, Mo Farah and Roger Banister).
At this date, Hojs was also born.
Kenya's next races are a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: "Today I just enjoy it all.
The team journey is always the best.
You can win with the team members.
If honestly, then to win one is a little lonely.”
Hindes said: "If he gets another two gold medals, he should be put in the row of the fighters."
That day it was the only struggle for medals, but it was not the only good news for the UK.
Sir Bradley Vigin, Ed Klensey, Steve Burks and Ovein Doul showed the fastest qualification time in the four-kilometre race for the fourth.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record set in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigin will be at the center of attention.
Yesterday before the qualification journey he had disagreements with the commission when judges called him to measure his growth.
In the women's journey, which will continue and end today, Laura Trota, Joan Rovsel Shand, Elinor Barker and Keith Archibald from Milan set a new record time 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British riding team, hoping. will win medals in the middle stage of the Olympic Games.
Remembering the outstanding and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone is expecting the same achievements in Rio.
Meanwhile, the backgrounds have gone differently, after accusations of sexism and honour insult, the technical director Shane Saton has resigned, and the career ends with Hugh and Victoria Bendleton.
However, starting with the first bicycle races, it seems that Britain, as always, will reach the highest level in the right time.
The future of the Portland Cup becomes unclear due to the discontinued ambitious contract.
The future of the aluminum cup and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria has become unclear as its main customer energy company has announced the cessation of cooperation.
This statement is based on the plans of the Victoria government to stop the subsidization of the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20 year-long subsidies will be terminated in November.
Therefore, more than 2,000 workplaces in the Alcoa Portland factory are at risk.
Up to 2000 direct and indirect jobs could be threatened.
In addition, it will also have unexpected side effects, as the cup consumes about 10 percent of the entire Victoria power supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry battlefield, which led to the cessation of the power plant in England.
The Alcoa Portland Cup works with losses and can be closed.
These events were caused by several years of speculation on the rise of the Australian dollar value and the cost of factory production.
The factory energy supplier AGL, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroubes Ile, says that the remaining three owners are more likely to terminate their contracts.
The majority of the power plants belong to Alcoa and Alumia joint ventures, as well as parts of the company belong to China’s CITIC and Japan’s Marubeni Corp holding companies.
“AGL hopes to continue the operation of the Portland factory, which would mean a further energy supply quake,” the representative said.
AGL that the contracts are the so-called “risk-restrictive contracts” which are scheduled to enter into force from November 2016.
Contracts have a term of validity of 12 months, so they will be in force until 2017.
“AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in the fiscal year 2017,” the company’s representative said.
Starting from the 2018 fiscal year, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for wholesale electricity prices in the future.
AGL claims that it has already calculated a loss of $187 million in its forecasts, predicting that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa reports that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa’s ability to continue the work of the cup or supply energy to it.
The U.S. company reports that in 2010 it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, but it will be terminated in November.
Analysts have expressed concerns both about the possible closure of the Portland Cup in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago factory near Newcastle, due to the industry’s weak economy.
AGL’s chief executive Steven Michaelson said last week that analysts estimate that Portland will consume 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts of energy during the year.
If both of these plants disappear from the energy market, the energy demand will decrease considerably.
And that would not be good.
The Community Legal Center rejects 160,000 people each year.
More than 160,000 demands are rejected each year, and by reducing the budget, the situation could worsen.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mainly retirees, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who have no means to fight against illegal exile, are refused free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal center, which is already overloaded, warns that with a decrease in funding, the situation will only get worse.
From June next year, these legal centers will receive a 30% less funding than before.
The director of the Queensland Legal Center, James Farel, said that the latest report of the National Legal Center Association reports that right now the legal assistance is rejected to thousands of people in need.
Master Farel pointed out that if this decision is not revoked, then the situation will only get worse.
He also says: "The Queensland Legal Center is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that the aid is rejected to thousands of people who need it."
People trying to end violent relationships, people with profound debts, families experiencing divorce, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the necessary assistance.
From June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 percent, which means that several thousand more Queensland residents will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We urge the Prosecutor General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately stop the reduction of funding so that people in need of legal assistance can get it.
Last year, the government announced its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now it is time to pay attention to the needs of local communities and their customers, and the government of Palazchuk to invest in this important sphere.
Donald Trump's campaign appeal to court because one of his employees threw a firearm
NEW YORK: Donald Trump’s campaign organizers appealed to the court because they did not act after receiving information that the head of North Carolina’s operations would turn a gun against a worker when they were driving in a car in February.
This incident was described in the court's claim, which was submitted to the Charlottes Court on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer.
Bordini said he had been waiting for months to begin the internal trial of the case, but realized that it would not happen.
Leader Earl Philip "racked the pistol, put his right indicator ring on the hole and turned the stone against Vincent's pathway," Bordini says in his complaint.
He also claims that when he filed a complaint to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four more people have experienced the same.
“We don’t have to shoot weapons to cause losses,” Bordini said in his complaint.
Just two days before the case was submitted, a Republican party candidate for the presidency caused a scandal, telling people that "The People of the Second Amendment", i.e. weapons owners and enthusiasts, could act if his cousin Hillary Clinton won the election and she would elect judges.
Trump's campaign representatives said the media had shown his words from the context, and he never urged anyone to violence.
Bordini with his claim wants to drink compensation from the campaign organizers for negligent monitoring, but from Filipsa - for attack, illegal use of weapons and the creation of emotional stress.
Trump’s representative Houpa Hiksa did not immediately comment.
I did not get in touch with Philip.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip has recently left the campaign.
He also failed to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consulting Services".
Republican president candidate Donald Trump has carried out a controversial election campaign.

New tradition - past and sports holidays in the Hull.
On Saturday, the people gathered for the first time for the past and sports holidays.
After 10 years of celebration, this time it was decided that Ezer's celebration will no longer be.
The new page is now reversed.
The day started with sports competitions.
This time the races were not in traditional ways and too seriously taken because, for example, the shooters had to be put to a sleeping goal, the scratch flown, with a man's left hand shot, the "bumping" had not been at all in any Olympic games.
However, each participant could show how strong, brave, profitable and random he is.
After the sports games, everyone gathered in the outdoor street, where the past festivals began.
At that time, the "children's corner" was also working, where the little ones were able to wander into the stunning attractions and get a new image in the grim.
The news, which could also become a tradition, was the truck loans, which took both tractors and motorcycles.
Everyone was spoken by the chief of the administration of the Chulciema Gasta, Inga Kadiķe-Skadiņa, who wanted a nice rest and dry weather, the rain even though raised, but it couldn't disturb a lot.
The celebration continued with the greeting of the youngest people.
It’s really good that the cake has been supplemented with five girls and one girl.
With the presentations to the curlers had arrived amateur art collectives from the Engures County - the viewers very liked the seniors dance group "Rudens ritmi", the presentations of the performers of different peoples of dance "Redas" and young dancers "Golden Pearls".
And it’s not that in the dark scene someone was going to go out.
Of course, the local people and villagers were pleased by the famous actors duo Janis Jarán and Dainis Porgant, who were again Mildiņa Nabiņa and Skaidrīte Kraniņa, as well as the attractive wife of Berzciema from the fishermen's seat "Dieni".
The ball was played by the group "Brugis".
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand the Hithro.
Hytrova will not only promote well-being and growth in the local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Hitler very attractive, as in 2012 in London, where we invested a huge work to make all the regions of the country the winners of the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Real have won an extraordinary amount of the Olympic Games.
And we will do it again by providing local citizens and companies with business opportunities near Hytrov.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put a point to youth unemployment in the Hytrowa neighborhood.
Like the 2012 Olympics in London, there will be people who will think that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Hithrow is too ambitious.
People said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics and that it would be a world-wide outcome.
The skeptics mistaken about 2012 and they will not be right in the Hithrov case as well.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Hithrova has so far overcome everything.
Like the Olympic Games, Hytrova is an infrastructure project that will benefit the whole society, not individuals.
The expansion is a possibility to create up to 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating a ground for both employment and experience at this airport and throughout the UK.
Heathrow is working with a great team that has created a 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment program, including in time and budget, starting with the Terminal 5, which five years from the site was named the best airport terminal in the world and ending with the Terminal 2, which is built between the two most widely used routes in the world.
Now they are ready to create a third stepway, which will be funded by private investments of 16 billion pounds.
The 2012 London Olympics was a great success, and I am sure that it will be the same as Hithrow’s expansion.
It’s time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand the Hitra, ensuring our trade future and creating a new employment environment that the UK could be proud of.
Lord Paul Deaton is a member of the Heathrow Board and former Secretary of Commerce of the Ministry of Economy.
In Switzerland, a woman looks on a highway trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night he went on the road.
Police are trying to find the witnesses of the accident when she was passed through several cars early in the morning on the highway on Thursday.
The accident occurred on Thursday short afternoon on the A1 road near the Morges city of Vo canton.
Vo Canton police reports say that the woman, desperately trying to commit suicide, had gone on the road in the dark, where she was crashed by several cars.
Unclearly trying to kill themselves, the victim, a 49-year-old Switzerland, collapsed several machines, including a heavy machine.
He died in the place of the incident.
Several drivers involved in the accident have already delivered witnesses, but other involved have not yet been identified, the police said, calling for the resignation of the drivers involved and witnesses.
The case has also started a criminal investigation, which in this case is a logical step, the Le Tribune de Geneve edition was commissioned by lawyer Gilles Hofstellers.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the involved drivers will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid the collision?
Hofstellers adds: “This will be determined by the prosecutor.”
Two similar cases that have occurred over the past 5 years indicate that no one of the drivers will be charged.
In both cases, the pedestrian had gone on the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers cannot predict that a pedestrian will be found on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reports.
Last year, a police officer was justified for murder behind negligence when in August 2014, she carried out a man who was sleeping in the middle of the night on A1 road near Paijerna.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim had been drunk and later noticed asleep on the road.
The court concluded that the police officer, who was on the way to the place of the accident, was driving according to the circumstances and the judge admitted that the sleeping man on the road was "completely unexpected and an emergency incident".
Anyone who has information about the incident on Thursday near Morges is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
On the Internet collect signatures for the organization of the competition for the new VID director's post.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" started the collection of signatures for the new competition for the post of chairman of the State Revenue Service (VID).
The petition addressed to the Ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Green and Farmers Union (ZZS) indicates that the public wants a transparent and professional process of appointing officials.
The petition was launched on August 10, and has been signed by 55 people.
The process of nomination of the candidate for the post of Director-General of the VID, Ingas Kollegova, is untransparent and non-professional.
This reminds us of the best traditions of the Soviet Union functionaries.
This discredites the state administration and again causes the public to fail in government and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria, against which all candidates must be assessed," the petition text says.
The author Janis B. pointed out that the public does not know the criteria for the post chosen by Koļegov.
It is also unclear what the candidates intend to work.
The petition indicates that the National Chancellor must establish a new, open competition, in which professional candidates are actively discussed, staff-learning professionals are attracted and a suitable remuneration is offered.
The Minister of Finance Dana Reiznieces-Ozola last week officially appointed the head of the VID, this week the government was planned to approve him in the new position, but all the ministers of the party "Unity" voted against, so the question for a week was delayed.
If we lost, we played badly.
Pludmale volley players Aleksandr Samoilov and Janis Šmēdiņš hoped on honor at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, however, unto it, there is no difference where to finish the competition, after leaving the tournament said Samoilov.
One of the world’s strongest beach volleyball couples on Thursday in the final and decisive match of the subgroup tournament with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost the Brazilians Evandru Gonsalveš Oliveir and Pedru Solberg Salgadu, ending their participation in the four-year’s most important sports forum.
In three subgroup matches, the Latvian athletes won one win, but the same relationship was for two more couples.
The following was counted by the three pair's small-point relationship, which after this match's convincing loss was the most disadvantaged to the Latvian duet.
“In the first seat we were in leadership, but from 16:15 we also stayed at 16 points,” the game continued.
I don’t even know how in the rest of the set we stayed without points.
This is not to play.
After that in the second set everything was in order and in the set end managed to break the game, in addition, it had to be a good basis for the third set.
We started the same way, but after we mixed the sides, the result grew for only one team.
We had too many errors in the attack.
In the subgroup, all the teams were similar, almost all the matches had three sets, so small points were important.
"We had to play more similarly, rather than repeatedly giving 3-4 points in a row," the athlete said.
We knew that Evander could be admired.
“In the first set we met it, in the second we entered 1-2 points, and in the third at +4 he had already gone to play,” he recalled.
We tried to show the best game.
For a moment not, for a moment not.
I did not see the situation before the match, but it was known that we needed as many points as possible.
“If we lost, then I played badly,” Samoilov said.
From Evander we expected a good servant and with it in the first sets we also quite well dealt with, but in the third he opened the servant and it was difficult to build an attack.
In turn, I made a lot of mistakes in the reception directly to the Pedr serves, but it had to be dealt with.
Samoilov said that unlike the previous match, today the athletes were not nervous.
"We walked, we played, we also defended, but we needed a better serving reception," the athlete said.
“They played well, and at the end they got on the rally.”
Before the tournament we said immediately that the exhibition was the most uncomfortable as it could be.
We had a chance to fight for the first place, but we were not even out of the group.
“All of us were waiting for a medal and we were from ourselves, but after that there is no difference – 25th or fourth,” Samoilov said, who predicted that the duet will continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no question and we will continue to play together because this is just one tournament.
Samoilov was already the third in his career at the Olympic Games, since in 2008 he started in Beijing with Martyn Plovin, but four years ago he played in London with Ruslan Sorokin.
This was the second start at the Olympics.
Latvenergo follows the opening process of the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company "Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market from both the consumer and the potential trader's positions, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether in the future Latvenergo will join the gas market as a trader will be determined by what the gas market model and legal framework will be established."
“Therefore, on our part, we are actively involved in the drafting and commenting of legislation, and we also submit our proposals,” Bidere said.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (EM) in cooperation with the Public Services Regulation Commission and the Energy Company "Latvijas Gaza" has developed the Ministry's Cabinet Rules Project "Rules of Commerce and Use of Natural Gas" which will change the existing principles of operation of the natural gas market, from April 3, 2017, providing natural gas users with the right to choose the natural gas merchant freely.
Working on the new natural gas market regulation, EM aims to make the natural gas trading process as simple as possible and understandable to the user.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution, the "trader's central model" is chosen, in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one account and one information and customer service site, leaving the natural gas distribution system technical issues in terms of the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity trade.
We remind that household users are expected to gradually open the market – even after April 3, 2017, those household users who do not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming connected users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is set to the public merchant," the ministry informed.
On the other hand, traders will have to choose a natural gas trader with whom they must conclude a natural gas trade agreement.
For a period of time for the conclusion of a natural gas trading agreement, the natural gas trading will be provided by the current natural gas trader at the fixed price.
The Ministry’s Cabinet Regulations draft detailed the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules establish the procedure for the delivery and termination of natural gas to users, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the merchant, the public merchant, the system operator, the user and the owner of the gased object in the supply and use of natural gas; the procedure for the calculation of the received services, the interest rate of delay, the procedure for the change of traders and the supply of users in the event of disruption in the supply of natural gas; the procedure for the supply of natural gas to the connected users by the public merchant.

Oil prices continue to rise; stock exchanges in the U.S. and Europe, as well as the value of the U.S. dollar are rising.
Oil prices in the world continue to rise on Friday morning, having a positive impact on investors' mood on the statements of Saudi Arabia's oil minister, which strengthens the expectations that the largest oil producers will take action in the OPEC meeting in September to stabilize the world's oil market.
The three main U.S. stock exchanges on Thursday reached a record level that has not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor on the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial indicators of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial figures of several companies on Thursday also led to the rise in European stock exchanges.
The value of the U.S. dollar rose on Thursday against the euro, against the British pound and against the Japanese yen.
In the New York Stock Exchange Electronic Commerce, the WTI brand crude oil price for supplies in September rose on Thursday from $1.78 to $43.49 per barrel.

The conserve manufacturer "Blue Lagoon" sales dropped by 33.8 percent last year.
The conserve manufacturer "Blue Lagoon"'s turnover last year was 4,202 million euros, which is 33.8% less than a year ago, while the company's losses decreased 5.7 times - to 904.7 thousand euros, according to the annual financial report published in the Lursoft database.
The company’s management report states that in 2015 the company worked with losses caused by a number of reasons, including due to the constant lack of available funds caused by the Unicredit Bank’s withdrawal from the Baltic market, terminating the previously existing credit line, and leaving the Blue Lagoon with concluded contracts unable to fulfill them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient funds to buy cheaper raw materials in large amounts and receive a volume discount.
The bank’s withdrawal from the Latvian market also banned the company from implementing EU structural funds support projects that would allow the factory to purchase new manufacturing equipment and modernize the infrastructure.
The company’s financial creators were also negatively affected by the rise in raw materials prices and the customer’s refusal to pay more than the company’s products.
"Only in the second half of July 2016, customers recognized price changes and were ready to buy goods at the new - highest - prices," the company's management says.
Also in 2015, the Blue Lagoon began talks with potential investors, including the assessment of the company’s moving and real estate assets.
Investors have already been with the company's largest creditors "Unicredit Leasing", where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s activities and development were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan started in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimization of technological processes, which enables greater productivity and capacity.
"A number of equipment has been purchased to ensure greater production speed," the company's management said.
The management of the "Blue Lagoon" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's factory to fulfill orders that have not been possible so far.
The first production set, which will be produced on this equipment, will be ready in August.
Since the intention protocols for the sale of the product have already been signed, all produced will be sold in accordance with the intention protocols.
The new product will increase its turnover by about 300 thousand euros a month,” the company’s management said.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq in August 2016.
The Blue Lagoon has sent its first experimental container to Israel in 2016, expanding the shipping market to Cyprus and will sign a cooperation agreement with a new wholesale chain in the United States in September this year.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, the Blue Lagoon worked with a turnover of EUR 6,347 million and losses of EUR 5,113 million.
The Blue Lagoon was founded in 1997 and its capital is 1,156 million euros.
The company is owned by two Latvian individuals – Mikhail Kaidanov (89.11%) and Igor Shirson (10.89%).

Because of the neighbor's repair, the man is on a broken roof and forced to leave the house.
The LTV broadcast "4th study" addressed Dmitry Saidyachev, whose neighbor began capital repairs in his apartment, and since that time Dmitry from the roofs is drowned and there is no certainty that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors carried out a voluntary construction and the roofs in my apartment have been damaged.
Then I informed Riga’s building board, the house manager and other organizations.
The building administration said that we are not an operational service and we have no expert.
“The owner of the apartment must go to the Latvian Union of Engineers, and there will be some expert from there,” says Dmitry.
The invited expert arrived, fixed what happened and admitted that the cover was in a disadvantaged state.
However, a month has passed since the first Dmitry's application to the construction department, and until the beginning of this week no one was able to answer whether the location in the apartment is not life-threatening.
The building said - that's the legislation, wait, if you're not satisfied, write to everyone in a row.
“Then I wrote to the Riga House, but they sent the house to the manager, then the house manager again to the building board, and then there’s a dirty way,” says Dmitry.
After examining all the paper cuts, it is clear that the construction work is stopped, although at any time you can hear that someone works there.
In the next two months the expertise must be carried out and in the next six months the owner of the apartment that carries out repairs, all these defects must be removed.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the construction management considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal shell in this carrier structure is affected, therefore there is no certainty that the owner of the lower apartment is threatened.
"Therefore we have requested additional explanation from this expert," says Riga City Construction Board representative Ilze Žūka.
Despite the prohibition of carrying out any repairs in the upper apartment, from there it is still heard that the construction will continue.
The penalty for voluntary construction without a building permit is from 70 to 700 euros, but in a particular case the penalty may be much more expensive.
While waiting for the expert's opinion, the building board has made a decision that both apartments should not be operated - both in which the construction works are carried out and Dmitry's apartments.
"This is in the construction practice not the case when in this way their ignorance or simply unwillingness the citizens, possibly, created a threat not only to their own property, but also to the owner of the underlying property, as a result this owner cannot exploit their property," says the representative of the building.
Now Dmitry remains looking for another place to live - with relatives, friends, in a hotel or rent another apartment.
But the damages that may be caused by Dmitry may try to burn from a neighbor in civil law, which may take a lot of time.
Due to voluntary construction, staying in both apartments is currently prohibited until the building engineer gives its closure, and it may have to wait even three weeks.
The damages will be paid to the owner of the apartment in which the repair was carried out.
The owner of this apartment is also threatened to a prison sentence of up to six months for failing to take into account the statements of the building.
Think of now!

The transformation of the former Chemer sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The transformation of the former Chemer sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Chemeri" will cost 22 million euros, the agency LETA tells the representative of the future hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel Chemeri" Gita Želve.
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage of the renovation of the former sanatorium.
The second phase will be the “wellness” clinic, which is scheduled to open in 2022, while the hotel is scheduled to open in May 2018.
The jelly notes that the exact costs of the clinic are not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be found in the building of the former Chemer resort polyclinics, with an area of approximately 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be placed in three floors.
"Park Hotel Kemeri" and the owner of the planned clinic is the international fund "G Capital Europe", which invests in European assets.
"G Capital Europe" owners are a number of investors who invest money in this fund, notes Želve.

As, the historic sanatorium complex "Kemeri" is planned to build a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Kemeri" and "wellness" or wellness clinic.
However, the reconstruction lasted.
On the other hand, in the 2010 review it was also claimed that "Ominasis" regularly communicates with the hotel operator "Kempinski", which continues to provide daily technical controls in the sanatorium "Kemeri", and already in 2011 will definitely meet "finished future hotel "Kemeri" reconstruction" and immediately starts the preparation work for the opening of the hotel chain "Kempinski".
In October 2014, the Park Hotel Kemeri confirmed its willingness to purchase the unpaid "Ominasis Latvia" owned chemical sanatorium assets at the auction, but a month later the expulsion was recognised as untouchable because the winner did not pay for the purchase at the time specified.
The sale price was determined according to the initial price of the last untouched auction - 2.86 million euros.
As the agency LETA informed the city’s representative Ieva Aile, the municipality, signing the protocol, confirmed that with the support of the co-financing of the European Union structural funds, the upcoming infrastructure will be arranged – the historic Kemer Park will be restored, an interactive natural tourist facility will be established, roads and parking places will be arranged.

McCartney: The presence of Joko Ono threatened the Beatles.
Paul McCartney acknowledged that the presence of Joko Ono created a sense of threat to the legendary band The Beatles.
The 74-year-old hand star currentlyins a "good" relationship with John Lennon's cousin, but during the time she went to the group to visit the record in the studio, McCartney was scared because Ono was the only woman among the group members - George Harrison, Ringo Star, Lennon and McCartney.
When the singer was asked about the two relationships, he replied to the Rolling Stone magazine: "These are really good."
We felt in danger at that time.
While we recorded, she sat on the amplifiers.
Most people couldn’t tolerate it.
We could, but not quite successfully, because we were very stressed.
We were not sexists, but the girls usually didn’t go to the recording studio, she allowed us to work.
When John began to meet Joko, he was not sitting in the control room, but in the middle of our four.
The creator of the Yellow Submarine also acknowledged that he now regularly communicates with the former group member Ringo, and from time to time approves the recording studio Apple's work plans, but all otherwise The Beatles are "out of work".
Asked whether he’s still meeting with the other only still living member of the legendary rock group, McCartney told the magazine Rolling Stone, “Sometimes no.”
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don’t go to the meetings, I feel a little off of it.
I left Apple during a heavy divorce.
In my place, I sent John Eastman to meetings and said, "Let me know what everyone says, because I can't suffer sitting at that table."
It was too painful, as if he saw his pet dying.
The company is now working in such a way that I will just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venus has once been a habitable planet.
Scientists from the Godard Space Research Institute of NASA have developed a model to explore the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that are also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, whose surface is hot, where there is no water and whose atmosphere consists almost merely of carbon, there have ever been conditions similar to Earth.
Scientists have previously stated that the Venus’ slow rotation rate is explained by a tight atmosphere.
But the latest simulations show that Venus once had a plane, Earth-like atmosphere, and it turned slowly.
The model also looks at the previous topography of Venus.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on the Earth, but there was enough water and geographical diversity on it to form life and prevent the vomiting of water.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In the GISS model simulation, the Venus cutting model reveals that the bright part of the day on it lasts for 2 months, the GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This process heats the planet’s surface and causes things, which in turn form thick cloud layers that act as a rainguard, protecting the planet from the heat of the Sun.
As a result, a moderate climate temperature is formed, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it was once habitable, over several billion years, Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet rays.
Its oceans were burning, and the lengths were burned by ultraviolet rays.
When the water was completely washed, only a thin carbon dioxide atmosphere with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venus, as we know it today.
Scientists have published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from the role of Avalanche coach
On Thursday, Colorado "Avalanche" coach and vice president of hockey operations, Patrick Roy, filed a complaint, as a reason to mention the insufficient impact on the decision-making process of the team.
Colorado's vice president and general manager Joe Sakik confirmed the news and announced that the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
“In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President of the Colorado Club’s Hockey Operations energetically, enthusiastically and objectively,” the 50-year-old said in a statement.
During this summer, I thought a lot about how I could improve the performance of the team to give it the brightness needed and higher levels of results.
To this, the visions of the Vice-President of the Main Trainer and Hockey Operations must be fully consistent with the visions of the organization.
He must also be able to influence decisions related to the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Takir, who gave Roj on May 23, 2013, thanked Roj for his contribution to the team.
He said that Patrick was informed of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognised as the best coach of the league and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and the first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the exclusion games the Colorado team was overcome by Minnesota hockey players.
Avalanche ended the 2015-2016 season with a score of 39-39-4 and remained five points behind the Wild team without receiving a second special invitation from the Western Conference organizers.
The famous drug gate guard Roy won four Stenli Cups in his career - two with Monreal "Canadiens" and two with Avalanche.
Northern oil platform workers resume negotiations and stop strike
Workers’ strikes on the remuneration of Northern oil platform workers have been delayed because the two parties in the dispute have repeated negotiations, talks leaders.
There are periodic strikes against the oil processing company Wood Group on the North Sea oil platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
The joint statement states that Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions agreed to resume negotiations on the resolution of the dispute.
Several full-day meetings are scheduled for the next few weeks, which will begin at the beginning of the next week with the aim of re-examining the problematic issues.
The trade unions that their recent actions, organized after more than 25 years of interruption, are aimed at a planned 30 percent reduction in wages.
Due to the negative market pressure, Wood Group reduced the wages of North Sea workers by 9 percent this year.
Since 2014, the company has reduced land workers’ wages by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage reductions would allow the company to survive market declines.
Shell has already reduced wages to thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries in order to optimize its work by preparing a large-scale merger deal with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies feel pressure due to the falling oil prices, and the situation will be more complicated by the UK’s decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Scottish Parliamentary Deputy Dave Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said the North Sea is vital for the region’s economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone, not individuals.
In 2016, it is planned to invest $1.4 billion in new North Sea projects, compared to $7 billion invested over the past five years.

The latest Kepler telescope mission has helped astronomers to collect the most comprehensive catalogue of the star's rotation speed in the Playout star.
New data helps astronomers understand why the stars in this star rotate at different speeds, as well as how the rotation rate of the stars is related to the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will get more information about the link between the star’s mass, age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebula, a scientist at Pasadena Caltech’s Infrared Process and Analysis Center.
The Pleiadian star is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in this star just begin to grow, reaching an age of about 125 million years.
They turn at maximum speed.
Riding at the maximum speed, these growing stars emit a large number of star winds.
When the waves get into the magnetic field of the stars, they remove the stars.
When the stars move, their rotation rate decreases.
Kepler measured the rotation rate of each star by determining the time between the appearance of recognizable stars, such as the sunlight.
The latest rotating speed catalogue shows that larger stars rotate slower than smaller stars.
The rebel compares the stars to the dancers, the larger dancers make the piruetes slower than the small dancers.
The rebel tells that in the "ballet" of the Pleiade it is visible that the slow-rotating objects are larger and more massive, while the faster-rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the fact that the Playa Star is so close, it serves as a great space laboratory where you can compare the characteristics of the stars with the rotation speeds.
The Rebel tells that the Pleiadian Star helps to build theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why the star's rotation rate will slow down and about their complete stop process.
The rebellion and his colleagues detailed the analysis of the rise rate of the Pleiadian stars in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
