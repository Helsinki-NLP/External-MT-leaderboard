Welsh MPs are worried they'll look like Muppets.
Some Assembly Members (AM) have been dismayed by the proposal that they may in future be referred to as Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This was due to plans to rename the House of Commons as the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the House of Representatives from all political spectrums are concerned that they could become the subject of a public service announcement.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned that the name rymes to p and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means fool, and pwp means coward.
A Welsh Plaid Cymru MP said the group as a whole was more satisfied and suggested alternative solutions.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was open to a name change, but that the MWP could quickly turn into a Muppet in a speech.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The House Committee, which is currently preparing a bill to introduce the name change, has announced the following:
The Welsh Government's 2017 Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals which received broad support for the change of the name of the councils to the Welsh Parliament.
The Committee was inclined to call the members of the Welsh Parliament or MWPs, but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
House members are proposing alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could bring headaches to House Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill to amend the bill within weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the disqualification of Assembly members and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the bill, the House of Representatives will have a decisive vote on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents the acquisition of Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the initiation of its accession process to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Giorgi Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, has said he will not recognize the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's have rung as the churches in Harlem struggle to survive
"The older people I spoke to said that in the past a bar and a church could be found on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
There's no one else today.
He said the bar disappearance was understandable.
"People today are socializing in a different way", he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people live regularly".
As for the churches, he was concerned that the money from the sale of property would not last as long as the church leaders thought and sooner or later would be found again at the beginning.
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments for people who would not help the other churches in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and so the day will come sooner when these churches will be closed completely because it is unlikely that residents who move into these apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis  Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A black congregation holding worship nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by the Black Congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson at the head who also led a boycott of merchants at the 125th Street Mall, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the hiring or promotion of blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but since the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a series of bells, called a carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "Poor People's Bells".
The expert who played the carillon in July used another name: cultural treasure and incompatible historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the world's first carillon to feature the black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing the big carillon at Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story of architects and builders, some of whom have been brought in by lay church leaders and others by bishops.
The Sacré-Cœur, the parish's governing body made up of lay people, wrote to the disciples in July, concerned that the disciples would be forced to transfer the costs to the Sacré-Cœur, although the Sacré-Cœur was not involved in hiring the architects and builders sent by the disciples.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A stray dog injured a 13-year-old while diving for a paddle in California
According to a statement, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was scuba diving in California on the opening day of the hunting season.
The attack happened just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then drove the group to the scene to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought it was the excitement of the locust, but then he realized that he was screaming, "It bit me!"
He bit me!
Hammel said that when he approached the boy he noticed that his entire skeleton had been torn.
"I made sure everyone got out of the water. "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of seahorse responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles told a news conference that the shark was spotted in the area weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities have shut down access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swamija in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and ensure the safety of the bathers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is becoming a competitor to chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing beauty desks in the style of department stores and engaging specialized vendors.
As part of the large UK beauty market entry of GBP 2,8 billion, which continues to grow in line with falling sales in the clothing and home appliances market, larger cosmetics desks will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year if successful.
Investing in cosmetics is one way supermarkets are trying to take advantage of the shelf space that was once reserved for TVs, microwave ovens, and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing range of companies L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space with areas for certain brands like stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also launching its Boutique range of decorative cosmetics, so most products will be vegan-friendly, and that's what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, the fragrance shop will make a pilot use of the concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second to open in Selly Oaks, Birmingham later this year.
Networking and returning to the daily shopping of small quantities of food at local grocery stores means that supermarkets must do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's CEO, said that outlets will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to resist more lucrative stores like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets to hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitat's departments, having bought both chains two years ago, allegedly spurring grocery sales and making those acquisitions more profitable.
Previously, the supermarket's attempt to refresh its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but this ended in a dispute over the distribution of pharmacy revenue in its supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business at 281 Celcius, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
It claims that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering a range of luxury skincare products in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide a more comfortable environment for our customers.
We also invested in special training for colleagues who would be at the customer's side and give them advice.
Our range of branded products is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby resigned from her £11 million contract.
Star of the show Dragon's Den Peter Jones left to take a break from his anger after TV host Holly Willoughby resigned from his £11 million trademark deal to focus on his new deals with the Marks & Spencer and ITV retail chains
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of homewear and fashion accessories Truly.
Their trademark has been compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow trademark.
The host of This Morning (37) on Instagram announced she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragon's Den Peter Jones to cook with rage by withdrawing at the last minute from a joint profitable business to focus on her new brilliant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources claim Jones was furious when the television girl of gold during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their brand of homewear and fashion accessories Truly.
That business was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and was to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of her vacation homes.
The source stated, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would secure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to retire has shocked everyone involved in this business.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to starting the entire line.
At Marlow's headquarters, there's a lot of warehouse goods that's ready to sell.
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars to invest in, could cost the company millions of dollars because of large investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewares and possible additional delays in the line.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close friends with Jones and his wife, Tar Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as chairman of the board in March.
Couples are spending their holidays together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business activities".
♪ Hard negotiations, and then we fell in love ♪
He was joking about the criticism he would get in the papers for comments that some might consider unworthy of the president and for his so positive attitude toward the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give so many concessions?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
I didn't give up on anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks are stuck.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korean chief diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North had not noticed the "appropriate reaction" of the United States to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that instead the US has not yet lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech at the rally.
We're doing great with North Korea, he said.
He threatened war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had been successful -- halting missile test launches, helping to free hostages, and returning the remaining American troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people waiting in front of this crowded arena for the entrance, we would have about 200 people there, Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, it has not been declared a national disaster, a condition for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not seeking international assistance, so it's all a bit problematic", Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palma, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the Office for National Disasters, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paluu to see if international agencies would be allowed to participate in relief efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, this country is still sadly unprepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not common in other parts of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palua, although the warning was in effect, likely contributed to the loss of life.
And at best, traveling between the many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is on its way to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Improving Indonesia's decaying structure was the foundation of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the government under Joko is struggling with a lack of funding, and next year there are new elections.
Joko is also facing the pressure of the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored a goal in the draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an extra from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal in a 1-0 win over Chelsea.
He moved the ball to his left foot before he kicked it into the opposite stance.
The ball flew high above the naked towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped Cape Arrizabalaga who jumped at it and entered the net.
"It was demanding to get in that position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once.
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after the Belgian star Eden Hazard hit in the 25th minute.
The blue forward passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic during that game before turning around somewhere in the middle of the field and hitting Liverpool's half.
The quarterback made a quick addition in the middle of the field.
Then he threw a beautiful passing ball that led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and hit the left foot in the net on the opposite stall next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool play a club competition match against Napoli in the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are expecting a video of the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the state disaster office said early Sunday morning.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that a large number of people were reported trapped in the building's rubble after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake felt on Friday that caused waves as high as 6 meters.
The city of Palú, with a population of more than 380,000, is filled with the remains of demolished buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called the people in the area to report if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hogan said: "The investigation is still in its infancy, but I would like to be contacted by anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken a video of something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is critical to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the building.
Friends who think they know this woman arrived on the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they're also in the process of informing the victim's immediate family.
A cab driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
Residents have now been told it will be a few hours before they can return to their homes.
The officer reportedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up at the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's so scary".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the fenced area, and another was parked just outside.
A large number of police officers were standing inside the fenced area and monitoring the housing block.
All those with any information are requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, by reference to minutes 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument to be found in the midst of a debate about the "breaking of history".
His persecution would be poetic justice for the near-Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt a stupidity and an attempt to destroy history.
John Goldsmit, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that the character of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become the subject of debate.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars is not something Cromwell ordered or carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful revival of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the 19th-century way of thinking and a part of the historiography of a person many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, to be the defender of parliament from external pressure.
Whether this view is entirely credible is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual identifiable figure representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are still worthy of honour and commemoration.
A pig killer killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwestern China.
A man named only by his surname Yuan was found dead with severed arteries and covered in blood near a parking lot in a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, the Morning Post of southern China reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to inoculate pigs in pigs on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, a cousin found him dead, and the door to the neighbor's pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a 200-pound pig bit the grower to death.
The evening news from Guiyang reports that a cousin named Wu stated: My cousin's legs were bloody and paralyzed.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent another person from attacking while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the marketplace administration are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this is rare, pig attacks on humans have been recorded before.
A pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts in 2016, and the husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had grabbed a Welsh farmer by the tractor while his wife was driving the animal away.
After pigs ate farmers in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a killer.
They're just playing games.
They're grumpy, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
All they need to do is show respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are bringing heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it crosses the colder waters of northern Mexico.
But Rosa will bring floodwaters to the northern Mexico and southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. eastern time, and was located 620 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa's expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is being created above the Pacific and moving toward the West Coast of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture will interact with an approaching low-pressure area causing heavy rainfall over much of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rainfall will cause dangerous buoyant flooding, muddy shoals and possible desert landslides.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause rainfall of approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, particularly parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona, are expected to experience as much as 25 to 100 millimeters of rain.
Bountiful flooding is possible with rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
There is no way to walk into the desert because of the danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain could turn canyons into wild rivers, and thunderstorms with thunderstorms will bring local storm winds and dust hail.
Approaching the low-pressure area will bring local heavy rains to parts of the coast of Southern California.
The potential for falls of more than 12 mm may result in less muddy bumps and sloping roads.
It will be the first rainfall in the wet season in this region.
Scattered tropical vortices will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning before closing in late Monday and covering a wider area on Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the border areas of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah on Tuesday and last all day on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature changes are possible across the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will continue to rise and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to be 27 degrees Celsius in early October from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high possibility of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched the audition of Bret Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people on Thursday watched six television networks the tense testimony of Supreme Court nominees Bret Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political countdown continued, and reporters interrupted the regular program to announce the last-minute turnaround that Friday: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a single investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh was beating her up drunk and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh testified in a fervent statement that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
Friday's hearing was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, a number cited in the Nielsen report.
The company averaged viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of people who watch content in their offices.
To make it more appealing, it's about an audience that is similar in numbers to the one watching American football or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose studio guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest viewership with an average of 5.69 million during the all-day audition, Nielsen reported.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in a drama that was set on Friday.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded him screaming at protesters on Friday morning as he attempted to ride an elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood in disgraced gaze for several minutes as the protesters sat down in front of CNN cameras and smeared him with contempt.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?
They said to him, "You have power while so many women are helpless".
Flake said his office released a statement before the elevator doors closed that he would say more at the board hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks were watching live as the Judiciary Committee was scheduled to vote to send Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote in the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the candidate within the next week, which Democrats in the minority demanded.
Flakea was partially persuaded by a conversation with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of playing politics with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing politics with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in a second interview with her in the same issue on the cover continued to criticize her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that the UK and the EU should charge each other customs duties was "total nonsense".
Wayde Sims murder: police arrested Dytheon Simpson suspected of killing an LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and detained on suspicion of manslaughter, Baton Rouge Police said.
Officials released a video of the Sims-Simpson fight, and police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and announced they found Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB, a CBS affiliate, reported.
After Simpson was questioned, police announced that he confessed to shooting and killing Wayde.
A $350,000 bail was requested.
The East Baton Rouge County coroner's office on Friday released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police department thanks the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, Southern University Police Department and local residents for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for enforcing the law on the alienation and the search for truth.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-1, 200-pound wide receiver grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was devastated and shocked by Wayde's death.
"That's what we're always worried about", Wade said.
The volcano is throwing ash at Mexico City
The ash that is ejecting the volcano Popocatapetl has reached the southern parts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after ramping up activity in the crater and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The center has been following multiple shake-ups and tremors.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash on windshields of cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity from a volcano 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in 2017 shook central Mexico.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clash between police and Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police and thousands joined counter-demonstrations to mark Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists, apologized for the intervention police, began throwing eggs and paint at police officers, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
The fighting continued later in the day when police used clubs to calm the fight.
For several hours, independence groups chanted "No forgetfulness, no forgiveness", and unionists shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were hospitalized for minor injuries sustained during the demonstration, the local press reported.
Tensions in the region's striving for independence have not eased for even a year after the October 1 referendum that Madrid declared illegal, which Catalan separatists celebrate.
A large majority of voters voted for independence, although turnout was low because those who opposed secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups spent Friday night on the streets to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
Demonstrations were held, but the demonstrators were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who witnessed separatist demonstrations with his wife, said he no longer hopes Catalonia will gain independence.
Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness that they could vote, but now we're stuck, he said.
Despite achieving a key, albeit narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have been unable to sustain momentum this year because their most prominent leaders are in self-imposed exile or detention awaiting trial for their role in organising referendums and subsequent declarations of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the clash was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in detention since late last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way we can make known the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men after car-crashing into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after they hit a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident occurred Thursday at approximately 7:30 P.M. BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the front door and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point a car was hit by a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Menge's strike brought Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menge's first goal for Livingston brought a win.
The new Scottish Premiership club Livingston surprised Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his only second defeat in 18 games at the club's home ground at Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Menge's hit proved decisive as Gary Holt's team settled with the Iberia in a second.
Gerrard's team is still undefeated in the Premier League this season, and next Saturday they play Heart, the league's leading eight-point back-to-back.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
Livingston has meanwhile increased his winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt has yet to experience a loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed an opportunity against the deceased guests.
Holt's team was supposed to lead before they even got that hit, given that their straightforwardness in the attack caused a whole host of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but it was a bump on the way to the goal, and after that Alan Lithgow could only move the ball wide after he slipped to intercept a blow to Craig Halkett's head towards the goal.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause trouble for the guests
And that's how the key goal was scored.
The Rangers failed to stop the free kick, and Livingston devised the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson together assisting Mang who hit the middle of the field.
By that point, the Rangers had mostly control of the ball, but they faced a tough home defense, so goalie Liam Kelly was mostly out of business.
This continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the shot.
Rangers goalie Allan McGregor's legs were slit to Scott Pittman, and Lithgow made a wide-ranging blow from another organized attack by Livingston.
Long addition failed to cross Livingston's goal line, and two eleven-man fights with replacement Glen Middleton and one hand-to-hand were not completed.
"Great" by Livingston "analysis of the
Alasdar Lamont of the Scottish BBC at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great play and a result by Livingston.
All to one were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on that entryway.
Their style of play and staff have barely changed since their return to the big clubs, but great credit goes to Holt and the way he's united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at leading a highly organized defense, and Meng kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall out of the game.
But the Rangers were short of inspiration.
They were far from the standard they set by playing well under Gerrard.
They just opened a hole in the home team once, and it's kind of a call to fight for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan was greeted with mixed feelings in Koelna
On Saturday, September 29, there was a lot of smiles under the clear skies when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany  aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to ensure that the EU and Turkey are able to participate in the negotiations.
Erdogan then headed to Koeln to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police blocked a crowd of 25,000 people outside the mosque for security reasons, but a large number of presidential supporters appeared nearby to see it.
And hundreds of protesters against Erdogan's opponent, including a large number of Kurds, raised their voices condemning Erdogan's policies and the decision by the German government to welcome him to the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the divisiveness of a visitor who some Germans praise as a hero and others attack as an autocrat.
Road crash in Deptford: Motorcyclist killed in a car crash
A cyclist was fatally injured in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 P.M.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The collision occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed after a hit-and-run driver from the crash site on Chiders Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash site.
City police said police officers are trying to identify the man and inform his immediate family.
The roadways have been closed and buses have been diverted, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
The prison administration said six police officers were injured in the riots at the man's prison.
The riots broke out at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special Tornado troops were brought in to quell the unrest involving eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers on the scene were treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been hired to handle the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members received medical attention for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that all those responsible will be turned over to the police and that they can spend longer in jail.
Long Lartin Prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison administrator ended up in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the police were called to the prison to solve a serious situation where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (possible benefit to dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but it is likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa moves through the desert southwest with its remaining force and threatens flash flooding.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued a flood warning for Monday and Tuesday in areas from western Arizona, through southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should approach Phoenix late Monday in the rain and cross right over it on Tuesday.
The Phoenix National Hydrometeorological Service tweeted that  since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have brought tropical storm or depression within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) has passed 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center model predicts 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 150 mm on the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest including Stjenjak and the Great Basin, there is a likelihood of precipitation of 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated total amounts up to 100 mm.
For those outside the danger of the floodwaters, Rosa could come as a lifesaver because the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a major threat, some of these precipitation could be beneficial because the southwest is currently drought-prone.
According to the U.S. map of drylands, just over 40 percent of Arizona has been hit by at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, weather.com reported.
The hurricane's path first approached the shores along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa was still a powerful hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour and was 620 miles (620 km) south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 20 miles per hour.
The storm hit the cooler waters of the Pacific and weakened.
So the force of a tropical storm is expected to approach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico could pose a significant flood risk.
The total amount of rainfall expected in the area from the Baja California peninsula to northwestern Sonora is 75 to 150 mm, with a possible maximum of 250 mm, weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
The main threat to Rose or her remains is heavy rainfall in the Bay Area, northwestern Sonora and the American Desert Southwest, the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening flooding and mudslides in the deserts and mountain landscapes.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
Around 4:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, an injured teenager was found.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstocka area.
Police have called in anyone with a recording of the incident.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh has suffered the wrath and anger of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a pre-election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump has stated that Kavanaugh suffered the wrath and anger of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanauh testified before Congress on Thursday and decisively and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's accusations of sexual assault decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing on the charge she made.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"The confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the confirmation vote for one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service", he told a gathering of supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nomination as he talked about the importance of Republicans running for office in the middle of the presidential term.
Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I am, he said.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere.
Trump has argued that the mission of the Democrats is to create resistance and obstruction.
A Republican aide told CNN that the first crucial procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed, many of them by massive waves that hit the coastline when a major earthquake and tsunami struck Sulawesi, an Indonesian island.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palá on Friday when at dusk waves of up to six metres [6.5 ft] hit the shore, dragging many to their deaths and wreaking everything in their path.
The tsunami followed after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately run and died", said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian BNPB disaster relief agency, at a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it pulled cars, debris, houses, hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
"Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived", he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palou.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent strikes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was twice the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical location of the city at the end of a long and narrow bay may have increased the tsunami's intensity.
Nugroho described the damage as extensive and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were demolished.
He also said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were reported missing.
According to Nugro, the casualties and damage may be higher along the coast 300 km north of Palua, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
 Communications are completely cut off and we have no information from Donggal.
"More than 300,000 people live in the area", says the Red Cross statement, adding that staff and volunteers have gone to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse", the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for not divulging reports that the tsunami hit Paul, although officials claim the waves came as soon as the warning was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media can be heard as a man on the top floor of a building panics to warn people down the street of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall collapsed on the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that caused communications to be cut off around Palua, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Authorities say cargo planes have begun to arrive from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still need food and other necessities.
The city airport has reopened for humanitarian purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Paluu on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia claimed more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"While World Vision staff from Donggala have successfully arrived in the city of Pallas where employees were being moved into tarpaulin tents set up in their office yard, they have transmitted the scenes of destruction on the way", said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a number of destroyed houses", he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although aid groups have launched disaster relief wheels, some have argued that foreign aid workers with great expertise have been prevented from coming to Pala.
The Indonesian authorities have not yet established a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level", said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can get international aid, but that's not declared yet.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit Pal on Friday night, the friends and families of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be among those miracles that mitigate the dark scenarios of natural disasters.
A little boy was rescued from the sewer on Saturday.
On Saturday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, was training two missing paragliders for the Asian Games earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped at the Ro Ro Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his disciples.
"Given the many years I've spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the Ro Ro Hotel's demolition spread to the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors from Palua who were attending the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a grey claw instead of two blue claw.
"I think that means the messages haven't been delivered", he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while loading ATMs in downtown Newport on the Levee.
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who filled an ATM in downtown Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
Detective Dennis McCarthy's statement says the driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy doing that, another man in the race came behind Brink's back and stole a bag of money to put in an ATM.
Witnesses have spotted multiple suspects fleeing the scene, but police have not released the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
In a Twitter post on Saturday announcing the change, he wrote the following: "Live will be officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
The show's writers said he replaced singer Ariana Grande who cancelled the show for emotional reasons.
Besides being a shortened form of his current stage name, West has previously stated that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I think ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ti", West said earlier this year in a talk about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So, I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
It's from Kanye, which means "one", to just Ye, it's a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are.
He's one of a number of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And West's former associate, JAY-Z, was playing with the stripped-down versions of his name and the stripped-down one in capital letters.
Mexican AMLO has promised not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against his citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody student vengeance.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square promised he would never use an army against the Mexican people.
Military troops opened fire during peaceful demonstrations on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as leftist student movements began to spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly support to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education attracted young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double its investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its investment in research in the field, said AI investor and expert in the field Kai Fu Leeu, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment followed after various parts of the US government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although the US lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence in principle.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: By 2030, it aims to become the number one country in AI innovation.
"Double-increasing the budget for AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the United States and we're looking for the next big discovery in AI", Lee said.
"Doubling investment could double the chance of the next big AI breakthrough coming to the United States", Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book, AI Magnificence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the best American game player, Othello, and later he was the director of Microsoft's research department and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee praised the U.S. government's previous technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, the Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state grants.
"It's not China that's taking away academic leaders, it's corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the brightest minds from universities to work on AI research over the past few years.
Lee said that immigration policy changes could also help the United States boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhD students in artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards", he said.
The Chinese State Council published the next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
"The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to academics in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China", Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to engage partners from the business and academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of an Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been taking no action for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
The citizens of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Saturday whether they want to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that could resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked Greece from opening negotiations to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents ownership of its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Giorgi Ivanov has stated that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the vote has cast doubt on whether the exit will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership while accepting a deal with Greece?"
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission should be able to provide a clear and transparent assessment of the situation in the Member States.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us", said Olivera Georgijeva (79) in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, it is enough for members of parliament to say that they will respect it to be considered decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% during the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Gose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško, took part in a referendum on the country's name change in Strumica on 30 September 2018, which would pave the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage in front of the Parliament in Skopje and received chairs in front of the tent set up by those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not as servants", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us under the name Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate is above 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said a positive outcome would be the confirmation of our future.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will access the referendum, which is below the required response.
A second poll by Macedonian Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since taking office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire defence of Brighton to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defence at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday and won the match 2-0.
Aguero made the win madly simple, hitting the ground in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received an addition in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
He broke through three of Brighton's defensive players and then got on the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opponents in green shirts.
He bypassed one of the defenders, then overtook several others on the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball left to Sterling.
The English striker from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguero who threw the right-handed pitcher into the right side of the net and defeated Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
Aguero has some foot problems, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has told reporters.
We planned to play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he got a hit at that point.
But Sterling was the one who gave the Sky Blues a starting lead in the Premier League.
That shot was taken in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep on Brighton's court during that game.
He added a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane along his left thigh.
Sanne pushed the ball a couple of times before directing Sterling to the static.
Sky Blues striker threw the ball into the net before slipping into the car.
Manchester City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to block the Rockies' progress.
Since the National players were eliminated from the playoffs, there was not much reason to insist on a fresh start.
But always competitive, Scherzer hopes for a Sunday win against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League West, make it to the playoffs.
The Rockies have secured a wild-card spot on Friday night with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but they're still hoping to win their first title.
Even if we play for nothing, we can at least throw out knowing what the atmosphere is like here in Denver with a crowd of fans, and the other team would be playing at the highest level I'd witness this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?
The Nationals have yet to announce Sunday's starter, but they're reportedly willing to offer Scherzer a game in that case.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, was warming up in the pitching room Thursday and will play Sunday, when he usually rests.
The Washington right-hander has posted a 18:7 record this season, a 2.53 earned run average (ERA) and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During a speech on the importance of Republican voter turnout in the general election, the President bluntly commented on his election of Bret Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice.
Everything we've done is going to be tested in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are some of the big, big ones I didn't run for, but I'm actually in the race and that's why I'm everywhere, to fight for great candidates, he said.
Trump continues: "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it's happening right now.
Their intention is to take back power by any means; you see evil, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to trample on to take power and control, so they want power and control.
Democrats, he says, have a mission to resist and interfere.
"You've seen this over the last four days", he said, calling Democrats "bad, evil, corrupt and liars".
He named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which caused a loud public outcry.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you released the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document. It was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer respects differences of opinion.
He does not tolerate personal opinions
I wasn't too surprised when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the last of a line of Labour Party MPs who have been told they are not welcome... and all because we said what we had in mind.
According to me, my colleague in the House of Representatives, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the censorship proposal for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics that Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with his previous leadership on.
The notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that we wanted the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour Party representative, the general council meetings on Friday night were just like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings today take a different tone, and the promise of a more loving, gentle policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues I thought shared similar political views began to demand a drastic change of mind and a stance I would never have otherwise agreed with  whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I address the public  and it doesn't really matter what I say  there's a bunch of insulting words on social media calling for my resignation, denying the policies of the Centre and telling me I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I know I've been more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I've been made are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face an avalanche of sexist or racist comments every day, but never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that has disappointed me the most is the tolerance of offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn last week said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer respect differences of opinion and that with every motion of no confidence or change in election rules we become an increasingly grumpy party.
Many times in the last two years, they have advised me to shake my head, not to be so loud, and told me that everything would be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, fueled by the neglect of Margaret Thatcher's government which had allowed my multi-purpose schoolroom to decay, I wanted to provide better public services to those who needed them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East branch could be misled about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I can say to those who backed the proposal on Friday is that at a time when the country is grabbing on to Brexit that will negatively impact households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But the only message I have, in fact, is not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituencies, whether they're members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political advantage will deter me from acting as I believe is in your best interest.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr  Melrose: 38: 17 undefeated Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have had some effect on the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
Now they've reached the top of the ladder and are the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the team's best defense and better use of the opportunity led to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be content.
"They've tried us every game so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from the Melrose Club said, "To Ayra's credit, they took advantage of the opportunity better than us.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt by Frazier Climo led Ayr to the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was ruled out by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by 11 points before, at halftime, he scored a goal and made a solo attempt to change the score to 17:5 before the break.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, who made Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
Then a long break occurred due to the serious injury of Ruarid Knott who was carried on the carrier, and as the game continued, Ayr continued the good game with the attempt of Stafford McDowall who realised the Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson was then given the yellow card and Melrose again forced an extra player to pay, and this by an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The sideman, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to demolish the club that did not have the ball; from the line for the penalty kick, MacPherson made a lay-out behind Ayra in a full-scale breakthrough.
Climo realized, as he had done almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe received a high kick from David Armstrong and sent sideman Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt at home.
The star of the Still Game series seems poised for a new career in the restaurant business
Ford Kiernan, the star of the series Still Game, appears poised to resume service after it was revealed that he was appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's favourite series of which he is a writer and one of the stars, alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last to air, and it appears Kiernan is planning to dedicate himself to life after Craig Lang.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source for the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
Bolivia, which has no way out to sea, hopes that the court will grant it a way out to the Pacific Ocean
The Marines are patrolling a naval center full of elevators in La Paz.
The flag of the ocean color is reported on public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon or wings: "We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to return it.
Across Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the lost coastline to Chile during the 19th-century resource conflict is still alive  just as the longing for re-entry to the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia awaits an International Court of Justice ruling on October 1, after a five-year process, hopes may be at their highest level in decades.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, looks forward to the outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the International Court of Justice's ruling on the big screens and hope that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia's view that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to the Bolivian sea.
Here's Morales, a charismatic Bolivian native president facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from the ruling on Monday.
We're back in the Pacific Ocean, he promised by the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that little would have changed if it had.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The International Court of Justice's ruling comes just six months after the final hearings, meaning the case was more complex, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, they may have been compromised for the past four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has now taken over Bolivia's leadership", Zarate said.
Morales' warlike rhetoric buried Chile's good will, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will resume dialogue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
Those two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales  was still one of the most beloved presidents in Latin America  used the maritime issue as a political stunt.
Bolivia will never relinquish its right of access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
"Judgment is an opportunity to see that we must transcend the past".
North Korea has said it will not achieve nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his people will never be nuclear-armed if they can't trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises during the meeting of the leaders of these two rival countries in Singapore.
He made the comments at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the sanctions have continued because of "false imaginations" and that opposing the US declaration of the end of the Korean War will not bring the North to its knees.
Washington is unwilling to support the declaration without Pyongyang first taking concrete steps to disarm.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's serious intention to give up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion magazines reveal that the last line of major head covers on the way to the luxury store in your neighborhood
Whether you want to upgrade your hat collection or completely shield yourself from the sun, look no further.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the fashion tracks presented a line of bulky headgear for their spring and summer 2019 collection and delighted fashion enthusiasts at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have been blended into Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their own creations that draw attention to the track.
Valentino came up with a striking example: a large beige hat with a wide feathered skirt that completely took over the model's head.
Other glamorous additions included a decorated skull, a witch hat, and even pineapples, but these additions were not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also introduced a collection of bizarre masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the yellow masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion pieces.
One design resembled a diving suit with a sleeve and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
If you follow the big fashion saying, luck is on your side.
Stylists predict that huge hats could be found in luxury stores in your neighborhood.
The huge hats fit perfectly with the signature La Bomba, a straw hat with a rim about 60 cm wide that has been seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hat that broke social media on the fashion track sent another big creation  a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in the swimsuit she was wearing.
A deeply orange raffle bag, decorated with raffle carvings and a white leather lunch, was an exhibited item in Jacquemus' 2019 summer collection La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous and celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big beach hats and bags in luxury stores next summer.
John Edward: Language skills that citizens of the world need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another outstanding test score package, with additional weight given to individual and joint successes in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the careers they want and make them citizens of the world.
As the education sector that can design and implement the curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it goes to his heart.
This statement is a powerful reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's final exams show that the highest grades in languages were achieved by students from independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages got excellent grades.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of pupils received excellent grades for Mandarin, while 72% of pupils who learn German, 69% of pupils who learn French and 63% of pupils who learn Spanish also received the highest possible grades.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Today, languages are considered as electives as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
The UK's Employment and Skills Commission survey conducted in 2014 found that 17% of employers could not fill jobs due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for careers.
As more and more jobs demand language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career they choose, people who have learned to speak a foreign language will experience the benefits of such long-term skills in the future.
A person who speaks several languages can communicate directly with strangers, giving him an advantage over the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov, which in 2013 involved more than 4000 adults, 75% of respondents in the United Kingdom do not know a foreign language well enough to communicate in it, and French is the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, or 15%.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today's children.
If children learn more languages, especially those of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, every school offers different languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their curriculum, while others will choose languages considered to be most important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, independent schools will always have a variety of choices, as well as teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland provide an environment in which children can learn and prepare for and equip with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be ignored that in today's global business climate, language skills are very important for the future of every country and must be reflected in education.
So knowing modern languages really should be seen as an international communication skill.
Independent schools will continue to offer language choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
I need to do it well.
John Edward is the Director of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron's first game in Lakers uniform on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans will soon be expecting LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not clear how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes", Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is unlikely to play the entire game.
After training earlier this week, James answered questions about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
"I really don't need preseason games at this stage of my career", he said.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching his campaign with a series of meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned meetings Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet cast his vote for a new Supreme Court justice and plans to increase support for the upcoming election because there is a risk that Republicans will lose their majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time does tonight's Trump rally start in West Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 PM Eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's performance in West Virginia online through live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's nominee, which have sparked controversy over allegations of sexual assault.
But the primary goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans gain the upper hand in November's election.
So Trump's campaign headquarters is reporting that the five meetings scheduled for next week are aimed at "stimulating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and increase their majority in the Senate and House", Reuters reports.
"The majority in Congress is so important to the president's plans that he will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter the hectic campaign", an anonymous Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight's rally at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will be visiting West Virginia for the second time in a month on Saturday, where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey of West Virginia, who is running out of polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president needs to help him improve his polling rankings", said political scientist Simon Haedar of West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA left heart on the field before individual kickoffs on Sunday
After three one-way sessions, a couple's breakdown on a Sunday afternoon may be just what was supposed to turn the Ryder Cup around.
'The wheel of fortune turns' is a saying that is especially true in sports and that athletes believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Whose wheel of fortune is now favored?
They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So I think luck is on our side right now", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans have a four-point lead with 12 points remaining in the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their backs and encouragement from his paired game with Justin Thomas, with whom he won three of four points after a full day's play.
Spieth has played killer from tee to green and can serve as an example to others.
The fan-favorite cheers got louder as Spieth and Thomas came two points behind, culminating in a key route that led to Spieth's unresolved result.
After his 15-hole win, a similar cheerleading followed, in which hope and faith can be recognized that Americans can turn things around.
"You just have to concentrate and think about your game", Spieth said.
That's all that's left for these players now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup sensation.
A strange but irresistible European couple has the maximum number of points and can't make a mistake.
Mollywood is the only couple that didn't lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but he also skipped a bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and a back nine on Friday morning.
This winning streak, and the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and the Mill, shows that they are the very players to win on Sunday.
Maybe they both win at the same time on different holes.
But it's still too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly got Alex Noren and Sergio Garcia who had a great performance in this morning's couples game.
One bogey and two double bogey on the first nine holes in the playground buried a Spaniard and a Swede in a hole they couldn't dig.
However, there will be no one on Sunday to help individuals dig their own hole.
It's fascinating to watch the games of pairs up close because you can see the interactions of the players in pairs, hear the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and study a strategy that can change in an instant.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far, and they're coming in on the last day with a significant lead, but this match in pairs has also shown that the U.S. team has the necessary fighting, which some, especially Stateside, have doubted.
Europeans enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a lead of 10:6
Europeans after Saturday's pair games on the final day of the Ryder Cup enter with a significant 10:6 lead over the United States.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods led by four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team in their bid to win the trophy that eluded them at Hazeltine two years ago was superior to the American team in the morning pairs match by a score of 3:1
The American team showed more fighting in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already large.
To win the trophy, the Jim Fury team must score eight points in 12 individual games on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European team debutant to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as Molliwood, are after a sensational weekend only the second pair to score four points in a pair game in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball, they proved dominant in a game against Woods and American rookie Bryson DeCambeau with a 5&4 win.
Woods, who didn't do his best performance in two Saturday games, made some brilliant moves, but now he's 19 losses out of 29 games in fourballs and doubles and seven straight losses.
Justin Rose paused his morning fourballs to return to the pairings with partner Henrik Stenson and suffer a 2&1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best players in the world.
But Europeans did not fare as well on a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday, setting the record high for their American team.
They first defeated Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Poulter by 2&1 in fourballs, and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team that was four points behind managed to return in individual games, although Furyk's team only needed an unresolved score to keep the trophy.
After two days behind, it seems their Sunday counterattack will be hard to come by.
North Korea has declared that there is no chance of unilateral disarmament without confidence.
The North Korean foreign minister said Saturday before the United Nations that further sanctions increase distrust of the United States and that there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that last year North Korea took "significant goodwill measures", such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test station, and making a decision to halt development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States", he added.
"If we don't trust the United States, we don't trust our national security, and under these circumstances, there's no way we're going to be the first to unilaterally disarm".
While Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's opposition to a "gradual" denuclearization approach that would gradually lift sanctions on North Korea, his statement is significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever meeting between the current US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula while Trump promised North Korea security.
North Korea wants to officially end the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States has made Pyongyang's nuclear weapons waiver conditional.
Washington has also ignored calls for a reduction in stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists that denuclearization be done before then and is increasing pressure through sanctions to force its goal, and even opposes the declaration of an end to the war, Ri added.
The perception that sanctions can get us down on our knees is just a delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that continuing sanctions increases distrust.
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for the second Kim-Trump meeting the US president spoke about earlier this week at the United Nations.
But the minister pointed out that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in had held three meetings in the last five months and added: "If denuclearization had been sought by South Korea, not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a halt".
Regardless, the tone of Minister Ri's speech was vastly different from last year's speech to the UN General Assembly, when he declared that targeting the continental United States with missiles was inevitable after the evil President Trump called Kim "a human missile" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened the "total destruction" of North Korea, this year praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in disarmament, but added that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea executes its denuclearization.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no time frame for denuclearization and added: "It doesn't matter if it lasts two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its measures.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be strictly continued until complete, final and verified denuclearization is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to halt funding for the nuclear and ballistic missile program in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Riy at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea recalled him after hours due to gangster demands.
North Korea has agreed to meet Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex that will be achieved if the United States takes appropriate action.
He added that Kim had revealed to him that the relevant measures relate to the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps to stabilize relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard are taking a class that teaches them how to rest well
A new course at Harvard University has allowed all students to get a good night's sleep in an attempt to combat the increasingly widespread culture of caffeine-induced learning and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students at the world's best universities often have no idea about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed what he believes is the first course of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea for the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And at the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, "Why did I just find out about this, in my senior year of college?"
She said no one had told her how important sleep was, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
This year's first class explains how good sleeping habits help students succeed academically and athletically and improve overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's Health Service, says the university decided to introduce the course after students were diagnosed with severe lack of sleep during the week.
The unit course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks involves a picture of a student bedroom where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, tennis shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects success, and how important a sleep routine is.
During the course, students also learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then a map of the campus is displayed with interactive icons that encourage students to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that students' behavior won't change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect health", added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride in full-time pre-exam learning still exists, the professor says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
The professor says that a student's secret weapon against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety should be good, quality sleep, which also helps in the fight against obesity, because lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it in a state of hunger, and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending his first-year Harvard class.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, it plans to ask all graduates to complete a similar subject before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students turn on an alarm when sleeping and when waking up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt circadian rhythms and cause sleep problems.
Livingston  Rangers 1: 0: Mengin's goal defeated Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Menge's strike outscored Steven Gerrard's lack of defense and ended the game with a 1-0 win over Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to take their first ever host win after a February triumph and a 4:1 draw at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side caused Gerrard's second 18-game defeat, so his side now lacked eight points in the Ladbrokes Premiership for the leading Hearts.
Meng got the lead seven minutes into the half, and the Rangers seemed to be out of inspiration and didn't seem to even the score.
While the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third with just one small difference behind Hibernian.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence sustained a head injury when an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight hip changes and thus competed alongside Ayra to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was following the same approach as Livingston had taken to Hearts last week and would have been thrilled that his well-designed approach had stifled every attempt by his opponent.
The Rangers may have had more balls in their possession, but Livingston got more with it.
They had a chance to score two minutes after Meng was first thrown out of the game, which opened up the door for Scott Pittman to head for Allan McGregor's goal, however, the captive missed that opportunity.
Keagan Jacobs' deep free kick was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass an imprecise kick into the rear.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game, it seemed like they were playing with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that the judge should have sentenced him to 11 minutes in 15 minutes after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson disregarded Columbia's request.
The Rangers managed to put just two balls in the first half, but for former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly, a blow to the head by Lassane Coulibaly and the stupid blow by Ovie Eary were not a big deal.
Although Livingston's 34 minutes of play slowed down the game, no one can deny their efforts.
The Rangers have again failed to use Jacobs' deep-ball return.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson who kept the ball in his pocket and chose Mengo for an easy finish.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, a replacement that almost had an immediate effect because the wingman added the ball to Morelos, but impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into the game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett performed one long stroke after another.
Holt's side could have extended the lead in the final seconds, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide angle takeoff.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton once again asked for an 11 late because he got into a fight with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his back on the look this time.
Almanah: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Almanac in the Sunday Morning show is: September 30, 1882, 136 years and a few days ago... the birthday of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from that invention came a device later known as the Geiger counter.
A major center of science since that time, the Geiger counter has also become a major center of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Colorado, starring the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that, for God's sake?"
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms reacting to radioactivity in minerals.
You see that, it's very audible!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect bad cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and destroy bad cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment.
The procedure involves removing immune system cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
The cells are treated to recognize the protein common to many cancers and then injected back into the patient.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various cancers.
In one vaccine-treated woman whose immune system is learning to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has been withdrawn for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves removing immune system cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory to identify a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and re-injecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 promotes the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from a patient and learning how to recognize cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after appearing on Saturday Night Live, joined the debate over Trump and backed him up, wearing a hat that read, "Let's Make America Great Again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was scouted in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a show with interruptions in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for President in 2020.
After performing the third song of the evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great Again", he continued to speak out against Democrats and repeatedly supported Trump.
I talk to white people so often and they tell me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Bret Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it was not broadcast, a video of West's social media speech was shared by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to manipulate West with the announcement.
Also, West complained to the audience that he was being pushed back for the hood he was wearing.
They pissed me off behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go anywhere with that drop".
They've been mistreating me!
They said I drowned, reports the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the bottom?" and said he'd put on his Superman coat because it means I can't tell him what to do.
Try it with love.
Variety magazine wrote that his comments had caused at least two times the public's displeasure, and Saturday Night Live members were humiliated, while one person told the magazine: "The whole studio has been silenced".
West was called at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West's performance of the song "I Love It", dressed like a bottle of Perrier mineral water, amazed many.
Westa was backed by Candace Turner, head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous people:
But host Karen Hunter on Twitter announced that West was simply his own and that it was absolutely wonderful.
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothes or supporting his art) for whom I believe he accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we are, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be officially known as Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who's also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder with a knife at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with the attempted murder of a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police have reported the incident at Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear at Belfast Criminal Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
The star of the Game of Thrones series, Kit Harington, has struggled with toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow, the sword-swarmer in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has criticized the stereotypical macho hero, saying that such television roles often make boys feel they have to be tough to earn respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed something went wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie from Game of Thrones, admitted that he wants to face this problem very decisively.
"I personally feel very decisive at this moment where we have mistaken manhood?" he asked himself.
What have we taught men as they grow up, relative to the problem we now see?
Kit believes that television, thanks to the very masculine characters on the screens, could be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity.
He went on: "What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes boys feel they have to have these certain lines of man?
I think that's actually one of the big questions of our time. How can we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for the boys.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not be filming the sequel to Game of Thrones after its conclusion next summer and said he was done with the battles and horses.
From November, Kit will star in a new production of Sam Shepard's True West, about a film producer and his brother robbing.
The actor recently revealed that he feels meeting Rose's wife was the best thing that ever happened to him during the filming of Game of Thrones.
"I met my husband on the set of that show, which gave me a family and a future life", he revealed.
Rose starred in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series as Ygritte, the love of Keith's character, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 percent increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
The Commission also concluded that the Commission's decision to initiate the procedure for the determination of the amount of aid to be granted to the beneficiary of the aid was not in line with the objective of the scheme.
The vast majority of new infections are sexually transmitted, a change from the past.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly throughout parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health authorities said that people infected with HIV in this way are almost gone.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is high.
Studies estimate that because of conservative values in the country, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of disease in such relationships occur because of inadequate protection during sex.
As part of the effort to address this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV drugs in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has leaked information about the GOP to the Senate, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Walters on Saturday dismissed claims that a member of her staff posted personal information on three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia pages.
A Democratic congresswoman in Los Angeles assures that these claims are being spread by ultra-right-wing individuals, as well as websites.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies", Waters tweeted.
The disclosed data allegedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information went online on Thursday, and was released by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing over allegations of sexual assault by Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address revealing the source of the publication of this data belongs to the office of Representative Waters, as well as information about the representative's staff member, The Hill reported.
"These unfounded allegations are completely false and absolutely false", Waters continued.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false and untrue statements is in no way responsible for the leakage of these data.
These unfounded claims are completely false and absolutely false.
Ms. Waters' statement quickly attracted online critics, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is a furious denial", wrote Fleischer.
That shows Waters doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's been accused of something he didn't do shouldn't be angry.
He can't be boring.
He can't question the prosecution's motives.
He must be calm and considerate.
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Barbara Walters' reaction to the criticism the Democrats are making of Judge Kavanaugh, who they accused of acting too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running against Waters in the general election, also announced on Twitter.
"It matters if it's true", he wrote.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the law enforcement and regulatory authorities of these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed and that they bear legal consequences for any acts that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet", she continued.
Johnny English: Back on the mission. Not interesting enough. Rowan Atkinson is fighting a spy.
It is now commonplace in every new British film to seek messages about Brexit, and it seems to be the case in the new screening of the action series Johnny English, whose first sequel, Johnny English, was first shown in 2003 and returned to the big screen in 2011.
Will our own winding satire about how obviously worthless we are become a new national export opportunity?
The incompetent Johnny English with his eyes and rubber face is again allowed to complicate the situation, while his name more than anything says that it is a comedy creation for a wide audience designed for countries where the cinema is not in English.
He's a naturally disbanded secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to the offended glamour, reminds him of Inspector Clouseau, has a Mr. Bean personality tag, and somewhat reminds him of the guy who sang one note of the opening song of the Charity of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
His character is also inspired by the traveler and mysterious world man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and who is a personification of chaos.
There's one or two good moments in this latest edition of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is apparent, but humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually overwhelming, especially now that serious movie titles like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer elements of comedy themselves.
Humor seems to be aimed at children, not adults, and in my opinion, Johnnie English's disfigured episodes are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's silent gags embodied in Mr. Bean.
The assumption that Great Britain is in serious trouble is now a widely accepted fact.
The hacker has infiltrated Britain's most secretive spy network and uncovered the identities of all British agents, to the horror of a duty agent unfortunately briefly played by Kevin Eldon.
It's a glass of the Prime Minister's patience, of the supreme and warlike character who is experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he's politically hated: Emma Thompson is trying to portray faithfully the character who should represent Theresa May, but she hasn't really gotten the material to do anything with.
Intelligence counsel reveals to her that all active spies are compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate the retired agent.
And this person will be the careless head and beard of Johnny English who is currently employed as the principal of a fine school, but secretly teaching how to become a secret agent: here are some hot guys because English teaches rocker-style espionage.
English is quickly taken to the government room for an emergency meeting, where he meets again with Bough, his former partner and his eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the overly enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely lost.
And so two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who are doing everything completely wrong are back in action and meet the beautiful, fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, who was incarnated by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems, the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their exciting journey with absurd and funny plots: disguised as waiters, a flaming French restaurant, they cause a huge mess by sneaking into Volta's luxury yacht, and English provokes complete anarchy by trying to use virtual reality headphones to find out what the interior of Volta's house looks like.
Everything was done right for this last sequel, but as attractive and distracting as the film was, it still contains a lot of childish elements.
It's a pretty mediocre accomplishment.
And as was the case with other Johnny English films, I wondered again, can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkins a role that matches his talent?
The Labour Party has denied it's developing a plan to make Britons work four days a week and be paid five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan to make it possible for Britons to work four days a week and be paid five days.
The party allegedly wants the company's bosses to pass on the savings achieved by the AI revolution to the workers and give them an extra day off.
That would mean employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could be incorporated into the party's economic agenda and plans to favor the interests of the workers.
The trade union congress supported the shift to a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour party source told the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
The four-day workweek will not be achieved overnight but represents an aspiration to align with the party's approach to economic balance for the benefit of workers and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept this trend.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not the party's policy and the party does not consider it.
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last year's Labour Party conference to develop his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to take power from the hands of the dirty managers and the profiteers in the utilities.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to recover their full stake because the Labour government could make a complaint based on the perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to include workers in the company's board of directors and to create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of the private company's capital to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking to 60 Minutes about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Bret Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency's conclusion could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that aired on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was any possibility the FBI would reveal anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
I mean, of course, Kennedy said.
I said I was going to the hearing, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after you reported this, and I asked him, 'Did you do this?'
He was determined, unshakable, unambiguous.
Graham's voice, however, is like it's carved into a rock.
"I'm determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and I really need a strong indictment to change that", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has decidedly denied everything, Graham added, thinking of Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the people she named could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changed.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it achieved anything in poverty reduction?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an incredibly impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to Central Park to not only enjoy performances by stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the event's real goal, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks or activities such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, phone calls, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen really given that it has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of clicktivism where people feel that signing an online petition or tweeting really makes a difference?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million actions by its supporters who have sought to achieve a range of different goals.
He claims that these actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will result in a total of more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established a specific methodology for the assessment of the impact of the measures on the environment.
The Group estimates that the funds insured have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide to date.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor and carrier partnership committed to helping children reach their full potential, with a pledge to provide $35 million in support to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the region following more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a mere fluke in history", Tracey Ullman, ambassador for the Power of Nutrition Foundation, told a London concert audience in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government has announced funding for the project The Power of Nutrition which will provide nutritional interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, which reads: "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replies: "It's going to be a long and difficult road, and we're going to fail someday.
But we will succeed, as did the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.
Performances by Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawna Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the performances at this year's New York event to be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy as a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports.
Washington can, if necessary, use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinké said that Russian involvement in Syria ̶ especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government ̶ is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in the region as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe", he says.
But he believes that there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of sea lanes and blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinka addressed the attendees at an event hosted by the nonprofit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which in the United States is represented as the voice of energy consumers.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less fuel-use and replacement", he said, and for Russia he says the same trick is being used in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
The statements came at the same time as the Trump administration's intention to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the unsuitable Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin the "sacrifice" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of dishonest competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of putting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance provoked a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to withdraw from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says a Massachusetts state senator.
Massachusetts State Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a live public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running herself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that involves a woman at the helm", she said, The Hill reports.
After November 6, I'm seriously considering running for president.
Warren expressed her opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with the citizens, saying she was leading their country in the wrong direction.
I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, she said.
Warren has been an outspoken critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Bret Kavanaugh.
In a tweet she posted on Friday, Warren says, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that most Warren voters don't think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Political Research, 58 percent of likely voters in Massachusetts said a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent of the vote in favor of a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic names discussed in connection with the potential 2020 presidential race include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin is referring to PTSD tracker Palin at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident that occurred on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, is comparable to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers are coming back with", she told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem she kept quiet about for her son and other war veterans, she said they're coming back a little different, coming back stubborn, coming back wondering if there's respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the military, have given for this country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, tampering with a domestic violence report, and possession of a weapon in an alcoholic state, says Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla City Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a review of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of deniing asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and counties filed a friendly report Friday in Washington to provide support for an asylum seeker who is challenging policy, NBC News reports.
Many of the names of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy have not been released.
She said her partner and violent gang members abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which are home to a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence.
A new U.S. asylum policy amended the Immigration Committee's 2014 decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy ignores decades of state, federal, and international law.
Federal law requires that all asylum claims be dealt with on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such an obstacle violates that principle, the report of the court's friends states.
Lawyers further argued that policies that deny immigrants entry are detrimental to the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and secure the necessary workforce.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in a policy statement on June 11.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems ̶ even all the serious problems ̶ that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palua as the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
The situation for the survivors was getting worse.
"The situation is very tense", said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, while comforting her boy who was shaking in fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Paluu.
She drove the ambulance every minute they brought in the bodies.
The government is running out of clean water.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, scrolling through flooded things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were crumbling.
Some of the injured, including Dwight Harris, who suffered a broken back and shoulders, were resting outside the Palua Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to continuing strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he spoke of the powerful earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was trapped inside the ruins of the wall, Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of "abusing" through propaganda ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page long ad in an American daily newspaper promoting mutual trade benefits between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of abusing the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid addition of the Iowa newspaper, the Des Moines Register, to the China Daily newspaper after he accused China of trying to meddle in the US congressional elections on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the US election marked what US officials in a statement to Reuters characterized as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place commercial ads, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the start of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, China's top agricultural exporter, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China is now doubling the amount of abuse by running propaganda ads in our own free press.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, on the street newspaper kiosk in Beijing you will find limited opposition voices and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions the Chinese people may have about the troubling Chinese economic path because the media are under strong pressure from the Communist Party of China", he wrote.
He added that some of China's most prominent newspapers had declined an offer to publish his article, although he did not say which ones.
Kavanaugh's debilitating Republicans have pushed voters away from midterm elections, analysts warn.
As many Republicans stand with Supreme Court Justice Bret Kavanaugh and defend him over several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming midterm elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were very upset, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their voice.
Such things cannot be returned, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, told a paper published Saturday.
Reeher expressed suspicion that Senator Jeff Flack's last insistence on the FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive movement MovOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted, "Come cold!" in the Senate lobby as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee prepared to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all expectations", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news.
People say they're already at a high level, which is true.
But they could be higher, especially among suburban women and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, while not liking the president, often don't run.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her sexual assault claims by the Supreme Court justice nominee, analysts suggest that a backlash could arise if Republicans continue to confirm.
"This is a real mess for the old Big Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, NBC News reports.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the bench, but the way the Republicans approached it and treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news.
However, it seems that Americans are somewhat divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh testify, with a slight inclination to him.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford's testimony to be true, while 35 percent said they definitely or likely believe Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same for Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that her Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals at a party during her Yale studies in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that's developing on the basis of Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid enables users to choose the location of their data storage and the people to whom access to certain information will be granted.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was world domination.
'We have to do it now,' he said thinking of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data storage, or POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of commitments, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on the same browser at the same time.
What's unique about personal online storage is that the decision about who can access what information is entirely up to the users.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to provide the resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, several engineers who signed contracts to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, development engineers from around the world were able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they want to introduce a complete change in which all their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
We're not asking their permission.
In a statement on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even as Inrupt runs, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A celebration of the awarding of the Victorian Cross to a First World War priest
A celebration in honour of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a World War I combatant was hanged in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had received Britain's highest military honor.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was incredibly symbolic that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's invention for which he received this recognition.
According to the official London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St. Quentin Canal through a very thick fog and under heavy fire coming from the battlefield and machine guns.
He later ran into the front lines and with incredible bravery led the unit forward before, without any help, he rushed to the Polish cannon and killed three of the army.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's works were something I know I could never achieve, and that encourages humility.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid the wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the bravery of a true hero is shown by the support of many people".
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, and instead they got Chicken Pepp.
Imagine this ̶ you stay up all night watching the Bellator 206 series of matches so you end up being unable to track the main event.
The San Jose program featured 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK it was shown live at night on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their match, viewers in the UK were shocked when the broadcast was interrupted by Peppa Pie.
Many were not impressed at all after the struggle alone kept them awake until the early hours of the morning.
One fan of the disruption of children's cartoons on Twitter described it as some kind of sick joke.
"Under state regulations, that content is not suitable for broadcast at 6 a.m., so they had to move it to a children's program", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
♪ Juppy, 'Praggy Peppa' ♪
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, has said he will align his schedules to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I consider the replay, I think we can probably fix something", Coker said.
But the transfer is there at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, and we won't be able to do anything until Sunday when they're already Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was cut, there were many messages circling around that weren't even friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it's a state-level problem.
I can promise you, it won't happen next time.
We're gonna keep five fights instead of six, which we're usually doing.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior in his sexuality.
Olympic water polo player Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority because of his sexuality ̶ but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said that until he went to high school, he was not aware that everyone was like me.
In his statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others a chance.
He also said that winning the Olympics has been less important to him since he became a father.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a villain on the first Laverne show, Daley said that growing up he felt less valuable than the others because it was more socially acceptable to love both boys and girls.
He said, "Until now, these feelings of inferiority and difference from others have been the real things that have given me the power and the strength to succeed".
He says he wanted to prove he was someone or something, so he wouldn't let anyone down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT advocate and used her performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to multiple countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt he was happy to live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem for him.
When you're so young you go through so much. He went back to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later. He said it was hard to find someone his age without having experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, they became the parents of a son, who they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his whole outlook had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all the stories would have been about me winning a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they got tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't tell him, "Dad, you're not gonna be here long enough to be in the front row", he said.
I held his hand as he came out, and it was only when he stopped breathing and died that I finally realized he wasn't invincible, he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've dreamed of my whole life, jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", he said.
It was also the inspiration for choosing the first song ̶ Proud by singer Heather Small ̶ that resonated in it during the preparation for the Olympics and which she always relies on.

Mickelson out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to get back in shape completely to avoid an inconvenient turnaround.
Mickelson, who is playing a record twelfth time in this two-year competition, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he often was for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and developing his game on the gym in the hope of correcting what was plaguing him.
Never the most accurate player, even at the peak of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding Le Golf National, where a long, uneven course routinely punishes inaccurate blows.
And if the pitch isn't scary enough, Mickelson is in Game 9 on Sunday facing the eventual British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has won all four games this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 games four points short, get to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had more faith in his man than he could say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me on the back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
She's got a lot of self-confidence.
He's famous and he's contributed a lot to teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I never imagined he'd play two games.
I thought there would be more, but that's how it worked out, and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be on the field, like everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Fold's record for Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career which never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-time losses, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for the team", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup individual matches can easily turn into an uncomfortable race.
Denmark made his debut in a match at Valderrama in 1997, where captain Seve Ballesteros' team had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the game ended in their victory with a narrow margin of 141⁄2 ̶ 131⁄2.
"You're always reminded that we had a big advantage at Walderra; we had a big advantage at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Walderra, where we won, but with a narrow margin", Bjorn said, in the photo, after watching the 2018 team that won 5'3 on Friday and led 10'6 on Le Golf National yesterday.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll play full force.
Get out there and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floors are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win this trophy, and that's what the focus is.
I keep talking, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're very aware of who's standing against us, the biggest players in the world.
Enthusiastic about his players' performances on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never run in front of a round like this.
Tomorrow, he's going to have to face a different beast.
Tomorrow's the main individual shows, and that's something completely different.
It's great to play with a partner when everything's going well, but when you're there as an individual, your golfing skills are on the final test.
That's the message you have to get across to the players, and it's that tomorrow they have to do their best.
Now leave your partner because he has to do his best.
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they did with their teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those big twists on the last day, as he was part of the winning team at Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe performed a miracle at Medina.
"I remember every damn word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
Tomorrow we have 12 big games, but you should try to get a great start like what you saw in Brooklyn, like what you saw in Medina.
When that lead goes in a certain direction, he puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
And accordingly we organized our stance and put the boys in as if we were, you know, going to try and perform magic tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the top half.
I decided this group of guys is going in this order because I think it's all-encompassing, Bjorn said of the players selected for individual matches.
German new warship put back on hold
The latest frigate of the German Navy was scheduled to enter service in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warships, but will not be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The launch of the vessel Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, Die Zeit reports, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but concerns about the aftermath of the delivery have hit the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, ordered by the Navy back in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, it will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
The Commission considers that the Commission should take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet established a specific type of vessel.
However, the constant delays mean that the most advanced warships ̶ which are said to allow Germany to show power abroad ̶ by the time they enter service will be obsolete, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to let the ship go into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key software and hardware flaws that would render the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software shortcomings were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be manned by a crew of about 120 sailors - half as many as the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also proved that the ship was dramatically overweight, reducing its efficiency and limiting the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz was twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project ̶ including crew training ̶ also becomes a problem.
The price is said to have reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) ̶ from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy actually has ships capable of deployment.
The official said that the problem had grown over time because old ships were out of commission and there were no replacement ships.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening in on the secret life of bats
New research on a Scottish Highlands estate aims to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The results are expected to clarify the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) will follow the common and swampy dwarf bats, as well as brown long-shouldered and river bats in the Inverview Gardens at Wester Ross.
Special cameras will be deployed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile inspections using handheld detectors.
A sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the bat's voting frequency and what species it is.
Then a map of the settlement and a report will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of working on management of habitats, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and renovation work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can mold and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by pet cats.
Batts aren't actually blind.
However, their nighttime hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated eholocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained specialists who regularly conduct research, inspect shelters, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten bat species found in Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal area for them.
"We have a huge bat area here in Threave", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good housing.
However, there is much we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and at other facilities will help us to better understand what they need to progress".
It stresses the importance of checking for bat presence before starting maintenance work inside buildings, since the accidental destruction of one litter could kill up to 400 females and young people, likely destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative for the Scottish Bat Protection Association, urged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are progressing".
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has characterized the rape allegations made against him as fake news, saying that people want to promote themselves using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published those charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorg in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In a live video he posted to his Instagram account for his 142 million followers hours after the indictment, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as false news.
No, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What they said today is fake news, says the five-time Golden Ball winner in the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal. I know.
They want to be famous enough to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine, added the football player with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they called "unacceptable reporting on privacy suspicions", reports Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek damages for a "moral damage" in the amount that matches the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the football room, where he allegedly raped her anal, documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada state.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was 99 percent the good guy that that one percent had let down.
Documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was a conciliator.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed in hospital, but later agreed to a settlement because she feared retaliation and feared being publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the deal because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of transferring to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he was transferred to Italian giant Juve for a €100 million transfer.
Brexit: UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK will forever regret losing its status as the world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, said Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, in the event that Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of the border wait in the case of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston ̶ power plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis ̶ produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My position is that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will experience production delays at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnston.
The Commission also examined whether the Commission had any doubts as to whether the Commission could have concluded that the measures were in line with the market conditions.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission should be able to assess the impact of the measures on the environment.
Toyota's production line operates on the principle of 'Right on time', where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a border disruption that the industry says could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota at its factory in Derbyshire could not hold more than what was needed for a day, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks.
"We need to make a deal. We want to reach the best possible deal that will allow, as I say, not only to sustain our current success, but also to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers shows that we absolutely need to be able to continue this very successful supply chain.
Toyota could not say how long production could be stopped, but warned that in the long run, the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working for Burnston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs go, they never come back.
A government spokesman says: "We have come up with a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House.
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week as the battle for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's election meddling, the ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and possible miscarriages of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby threaten Mueller's independence, has been stirring up Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied these statements.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid the announcement that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he'd like to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a tie-up with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a single FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date is not set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week considering everything else going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to inform the press about everything.
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Principal Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not a result of her dislike of the theatrical behavior of television reporters, although she said: "I will not object to the fact that they are being disseminated".
Then she hinted that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more questions-answer meetings than any president before him", she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've analyzed the numbers".
Short talks will continue, Sanders said, but if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the president of the United States a question, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to make this possible often, and you've seen it in the last few weeks, and just the fact that you can talk to the president of the United States will replace brief speeches to journalists.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with guest dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, by a free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of a gathering of journalists.
The Minister of Health is writing to EU workers working for the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland over fears of Brexit
The Minister for Health has sent a letter to EU staff at the Scottish NHS expressing their gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to mitigating the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal have continued, moving towards the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government is also intensifying preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
So I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contributions of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the playground line and just collapsed", Reed said.
Trainer and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting it on the carrier and sending it for further investigation.
A spokesman for Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had just been released from surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was no information on the type/scale of the injury and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with a two-year playing internship, is playing his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five pre-game shutouts, bringing his total to 18 shutouts in a season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher fees for buying property in the United Kingdom
Under the new Conservatives' plans, foreign buyers will be charged higher fees for buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless
That move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's effort to attract young voters
The increase in the fee will be imposed on non-payers of taxes in the United Kingdom.
The fund expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged higher fees for buying property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's effort to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing solutions and target high-paying ones.
The increase in fees will be charged to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will contribute to the Government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee ̶ which is added to the current fee, including an increase introduced two years ago on other homes and real estate purchased for the issuance of ̶ may be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects this move to raise £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by residents who do not reside in the UK, which raises prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy their first property to join the society of those who own their own home.
Many of the country's rich areas, especially the capital, have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tariff cut to help more young people get to their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by taking but not exploiting land, and urged Mrs May to waive the quota on affordable real estate to repair the disgrace of the housing situation in Britain.
Corbyn has announced proposals for a number of attractive housing reforms, including a rent control and an end to the unprovoked evictions.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my term to restoring the British dream that the lives of every new generation should be better.
And that means fixing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies based abroad, can buy homes as easily as valuable British people.
The dream of owning a home for a large number of people has become too far away, and the shame of homelessness is still so real.
My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland.
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his ultimate ambition is to one day become Scotland's manager.
Scott (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the North East club, which currently ranks third in the Premier League, three points short of the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-hat and that was it, Ross told BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always pulled me back.
But that opportunity could only be realized if I were successful in running the club.
Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul DiCania.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he wasn't afraid because he inherited such famous names at such a big club, after previously rejecting invitations to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at this point will be measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club is undoubtedly part of the Premier League, he said.
It's not easy to get there, but I probably would consider myself successful only if I could take the club back there.
Ross is just finishing his third year as manager, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months of experience as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloi recover from a third-place finish and led St. Mirren from the bottom of the standings to the next season's champion.
And Ross says he's now more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he recalled taking Alloe.
I really believed that management was what I was good at, more than playing.
Sounds unusual because I was doing well, earning solid money, and enjoying pretty good moments.
But the game can be tough.
There's a lot you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and work pressure, but management seems like the real thing.
I've always wanted to run, and now I do, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life.
You can listen to the entire interview on SportsSound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to get up is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, research shows.
The summer heat wave boosted the revenue of British pubs struggling with finances, but it increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
Data shows that pubs and bars saw revenue growth of 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenue fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from the Office of the Chief Business Inspector's Office, who collected the data, said: "The continued good weather and England's participation in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when pubs' revenues rose 2.8 percent, with restaurants now being hit even more hard.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant revenue in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that serve mostly drinks made much more profits on equal terms than the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is served mainly also suffered from the heat, though not as dramatically as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the run bars and pubs, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and sales of food fell by three percent".
Paul Newman, a researcher at RSM's Holiday and Hospitality Analyst, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors when it comes to sales in the foreign market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a fall in sales of 4,8 percent annually will be particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurant managers, and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much-needed relief.
The Commission also noted that the Union industry's market share was around EUR [...] million.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales tracking system for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and has established an industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Research reveals that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake Instagram sites
The news has increased fear of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students reported having a headline account that they showed their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, has a secret social media account that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Instagram accounts that refer to a photo-sharing website.
The news has increased the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students reported using a cleaned main account to show their parents, while also having private accounts.
One mother who came across a secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged her to use the words "rape me".
A survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Headmasters and Headmistresses (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's disturbing that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athlete at the Scottish Athletic Council.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Council as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those in the sport to draw on her extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and international athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from making her a member of the board", Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of the athlete and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, of his four Olympic golds, and is now a regular BBC expert, has been unable to walk since a passing ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it would only take time to see if I would recover and to what extent.
It was hard, but he recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today he's doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!
Shared opinions on the Internet about the advertisements for a traitor comparing mothers to cows
A traitor-producing company with its advertising that compares mothers breastfeeding their children to cows that are aroused by men has shared opinions on the Internet.
To mark the launch of what is claimed to be the world's first silent wearable traitor, consumer technology company Elvie has released an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom the new traitor gives mothers.
Four mothers dancing in a barn full of hay and cows with music that says, "Yes, I'm a husband to myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this isn't a vintage, it's my breasts".
Then the refrain follows: "Pump, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump, my lady's husband".
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it shines a light on the dairy industry.
It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen a few days after birth, one person wrote.
Elvie's traitor discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra.
Another person comments: "Reasonably traumatic for the mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors to mothers who will be able to keep their babies?
Someone added, "Totally irrelevant advertising".
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that the song was too funny for her.
I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I had another breast, I'd buy one.
Giving out milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I got it the way it is.
This is a brilliant product, she said.
Another person commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who are betraying their milk (often at their workplaces or in bathrooms) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with discreet traitors placed in their braces.
The campaign concept is based on the realization that many women who betray milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's traitor is completely silent, without wires or pipes, and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even come out during the betrayal.
Ana Balarin, partner and chief creative officer of Mother, commented: "Elvie's invention is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between the depiction of women and cows, we wanted to put betrayal and all its challenges at the center of attention, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time that Elvie's traitor has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on a fashion show for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children held in custody has increased even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it difficult to place children in sponsor care.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and feared risking their own ability to stay in the country by coming out and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and share the data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not previously recorded in criminal records.
Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsors' household in the country are illegal, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
So we're continuing to search for these individuals, Mr. Albence said.
According to the shelter's staff, in order to speed up the child's proceedings, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via videoconference, not in person, to present their case to the immigration court for legal status.
Those who do not meet the aid criteria will be deported quickly.
According to statements from shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent incidents or attempted escape.
Advocates said that these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as the Tornillo, where, due to its size, signs of child abuse are likely to be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare emotionally or to say hello to friends can cause the trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would be treated accordingly.
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he told the congregation.
Moualem insisted that the war on terrorism was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, while millions were left homeless.
He said Damascus will continue to fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared of terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed Western countries for spreading irrational fears that encouraged the refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a buffer zone at the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for further political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive Syrian-backed attack on the province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including Nusra fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked front, who would be eradicated.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the commission should be limited to a revision of the articles of the current constitution and warning against interference.
Why will Trump win a second term?
According to this logic, Mr. Trump should win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
In what would undoubtedly be the most dramatic presidential finale ever!
There's no sign of viewer fatigue at the moment.
Since 2014, the streaming time has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on a weekday, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed the average with as many as 3.5 million viewers on the evening of the mainstream news broadcast.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, producer of ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked.
He said, "Because he's making me laugh", and Mrs. Scovell apologized.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the abortion law that stemmed from Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
The exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
But yet, you're outnumbering an informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of deep background for his book Fear, about Paul Manafort's $15,000-worth of leather jacket and the implications of intimate descriptions, this, Mr. Trump's anatomy given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, Super Maria, will never look back with the same eyes.

When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his home on the north shore of Kauai Island, it was sunny at 80 degrees, but he was inside watching MSNBC and filming CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from television, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face to face with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the balance.
I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Money from outside goes down in the most uncertain midterm congressional race.
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to congressional districts being overrun, resulting in two candidates running for the same seat.
This recently renovated suburban district of Pittsburgh highlights Democrat Conor Lamb who won a seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th District, which overlaps greatly with the new 17th District.
The maps were redistributed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally redistricted in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th District has sparked a campaign finance battle between the main party fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Fundraising Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Convention Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning the widely-followed March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States is valid on whether to punish El Salvador for providing support to China, and then withdraws.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to call in the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
But the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar gathering last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus effectively ended any consideration of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the administration's emphasis on the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman on Mr. Bolton's behalf declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their report was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
The Story
Next in line could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which now has very substantial publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly arranged with Russia as part of its attack on our election.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to run again before the voters, and perhaps eventually with a jury of his peers.
There are many of these, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Truman's downfall is inevitable - or those of his kind in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, only to be opposed by the West and supported by the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to escape the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such inflection points, and the relentless march of democracy is either accelerating or slowing.
Americans are now facing several of these inflection points.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he secretly suggested filming the president and speculating about his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the recently ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite compelling sexual assault charges and dishonest testimony?"
And most of all, will we vote in the midterm elections for Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I believe we will not fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once dined at my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on that table with a cork cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic about facing Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers hosted the Rapids from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive rematch in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorrance's fielder from making his first appearance of the season until the 2⁄2-game rematch with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent", the 31-year-old said.
We entered the game believing we could accomplish something and we scored a point.
We may have been able to steal the game eventually, but, in general, the outcome is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can score three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, in the midst of all the things that happened to me with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there's a good feeling.
The team's good and the guys really enjoy it; training is good.
Let's hope we can move on now, leave the past season behind and be successful.
Women can't sleep because they're afraid of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the Nationwide respondents said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had discussed it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to start a conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caring unless you express your wishes beforehand.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include traditional long-term care insurance, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy that will help you cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own wealth ̶ as long as you have money.
Set your legal documents: At the root, prevent legal battles.
Employ health professionals to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your needs in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider empowering your finances.
You want to choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so.
Remember these small details: Imagine that your aging parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down the details in the written plan so that you can be prepared.
"It's not just about finances, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan in your hand.
A man shot multiple times from a rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times by a shotgun while returning home from a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST, as a "number-on" act.
Victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
As communications were cut off, aid officials could not get any information from Donggala Province, an area north of Palua that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palua, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggali, Sulawesi:
Palau is the capital of Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches over 300 km of coastline on the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The district, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The fishing and agriculture are the basis of the economy of Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of the building.
2018: A major earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sara Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su's custody and held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, on the question of pleading guilty, he pleaded guilty, of course, the network reported.
Palina is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palina.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, tampering with a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon in an alcoholic state related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Paluu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people. A rare death sentence that hasn't been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck at the Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side of Lower Manhattan, where he killed pedestrians and cyclists who found themselves on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip deliberately killed eight victims and intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those points lead to the possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury in Saipov struck a 22-point indictment that included eight counts of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and counts of assault and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack required careful planning and premeditation, prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out it as vile, cruel and corrupt.
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrell Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Damián Pagnucca, the intention notice said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a federal case in New York in 1953, when married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he was feeling good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching ISIS video on his phone he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment said.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing the Saipov, said they were "extremely disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a guilty plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says Nigel Farrage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to mobilize the People's Army during a protest at a conservative conference.
The former head of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to feel pressure from eurosceptics as one MP, Therese May, suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone has declared a protest in Birmingham that the UK would have so far come out if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks is highlighted by Tory left-wingers joining a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her compromise plan Chequers amid an attack by Brexit supporters, staying supporters and the EU.
Allies insisted that she would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and the Kaosa.
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave campaign rally in Solihull that he wanted to get rid of Chequers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be given the title and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must get rid of the Chequers".
He said: 'We have not fought world wars to be subservient.
We want to bring our own laws into our country.
Mr Bone rejected the claim that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain completely incorrect".
Conservative and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also in the concession, speaking to reporters saying, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who took to the streets and elected us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.
In a note, Mrs May added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage told the crowd that politicians must be forced to feel pressure if they are going to disappoint the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It's now a matter of trust between us people and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'you're not gonna get away with it.'
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the remaining supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in downtown.
A number of activists have waved their heads with the "Torians against Brexit" banners after the group launched this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis has been mocking the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with the party's app during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology to plan for Canada plus plus, for a safe border situation, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future Saturday at a live audience in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was vice president of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's been at the center of speculation for some time now that she might be able to stand up to Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's Holyoke meeting was her 36th meeting with the public since Trump took office.
The judge asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means a woman at the helm.
Arrested for the murder of LSU's Sims
Baton Rouge, La., police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims that occurred Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information about the arrest of Dytheon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at an ET news conference.
On Friday, they released a video of the murder, asking for help identifying the man from the video.
Sims, 20, was killed early Friday near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result", Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, 247sports.
Wayde got involved to defend his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene of the crime and possessing a weapon and to killing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-8 third-year senior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games in his first 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes and 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching the world title after order ensures him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Walter Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that the team order would play a big part in the race.
From the starting position, Bottas got off to a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton to enter the market on the pitch, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the boxing one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a wheel-to-wheel action which caused the Ferrari driver to accidentally leave the interior free in danger of falling behind after a double move in the third-corner defence.
Max Verstappen started from the bottom line and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race as he gave up his tires to reach the fast finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally made it to the boxes in round 44, but failed to accelerate his pace in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's been a rough day because Walter's been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he's a real gentleman letting me through.
The team did a really remarkable job of completing the training, Hamilton said.
That was very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she had not released a letter to Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Addressing a gathering in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were both ugly and dishonest.
The only thing that can happen and the only nice thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, ugly and dishonest, he said.
When you look at the public releases and leaks, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you released the information?
Remember her response... did you release the document to the public?
- No, I'm not.
I didn't.
Wait a minute. I'll get you a second.
Did we let... no, we didn't, he added imitating the senator.
A letter to Senator Feinstein was sent in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and leaked earlier in September -- but Feinstein denied that the information came from her office.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't release her story", Feinstein told the board, reports The Hill.
She asked me to keep her secret, and I kept her secret, which she asked for.
However, her denial did not come to the approval of the president, who commented at a meeting on Saturday night: 'Let me tell you something - it was a very bad body speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life.
Continuing his defense of a Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use those accusations for their own ends.
They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see the evil, the ugliness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to get to power and control, the president's words, MediaTimes reports.
The Dundee Stars five to three Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars have redeemed themselves by defeating the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a 5-3 win at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants came up ahead of two-point field goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier in the early minutes.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a tie, and then Dwyer returned the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured the win.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for the Adam Keefe team, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants had won their previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, with Kendall McFaull assisting, with David Rutherford assisting to double the lead with Beauvilleer's lead four minutes later.
In a hectic opening game, Sullivan returned home team to the game at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie's tie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished first with a lead when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first quarter.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard led them to another tie in the strength-forward goal-scoring at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen lead Dundee to the top of the second quarter, and he took the lead with his team already halfway through the final third of the game for the fifth time.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are hosting the Milton Keynes team for the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board the aircraft escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero after he died while ensuring the safe flight of hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died, and many are believed to be missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Paluu.
But despite his colleagues running away to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, which was sliding sharply.
He stayed to ensure the safe take-off of the Batik Air aircraft on flight 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper reached Palua.
"Our hearts are breaking for this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency says access to Donggali, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is believed to be still rising, as many bodies are still under the rubble and many could not be reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching up to six meters [60 feet] high destroyed the Paalo, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "She drives ambulances every minute they bring bodies in.
The government is running out of clean water.
There's a lot of small shops being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in search of survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pala on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
An airline that owns the plane that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims one man is missing after it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
In its statement, Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon they can't track any of the passengers.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to track down the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized Saturday and all are in stable condition.
What caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to break through the water that ran their way to the exit in case of a plane that sank.
He said the stewardesses panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to repair the harbor also helped rescue by using a float boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 30 feet [30 m] of water.
The Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them were involving Air Niugini.
Analyst's putting out a timeline of the night the woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors on Saturday completed a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described using cell phone data to solve a puzzle about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got location information from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which is contrary to his previous claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the records showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to interrogate Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because his truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The cell phone records showed they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, some time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense should start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
What is enlightened hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to challenge a negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based singing group The High Breed claim that hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and a focus on social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Commona are reborn in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York nanny sues a couple for breaking up after a racist message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory termination after receiving a misdirected text from her mother calling her "a young black girl".
The couple denies they're racist, comparing the charge to rape.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016 to learn that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"There is only one more black woman", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a letter to her husband.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a very uncomfortable situation, and she fired Mrs. Maurice, because, she claims, their then-former nanny, who was African-American, was doing her job poorly, and that she was expecting the Philippines instead, reports the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for severance pay and seeking $350 a day for the six-month period for which she was originally engaged, though without a contract.
I want to show them that they can't do such things", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to claims that they were racist, saying that it was reasonable to terminate Mauricia's employment, fearing that she would be unlikely to be trusted by an insult.
My wife didn't mean what she sent her in the text.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist, Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
But would you entrust your children to someone you have been rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Let's go.
Plasco said his wife only got two months of maternity leave after the baby was born and that she was in a very difficult situation.
You're going to sue someone who's in that situation.
"That's not very nice", added the investment banker.
Although the court case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the social media couple, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not identify with the talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes before the book is published.
It's very funny what we now know about Paddington's huge success.
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a little teddy bear to write a children's book, would be optimistic if his work were rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as a very important member of the family, she added that her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn't a boastful man, she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it all felt like a child's achievement: you're proud of him even though none of it was actually your work.
I think that's how Paddington's success was viewed.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always credited Paddington with the merits.
My daughter was dying, and we had to say goodbye over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"He'd called regularly to say he was really bad and to believe he wouldn't make it", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me to tell me she was gonna die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be joining you soon.
I'll join you.
The medications that her doctors gave her to keep her heart functioning slowly lost their effectiveness and left her body system.
She died just before boarding, and then everything went out.
I just had to sit back and wait, knowing what was coming.
I couldn't scream, I couldn't scream or I couldn't cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it all inside.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the trials she was going through.
No one knew, she said.
I lowered my head, and tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt a strong feeling of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Messages from mourners on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up cards on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at 18 he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a chef with an infectious smile who was expected to have a brilliant career.
Everyone remembered him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy.
However, before his death, he left the job because he was in a really dark state.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it will have a negative effect".
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea with the cards so people would know that there is someone you can go to and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don't sit in silence. You need to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything like that", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas, he was at the bottom of the sea when the kids opened the presents, not looking them in the eye or wanting anything else.
She said that his death was a great trauma, but that they had to get over it:
He's throwing us out.
But we'll go on and fight.

The future of Bret Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought we might be able to bring in a little unity if we really could get something like what he was asking for" "a time-limited and extensive investigation", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would collapse amid a rooting party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their nausea is fueled by the choice of moment.
The midterm elections are coming in just five weeks, November 6th. If, as expected, the Republicans don't do well, then they'll be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to run for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush constantly calls on senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes their report?
It's going to be voted on in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break through the deciding vote and confirm his seat on the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean escapees "falling" under Kim
The number of North Korean flights to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the United Nations Southern Affairs Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1127 breaches last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors were tougher controls at the North Korean-Chinese border crossing and higher tariffs smugglers are charging people.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most of the North Korean refugees eventually became South Korean citizens.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them violently.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stalemate of denuclearization negotiations.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broader sense to work on the Korean Peninsula's nuclear weapons liberation.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean foreign minister, blamed U.S. sanctions for not making any progress since.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it is not in our mind that under such circumstances we are the first to disarm", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he's incapable of serving on the Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that her temperament made her unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that a woman, if she ever behaved like this, would be called hysterical", Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the introduction, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking as he discussed his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him "grotesque and coordinated smear" organized by the liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the work of the Supreme Court because he showed prejudice against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi backed down.
I'm going to say the following. If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's incapable not only of being in the Supreme Court, but in the court he's in now, Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law stemming from Roe v. Wade because she considered herself a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh has omitted questions about whether he will reverse some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"It's not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Is that more beautiful,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with this.
Reasonable criticism, anger that has accumulated for months and years... all of this can't be avoided without tears.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Stein told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual.
She continued: "I've been greatly helped by a woman who was once the CEO and who said that she cries when she's angry, but she developed a technique that when she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person she's talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry with you.
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great.
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, is that one time, when I was crying out of inexpressible anger, an elderly woman, a cold manager, who I was always a little afraid of, dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be happy because they think they hit you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider running for president.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn't need another one.
Someone called them the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign was already delayed, she lagged behind in fundraising, vowing not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her fans, who gave men $1,000, gave her only $250.
Did they think I had a discount?
As she said she would not run a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it harder to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism -- that her throat squeezed.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown, Mrs. Schroeder recalled the media's reaction to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd put on my tombstone.
She cried.
How a trade war between the US and China can be good for Beijing
The start of the US-China trade war has been a resounding one, and while the battle is far from over, the rift between the countries could be of benefit to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, actually taxing half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has responded in some way every time, and recently, tariffs of five to ten percent have been imposed on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to strike back at the United States, and the world's second-largest economy is not about to surrender.
Washington's withdrawal could be achieved by easing demands, but public submission to the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the US trade war could provide long-term positive support to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic collapse in both countries is actually far more dangerous than observers believed", said Abigail Grace, a strategic think tank associate with the Center for a New American Security focused on Asia.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help in rebuilding the country devastated by the war that has been raging for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks to restore the normal situation.
Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were directed at their daily lives and existence are met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be well served with help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating team USA by a final score of 16.5 ̶ 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has lost six straight European Championships and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjørn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was struggling for most of the tournament, on the 16th hole pair 3, sent the ball into the water on the first shot, leaving the game to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all rounds and became one of only four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth has kicked out Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest-ranked player in the European team, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the European with the most victories in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop the tears.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win the cup again.
I'm happy I could help, Garcia said, full of emotion after the European victory.
He's carrying the torch to his compatriot John Ramm who in a single game on Sunday beat legendary American golfer Tiger Woods by a score of 2&1.
"I'm incredibly proud of winning over Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic by one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, and is right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the whole weekend struggling to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, American captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At certain moments we have provided resistance to Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll negotiate, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take your hat off to the people.
We're upgraded.
New red tide data: Concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) shows an overall reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay.
The FWC states that conditions for heterogeneous algae flowering are being reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties ̶ indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide extends about 130 miles along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
Flowering areas can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
Red tide was also seen in Pasco County.
In the past week, moderate concentrations have been recorded in Pinellas County or its coastal area, low to high concentrations in Hillsborough County coastal area, common to high concentrations in Manatee County, common to high concentrations in Sarasota County or its coastal area, common to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, common to high concentrations in Lee County or its coastal area, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Cases of respiratory distress continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory system swelling has been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
