Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly.
The two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran’s destabilizing actions in the Middle East.
The meeting will also discuss the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been striking for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s continuing settlements and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The Obama proposed deal on the Iranian nuclear program has further deteriorated the relations of the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu held a controversial speech before the U.S. Congress, which was partly considered an opposition to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency call, professor acknowledges having shot his girlfriend.
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a slightly silent voice that he shot his girlfriend and that officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and likely excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a hand-written note that was criticized on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted, I could make it backward, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
There was no evidence that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school ground, where he, according to the police, shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff had heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said that Lamb made the horrible emergency call at some point afterwards.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamm took his life when the police caught him.
One day after the university shooting, which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were delighted with his lesson.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote in which he mentioned the “wonderful people” with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty comprises 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave for health reasons, saying he had any health problems.
This year he only taught two online courses.
The latest changes in the employment policy of the University mean that the doctorate for which Lamb had worked so hard would not represent a guarantee for him for an automatic way to a job as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn’t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “naturally there was something in Mr Lamb’s idea.”
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping from the campus, the police later found Lamb's trace when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the back yard of a house about a mile south of his hometown on the Greenville coast, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still on the entrance.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work in 2009 at the University, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogics.
He graduated in Pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lambs’ long-standing friends called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20, when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were at high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the woman at that time.
All the girls gathered there when he was there,” said Hairston, now 40 and residing in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Princess were obviously together for a while.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no document of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the Backstein House, which is bound to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
Prince's former husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends remained and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was completely destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer-year market three years ago.
Later they played together the one or the other Gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a poorly illuminated bar near Gautier, said he had seen Lamb and Prentiss Night in the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmony game in front of a spacious audience.
There were no signs that something was wrong.
“It’s just a happy couple,” he said.
We were cleaning and joking with each other.
I think they both had a good sense of glory.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first-semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous people and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was chairman of his Brotherhood and Student Committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including teachers, staff, students and community members, attended a candle light memorial ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and her brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the memorial, while the university chore singed "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The class will be reopened on Wednesday.
“We are trying to move our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt, and that Lamm in his emergency call named Princess as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to set off fewer workers for Christmas time
Toys R Us says it will not hire as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby product dealer says it will give the staff and season workers currently employed with it a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country. in the Christmas time of 2014, another 45,000 workers were hired.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start with application talks this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire time employees to equip shops with employees who sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox laughs about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The movie begins, and it comes to my mind that I’m a simulated tune and a arm length away from being with the princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
“Back for the Future” was released 30 years ago.
“It’s really for me,” Spielberg said, “unfortunately the greatest time travel film ever filmed.”
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” to the almost five-year conflict, and more weapons will just worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN head again urges all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said on a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council – the United States, Russia, China, the UK and France – at the edge of the General Assembly’s ministerial meeting even this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "making this situation unresolved."
Ban urged the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria as they have shown in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Survey values that show that Donald Trump should be taken seriously.
Some have tried to mark him as a flop.
Others took it as a joke.
Some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the upper ranges in the surveys, it has (not yet) failed.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump lead in the two-cylinder area, and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the possibilities of nomination of the real estate bulk.
Of course, it is too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at that time in 2011 Rick Perry was given leadership to the emerging Herman Cain, no one of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general choice.
But external groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump’s sustainability and begin to let their dollars flow to collapse him.
Here are some up-to-date survey values that indicate that the real estate is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University survey showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate volume positively.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52%.
Now six of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers remain in early states.
A Quinnipiac referendum in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of the Republicans have a good opinion about Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said they would either be “enthusiastic” or “happy” if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they’d be “burned” if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates approximately the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” vs. 40 percent say the same about Trump).
Next about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio is 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say they would be "unhappy" or "righted" if Jeb Bush, the establishment's favourite, was the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Republican Irish voters believe the real estate has the right temperament for a president, ABC News/Washington Post said Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to effectively carry out his office, and almost six out of 10 independent people say that his temperament doesn’t fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to the idea.
When they set up their scholarship, Republican voters consider Trump real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC survey last week.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four of the ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against just 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
However, it turns out that a variety of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gather for another candidate, Trump still tries almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the split field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusly distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump raises the majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It’s a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to hit him.
Ben Carson would overcome the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that just a little more than half of voters who support Trump say they have firmly forgiven their votes.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change your opinion.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
However, Trump’s strongest competition at the moment is the other outside party, the neurochirurgist Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “violent” in his election campaign two months ago, immigration has been a point of view in the 2016 public speech.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic expression will keep decisive Hispano-Americans away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post survey on Monday, six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as the immigration remains in the light of the ramp, it seems that Donald Trump will do it too.
The frustration over the government rises to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now deprived of approximately half of the Republican voters’ support, especially because of their foreign status.
Six of 10 Republicans say in ABC/Post’s new Monday survey they prefer a political foreign leader than someone with government experience.
They are angry on Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unhappy" and 21 percent "healthy angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co: The Five Most Exclusive Residents of Germany
Here on Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential facility - with views over the northern sea waters.
On the road, a square meter of a railway house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited," the study says - that's why the high price.
A new study shows in which special areas a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student building in Munich are not really little.
Unlike the top resorts in Germany, one of the prices comes like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential places - with square meters of prices at swindling heights.
There are a few tens of thousands of euros - per square meter, well noticed.
Well, who can afford it...
Unfortunately, Munich is not at the top.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-time shooting in Pyrenees: Bayern star Thomas Müller has just a run.
A lucky defeat by Thomas Müller set the FC Bayern the way to a winning 3-0 at Olympiakos Piräus - then it went.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the hunt of Piräus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their starting game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götzes's score (89.) earned 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start-up in the series will be the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola in the third round will finally take the Henkelpott to Munich.
Müller received in his 28th match in the Champions League to the leadership of Bayern kindly with the help of Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who made one shot thought of the world champion pass.
"We will not underestimate them," Bavarian captain Philipp Lahm promised before the game at Karaiskakis Stadium before 31,688 hot-blood fans - and the Munichers held the word.
They showed a concentrated and committed idea, without shining.
Piréus had won his last six home matches in the royal class, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also scored (1:3).
But the Bayern, unbeaten in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They ran courageously, but in their offensive efforts often to work unfortunately.
The attacks were too often initiated by a game shift on the left side of Douglas Costa, who rarely passed through against the former Braunschweig Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more lucky from the right side than his flanke from the right half in the left upper toreck.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2-0.
The best chances in half one was Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos shooter Ideye Brown hit the headball of Poland from the line (26.).
Then by direct take, the Torwart Roberto paried with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians used to rise their dominant game, Piräus was able to put a needle stick.
However, Manuel Neuer was abandoned.
So, for example, when he directed a shot of Ideye over the latte (56).
Before New, Guardiola left a four-chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did it well.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems back in the frame, first sat out.
The world champion has only given green light after the final training, Sports Director Matthias Sammer told Sky: "Whoever wants to do something different from it, it's already malicious."
Also at the first shift, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the attacked Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76), and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by eleven meters Müller put another one on it.
Before the game it was in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially confused Bavarian fans appeared to have provoked the fans of the host Piräus with words and gestures in their audience block, security forces attacked and walked with strikes against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing their teeth.
Those who smoke hurt not only the lungs, but also the teeth – this is a Potsdamer long-term study.
The good news is that if you give up, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the result of a long-term study by an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at a risk of losing their teeth prematurely, 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
Scientists have observed more than 23300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the tooth, the DIfE emphasizes.
For this parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
Therefore, the connection between smoking and tooth loss leads to more frequent tooth inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear how smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it may take over ten years to get the danger back to the level of non-smokers, first author Thomas Dietrich from the University of Birmingham said.
People must be convinced to become non-smokers, said study leader Heiner Boeing from the DIfE: “Roking shortenes life.”
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health up to old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE.
Earlier studies have already shown that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study underlines the findings.
Archaeologists encounter Kölner Rheinufer on remains from the late antiquity
Archaeological discoveries have been made on the right Rhine River in Cologne.
Near the building site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum have grabbed the skeletons and remains of historic buildings, said museum manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called soil patterns.
For all the construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always added as a specialist office for Archaeological Land Painting Care.
In the third building of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
Text documents have already been known that there were a fortress in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 tombs was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman captured from cargo train
After a young woman is missing at the Gilenkirchen-Lindern railway station, the federal police asks the people for help.
Early Wednesday morning at 1.40 p.m. the woman crossed the trail from the railway station building coming at the end of the railway and was captured by a cargo train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By the arrest of the train, she suffered serious injuries, according to the federal police.
She was hospitalized and brought to a hospital by rescue forces.
The reason for the nightly trail passage of the young woman is not available to the investigating officers.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Questions come from residents or passengers of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information about the cause of the accident can be provided at the free hotline of the Federal Police at the phone 0800/6888000 or any other police service.
The European Commission proposes a new court on TTIP
To resolve the dispute on the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private settlement facilities for disputes between companies and states should therefore be resolved by a more transparent system, which in its way of functioning corresponds significantly to more traditional courts.
“We want to establish a system that the citizens trust,” EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said in a statement.
The Swedish government intends to incorporate the proposal as a European negotiating position into the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced its support.
TTIP is the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current arbitration specifically show that EU countries and the United States will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are expected to come in equal parts from the EU, the United States and third countries.
For the first time, a second instance is planned.
It would allow it to object to judgments.
So far, the parties agreed with each other on judges, there was no objection to their judgments.
In the discussions of the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long run, it is intended to work on an International Investment Court.
There, for example, could also be resolved disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries.
The Investor-State Divorce Procedure (ISDS), which is demanded by large companies, is considered one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, about which companies can allow compensation to taxpayers, impose national laws or impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In their first opinions, anti-TTIP organizations such as Campact described the EU Commission’s proposals as insufficient.
It was criticized above all that it should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
German Economic State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) called the plans a major progress.
The Commission takes into account the key points of the reform that Federal Minister of Economy Sigmar Gabriel discussed in the spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration courts is from the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström’s plans.
The European Business Association, BusinessEurope, warned that it would limit the potential for complaints by too many new rules.
Especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be damaged by this, he said.
When the negotiations on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) will be concluded, remains unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
The issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year.
This date is considered no longer durable.
Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on the stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now: Luxor).
Beside him is a flipchart on which the scary folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with a flipstift.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost captured by Stevens' speech.
He tells through different places, which he repeatedly notes on the map, about which his subtle and tightly arranged songs report.
Where they were born and how it looks there, in his home.
Since then, Stevens has demonstrated himself as a wonderful creative fool.
With the 2003 edition and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" appear smart composed songs that harmonically blink very close to the American folk of the late sixties, but can at any time run into great opulent.
The rumor arises that “Michigan” would be the first part of a series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be announced in a row.
But already in 2004 and near Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks some expectations positively.
Stevens is reduced here.
There is enough guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") a full-fledged masterpiece appears in 2005.
Overflowing with ideas and stylistic finess.
The album runs into the American Billboard Charts and is not missing in any of the year's best lists of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then serves on "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic spare parts.
This sixth ordinary studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
As long as the smaller clubs rise away, the Bühnenshows here become a colourful spectacle of neon headbands and a large fluorescent Bühnendeko.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens is a part of a fifth band touring through Germany.
In the dark holded hamburger more!
Theatre is mainly presenting the "Carrie & Lowell" that has been available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs, the clearly mature Stevens returns to intimity and popularity.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widespread enriched album.
From the audience, you hear that the lecture is “opulter” and you can thus “throw the plate in principle”.
Only for one addition, Stevens thanks himself modestly, acoustically plays a few older songs, and eventually denies himself under doubling applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut is expected at the Prime Minister's questioning with tension
The new Labour chairman, Jeremy Corbyn, will give his debut at the Prime Minister's query and start with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six asked questions shortly after lunch, with his performance likely being examined by the media and the Labour members from close.
He called for “less theater and more facts” at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr. Corbyn’s leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour chairman’s decision to keep in silence on Tuesday during the singing of the National Anthem at a celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism by a number of Tory MPs and is at the heart of several titled stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national song has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he had "stained in respectful silence" and he recognized "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air struggle for England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour president to sing the national hymn, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn's top team, and they appeal on differences in the economy, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences “stap” within labor as well, according to Mr. Corbyn’s statements on the position on the European Union and the limitation of winnings.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is proposing changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation as a whole.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow-work and retirement minister, said that the party is “very clear” that it is only against the government’s plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman that David Cameron has been facing over the dispatch box in parliament in the last decade since he has been Tory chairman.
The Labour chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP said that the Prime Minister's questioning is too confrontative, and that he will both "shock skill" and the struggle with rejection, and instead decided to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Economy Minister will represent him if he does not participate - for example, when Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also brought the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word, and that he addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the house, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to get away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle Theatre" which is often linked to the Prime Minister's question.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the question with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Representatives and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it has become a cartoon and requires extensive reforms.
'Shot in Joburg': homeless youths trained to photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a hard place if you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn the maintenance.
"I what shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youths how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds Increase due to Accelerated Wage Growth in the UK
The pound rose sharply according to data showing an increase in UK wage growth. Parallel to this, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller target.
Between May and July, the bonus-free outcome in the United Kingdom increased by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest and most estimated rate since 2009.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and climbed to €1,3730 against the euro by 0.84%.
The FTSE 100 index ended with a rise of 1.49% to 6.229,21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a jump of 20%, after the acquisition offer was received by the rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest brewery in the world and bring together brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher, according to encouraging news from the competitive luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – remarked growth.
Glencore’s shares rose by 5 percent after the miner said he took $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a drop of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had put his rating for the company rating on "sales".
JD Sports increased by 3.1 percent after the sports clothing company had a pre-tax outcome of 46.6 million for the six months.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages threaten expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.”
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will balance the higher labour costs at his company, he says.
The costs could hit the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the Capital: On Bieber's Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber and Megastar.
21 years old, a young man with a thick hair.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
And even more.
Mr. Bieber is currently in Berlin.
The U17 is going through.
as Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name Ritz Carlton.
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
However, since 7 a.m. the Polin is sitting on the cold stone plates in front of the Berliner Luxushotel on the Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber Building: Here is your idol, whose poster is hanging in Stettin, since Monday night.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much a day as her mom Ewa deserves in a half year.
If at all.
She says, "In fact, my Victoria should sit in the tenth class in high school."
“I will realize a dream.”
The school obligation?
Who is it?
The fans not.
Not even Bieber himself.
He was careful anyway.
For the advertising in the Superbow's advertising break, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company wrapped many, many dollars on the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the loading table, Bieber also cuts.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you’re surprised at the window plate.
More than a hundred million people have been invested in this way.
Some say the hype went too far.
Other emphasize, Bieber is finally just in the United States and the UK with his new single "What do you mean?" on the 1st place.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is scheduled to follow in November, is not interested in the many null first time.
At least he does so.
Pegida Plakat Brings Libanese on Potato Money Idea
Potatoes or Döner?
Both are in the potato currency developed by Oldenburger imbiss owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the phrase "cartoffle instead of Döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay has put potatoes and meat together on a stick.
The idea brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Cappuccino instead of Döner", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, a grill spice is turned in his store, filled with meat and potatoes.
“This is multicultural for the stomach,” says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
There, according to the authorities, it has been protected as a pattern of use.
So how much meat and how many potatoes the spice contains, Alhay does not want to betray.
Just so much: “It smells together even better,” he finds.
The culinary understanding of the people is also good for its customers.
Metcash Starts Ground Resistance Campaign to Combat Aldi Invasion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesale Metcash has launched a ground-resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia before a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing for the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice cream manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and store owners who sell the licensed tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the wholesale for food, alcohol and equipment carries out its annual Investor Strategy Day.
South Australia and Western Australia account for 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA shares and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the East States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorious provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the East States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after opening its first markets, Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two states and take away sales to all existing actors, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in SA and 30 in WA next year and will a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and food business and the amounts on Metcash’s high fixed cost base could cost Metcash around $13 million profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the East States, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan survey found that IGA buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash’s food and food sales will decline by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and the market share will decrease from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr. Douglass's comments.
But it is supposed that a board member of Metcash has contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has decreased from 18 percent since 2010 to 14 percent, and Metcash’s food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has decreased by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational debt decrease with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins.
The wholesaler, however, defends and invests more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths at hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by rapidly growing fresh food and delivering a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash’s chief executive Ian Morrice says the price adjustments and store repair programmes will lead to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Australian tennis club president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "colateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the Australian Tennis Association president Steve Healy, he deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", is thrown into the light by the famous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fireful qualification game in Cincinnati soon after that, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the judge, with Harrison saying, "Wawrinka had to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen as he hit a tennis player after a cramp eradicated a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the second place in individual behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against the UK.
“One thing I’m quite aware of is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a bit involved in the dispute,” Healy said.
He broke a striker when he lost because of a cramp in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break a striker from frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the quite provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a little too strictly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the clothing area, he trains hard, he is good in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into consideration in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the “common decision” as the right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixed component.”
“First, we want the team to be fully focused on competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick has succeeded very quickly in the rise, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out of. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time outside the ramp light, in which he can only think about it, I think it’s suitable, and it’s best for the team and it’s the best for him.
European refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes the border, holds refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and climbed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those trying to come illegally into the country.
Chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a country of no one and Serbian officials reacted with enthusiasm.
The people who had escaped from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built cells and settled there.
But frustrations are rising.
As a police helicopter drove over them, the migrants scanded "Open the border!" and screamed offenses against the Hungarian willingness police.
Some protested food and water.
Serbia’s Foreign Minister said it was “unacceptable” that migrants would be returned from Hungary, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels failed to agree on a joint immigration policy.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking asylum in the overwhelmed Italy and Greece. they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would receive another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.
However, Hungary did not put its hopes on a short action from Brussels or its neighbors.
On Tuesday, the emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis, so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also plans to build a stainless steel plant along its border to Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it finished a plant on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata that even prison prisoners were used in the race to create the steel-trait underground between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become a significant gateway and entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that the majority of the coming are economic refugees seeking a better life, and not war refugees seeking protection – a view that is strongly contrary to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4 meters (13 feet) high ground that the government built along the southern border to Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher prison penalties for condemned human traffickers.
"Given the situation arising from mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
The parliament still has to approve the military operation, which is expected for the next week, but reporters from Associated Press have seen heavy-armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, National Security Adviser for Orban, said that the authorities caught 45 people in the attempt to cross the border, 15 others had already entered the country deeper.
They come through by damaging the gardens, they are now in police guard and are accused of committing crimes according to the new laws.
The authorities are trying to repair the garden quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday after a train wagon had arrived with steel trail to close the border.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pushed a crowd to enter there.
About 20 were able to enter, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton’s advance over Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to keep a two-point advance in the democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins against her on ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the Democratic voters in the pre-election (58 percent before), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (a rise of 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is a candidate for the presidential office, receives the support of 15 percent of the Democratic voters in the presidential election.
More than five months before the pre-election starts, most democratic voters say it’s too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they’re going to support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more persistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey, Clinton has lost in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has earned some profits.
Clinton holds a great advance among women and moderate, but these advances have decreased.
Their support among men has declined significantly, and Sanders is behind here with only 5 points.
Clinton’s advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has flattered, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
But Clinton still has a major advance among the elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with two-point advance in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point advance in this group.
Approximately half of the Democratic voters in the presidential elections across the country say they would be enthusiastically supporting Clinton if she was nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support her only because she is the candidate.
6 percent would not support.
Per it’s not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are especially excited about her.
The views are stronger mixed among those who currently don’t support Clinton – only about a quarter would be enthusiastically supporting her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters in the pre-election say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the opinion that it’s time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she’s the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned their relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent on dealing with the problems and optionality are also quoted.
Since the Vice-President is throwing a potential for the presidential office into the scale, 57 percent of the Democratic voters in the presidential election want to see him in the race – although a third believes he shouldn’t do it.
When democratic voters are asked who would be their second election for the party, Biden is on the top.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say that Biden's second choice would be far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to candidate for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton’s advance over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, this number has dropped by 78 percent in the last month.
Biden is the second in this measurement with a distance, but the percentage that sees it as the "best" has increased.
However, when asked what’s more important for a candidate, Democratic voters ask questions about votability.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate appears to be unacceptable for these pre-election voters.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results in some of the key features of voters in the pre-election of their party.
The majority considers Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden cuts off the three candidates best in honesty, while Clinton’s strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of democratic voters don’t believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t have any opinion about him.
Democratic voters in the pre-election generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are still being asked during the term as a Foreign Minister, most Democratic voters of the pre-election are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions in general.
But it’s a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third is satisfied.
The public opinion was divided about this in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions about Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinions about her had worsened.
There are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered to be honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party, this remains a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters don’t think they’re an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country see Trump as unfair and unreliable.
However, Clinton and Trump get good scores in leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush cut off best in honesty.
A majority sees Sanders rather than honest, but like Carson, many don’t have any opinion about him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the pre-election is 6 percent points.
Ben Carson is closely behind Donald Trump during a national investigation
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
On the two candidates, half of the voters’ support in the new survey is now missing, and others are dramatically losing a stop.
The support is growing from 23% in the last CBS survey, which was conducted before Fox News debate last month, to 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson scored from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is good among demographic groups and Trump is superior among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is defeated with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen deepest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are on the third place with 6%.
The error margin in the 376 people's sample of Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson is rising in the surveys - he is falling with 19% support from the Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
Looking at a Carson that rises last week, Trump found some side hips for the former neurochirurg, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said on Saturday during a campaign show in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees.
Even though the top values are measured only from a distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is already enough for swimmers to find warm water.
A bath in the North or the Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some do not go to the sea: the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
Bad temperatures, however, continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adria it is at the top of 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College Neulings
Nearly two years after a student died during a shocking ritual of a student bond in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder claims are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police.
Officers said he was loaded with a 30-pound sand-filled backpack with connected eyes and was repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained about headaches, then he died unconsciously.
Members of the Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood didn't call the emergency number 911 after Deng became impotent and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng’s clothes, to google his symptoms, and to contact the national president of the Brotherhood, Andy Meng, to seek advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and put the good of the Brotherhood basically above that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died of his injury the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with stupid strength injury to the head, rubber and spine.
"A lot of families have been destroyed by the shock of the Brotherhood. at least one student has died from the shock since 1970 each year," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents the Deng family, in a statement.
Brotherhood and its members must be taken into account, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an accusation for third-degree murder for the first five members.
Twenty-three members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with scandalous attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We don't just want to make the people involved responsible, but if there's an organization that - officially or informally - has sanctioned this, we'll also take responsibility for it," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its membership in the local group.
This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates.
An increase in interest will come, and the houses will fall down, returns for bonds will rise, and the economy will move into a recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it all will last and how long it will last.
In particular, the history for the economy provides only a small guide to the course.
A recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate rise and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, but not always, a factor in how the economy and financial institutions react.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when they begin to raise interest rates, but rather on the period required for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end, however, market participants could find that all the excitement due to an increase in interest rates may have been exaggerated.
“Fed’s first rise since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money,” said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a statement to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal levels, but still to a low level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effects.
Here is a history-based look at how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen in the last month, anticipating interest rates can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency that asset contracts are reversed 12 to 24 months after the first rise, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Fed’s interest rate increases.
More specifically, the market is mostly in the upward trend over the last 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rise, quite flat in the 250 days afterwards (medium profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal condition after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the rise cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that had not existed before and which could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely remarkable here that the GDP will be close to its lowest point when the Fed raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 interest rates since 1950, the nominal GDP was only twice below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, few expect that this will continue and expect for the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed, only 1.5 percent.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic collapse could be risky and raise the question "if this time it is different," the Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been focused on a year-round interest rise by the Fed, and all the eyes were directed to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the Futures trading shows only a 25% probability.
“In our study, all the rise cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super cycle with an increasing GDP trend and pre-resession heights put in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report says.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is far from the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
The fixed income was also volatile as the market predicts an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic rate.
In the case of bonds, the returns appear to change the direction as soon as the first rise/reduction occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the rise cycle, the loan rates fall immediately, the Deutsche Bank said.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer cohesion of returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a deflation of the curve.
High-percentage bonds often bring better revenue in such a climate, although "we are still cautious to expect higher revenue," said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed’s strategy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a stricter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the revenue curve is flat, credit rates have expanded and volatility has increased – all the features of the market when the Fed strengthens its strategy.
Overall, companies that operate most of their business in the U.S. will benefit from this as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market as well as the financing of their debt.
“The story shows that ‘quality’ shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate rise,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer report.
Companies with strong balance sheets have exceeded the average of 5 percent points after each of the interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital revenues and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality revenues by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher revenue, even if experts are different on how quickly it will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says parliamentary member Andrew Bingham
The Conservative member of the Parliament criticized the broadcaster for his "depletion"
He argues that he is increasingly unlikely to be distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they only imitated the Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "transforms" into Classic FM, claims a leading parliamentary member and increases new pressure on the radio, to prove that he does something that the private radio doesn't do.
Conservative deputy Andrew Bingham also told the BBC boss that the public-law radio broadcaster is "dirty" and increasingly no longer to distinguish from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dumping" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, appear to be The Brits only under a different name.
So, if you’re trying to do something different – these are two spontaneously mentioned examples in which you actually just imitate what’s already on the market,” Mr. Bingham said.
BBC’s Director-General rejected the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness.
What I learn from Radio 3 I will not learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there’s a commitment to live music and music that’s really unbeatable.
“And I really think Radio 3’s commitment to finding new music and ordering new works is important,” he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that more hard work should be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC’s production that during the hearing in the selection committee of culture, media and sport was thrown under fire to put the commercial rivals on foot.
Tory deputy Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
Find out why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not markant?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced "on a special BBC way".
He added that he wishes the company "to find a hit from our home stall" when it starts a entertainment series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series from The Voice in the future or to spend money from the taxpayers for other entertainment formats.
Internet trading increased the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this.
In the first three months of 2015 there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest outcome since the start of records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using cell phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November blocked the spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has emerged, and many of the UK’s main shopping roads have turned into ghost cities.
However, experts say there are now signs that online transactions stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest growth since the beginning of records in 2000, with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous year and go back to 2000, then it has continually evolved over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago as buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people were able to shop online and that people were able to do this in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But now it is pending, and we may see that growth is decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is quoted as a reason for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that buyers keep their purchases back before this event, which takes place each on the last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of buyers turned around their computers five times to make their stakes, and some dealer websites collapsed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, on which buyers fought for scores, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that £5 spending was somewhat more than £1 spent online.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made through web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims buried those killed in Kran crash in Mekka - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse partially on the burden of the giant Saudi Bin Laden group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to buri the dead when a crane collapsed at the Great Mosque of Mekka.
Sad men, largely dressed in white, filled the path to fill their respect as the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sadness process was passed in the Holy Place, where only days before a building crane fell through the roof of the mosque and then on the prayer.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the king of Saudi Arabia imposed a sanction on the building company of the bin Laden family for the catastrophe, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 bears who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mekka were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, a father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hadhch will continue to go to Mekka with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said the Bin-Laden group would not have left the arm of the crane standing when it was not used.
A Arabic version of the decree, which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency, said the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was banned from travel abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the collapse of the cranes, which fell into an interior court of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddash, which will take place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the Krans, and its representatives were not available for a statement.
The Royal Decree also delayed the group because of non-actual security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of rains surround Mekka’s Great Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
Bin Laden’s family has been connected with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a deceased son who was kidnapped by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse of the crane came in the middle of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remained in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million Rial (£174,000) to be paid to the relatives of the dead and the same amount to permanently injured.
Other injured will receive half of that amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britain employs more and more craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen behind
This leads to the opening of 200 more screwfix stores aimed at craftsmen.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q stores across the country
by Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British placed their hammer and pins in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who perform the work in their home.
If you can skillfully deal with a hammer or a pencil to stretch walls, you seem to belong to a minority today.
Because British are increasingly employing craftsmen to perform homework jobs in their homes, the company’s chief behind B&Q said.
Véronique Laury, the new chief executive of Kingfisher, who owns the wood market chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at the lowest prices is now overcome.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops that are aimed at craftsmen and to close 60 B&Q stores.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops as eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, men are overwhelming among employees.
She said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single houses that make more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said: “There’s still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to move this further towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying items by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, one of only five women in the top of a UK listed in the FTSE100 index, has also redirected her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50% of the team with women, including its management and financial board.
Mrs. Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher a decrease in half-year profits and revenue after the group charged the costs for closing the shops.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new shops.
Aich/Dob officials for unfaithfulness in court
On Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice-Master Aich/Dob have been sentenced to court in Klagenfurt for misconduct and tax evasion.
The accused did not recognize themselves guilty.
One of them was also charged with abuse.
He was legally released from the accusation in May.
The current process has been delayed.
According to Supreme Attorney Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it was crystallized that in the years 2006-2011, the accused used funds from association accounts, over which they were allowed to dispose in their functions, for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at approximately 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also charged with financial crimes.
This fact was dismissed by the Chairman of the Opening Council, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later time.
For the defending of the unreliance, the defense stated that the association had at no time created a share of assets.
The sports officials had only charged remunerations and withdrawn the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt – the passives amounted in 2001 to about 600,000 shillings ($44,000).
"Then we were faced with the situation: will we continue to lead the club or will we block it?", said one of the accused, in the bread business, the financial office's large-scale auditor.
With his colleagues and colleagues, he decided to take this task.
with all risks.
“We’ve launched money, put our life insurance as a security at the bank,” he said at the reception.
It has been agreed with the association: you can freely manage the money, there is only no debt to be made.
Furthermore, in the case of the corresponding financial success, the payment of the remuneration compensation was recurrently decided until 1991.
Therefore, a part of the compensation was paid only years later, namely since 2003, when a plus had been on the account.
Therefore, passive and not detailed bookings also appeared, the former Obmann explained the processes.
The accounts and savings were managed by the two accused together, the second accused said.
Why the payments were not detailed to the association, the judge asked.
The association has not been interested in the financial burden in detail, only the freedom of debt was important, so the answer.
In 2011, when an official was investigated for abuse, an amount of €120,000 was transferred to the association account.
This was a storage, the accused said.
This securities account was on the name of the second accused and, according to his statement, was not known to the association.
“Why?” the judge wanted to know.
The respondent did not know the answer for a long time.
After all, he said he believed that this was the best for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about that money, the prosecutor put into the room.
The accused was informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "reparation of damages".
Why do you want to know the judge and the prosecutor?
The first accused said he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "With it you are all out of the cutting."
“Are I a legal representative?” he asked.
Furthermore, the official said he had never received a penny salary, he had only charged kilometers of money and diets.
On diets he charged the association €1,000 a month, but the actual cost was much higher, he added.
The accused did not provide accurate documents for the early years.
These were no longer preserved after an operation check in which everything was considered correct, they explained.
Kilometre money was also received by the second accused.
All remittances were made in cash, he had to go from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he said in a statement.
The main trial will continue on September 23 with the interrogation of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard gets 30,000 jobs
In addition to the three-year decrease of staff, the computer rise will decrease further jobs in the division of the company.
The job streams at the U.S. computer company Hewlett-Packard (HP) are not ending.
In the framework of its restructuring, the U.S. Technology Group plans to cut down from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client share.
This will save costs of $2.7 billion ($2.4 billion), the company said on Tuesday.
The move will lead to a special burden of approximately $2.7 billion, which will fall from the fourth quarter.
The decrease of 55,000 jobs in the last three years has not yet been completed.
At the end of the financial year 2013/14, HP still employed about 302,000 employees.
The Hewlett-Packard stock dropped 2.3 percent.
The printing group of Palo Alto, California, is now dividing: this is how the computer and printing business is to be connected into a new society – separated from the future areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both shares are to be registered on the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC range, as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services, put the second-largest PC manufacturer in the world after Lenovo.
In the third business quarter, at the end of July, the sales of PCs and printers fell by 11.5 percent.
The turnover fell by 8 percent to just $25.4 billion.
This resulted in a decline in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP is responding with a split and massive jobs spread to the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has only late reacted to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans predict a total reduction of about 55,000 jobs.
Conflict: The majority supports the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly be rejected: 54 percent opposed and 35 percent agreed.
That other states are flying air attacks against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, 61 percent find positive.
24 percent are against interfering in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad was rejected by 51 percent of respondents, and 20 percent would be for.
29 percent did not decide.
Auto: Second Press Day at the 66th IAA
At the heart of the exhibition will be connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until September 27.
After two press days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto “Mobility Connects” on Thursday.
The broad audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the Auto-Association VDA are expecting about 900,000 visitors as two years ago.
Röszke: Violence breaks on the Serbian-Hungarian border
On the Serbian border, the Hungarian police have deployed drilling gas and waterfalls against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has seen the violent breakdown at the border control point.
He told by telephone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
Behind it was formed a police line and behind the policemen was a water shutter ready.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw with stones, stoves and plastic bottles to the officials.
The officials initially put on an uninterrupted pepper spray.
The police then used drunk gas.
A lot of drinking gas was spread towards the refugees.
Thus the group was dissolved.
The refugees have now retreated somewhat.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the area.
The children who had breathed the drinking gas screamed.
Other refugees sacked together and lie under breath.
The Serbian police spokesman also suffered injuries due to the use of drinking gas and pepper spray.
Time of Decision on Interest Rates for the U.S. Bank
The world is observing the U.S. Bank’s meeting on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not the interest rates will be raised for the first time in a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half who had the opinion last week that the Fed would do this now thinks that the Fed will last a little longer and keep the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s seven years since the Fed set interest rates to Null.
“For the first time we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, Managing Director at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is at a relatively good performance level, billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less pink prospect of global relations.
It has warned the markets to set up on an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a step are good.
The decision will be announced at 20:00 MEZ on Thursday.
Death Guards at Delta State University Leave Apologies
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later killed and killed his colleagues on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "treating" at the first murder and wanted "he could do it wrong," the authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a professor of geography and social science education at the Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10:00 on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call center that the police should send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife yesterday night," and he also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house, but that "no one will bother" but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shootings.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, which said: "I'm so sorry, I wanted, I could make it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he eventually took his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn’t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “naturally there was something in Mr Lamb’s idea.”
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "trial relationship".
Princess was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married for about seven years, as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19, and she was "destroyed on the ground."
He said Prentiss was her daughter 'absolutely best friends'.
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had met Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, “He’s not going to prison.”
When police captured him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, flew by foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb was awarded a doctorate from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his life scientist says on the University’s website.
Stars Who Lost Their Happiness
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing partner, Farrah Fawcett, due to cancer.
The actor has also allegedly been fighting drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug ownership.
All this requires his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa to rebuild the group
Lufthansa is planning a large group building.
Half a billion euros a year, Lufthansa Group wants to save alone with a better organization.
150 of the world’s around 1,000 managers will cost the company’s workplace.
There are new negotiations with the Pilot Union.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its corporate structure and evaluating the low-cost Eurowings.
The objective of the renewal is a resulting contribution of approximately 500 million euros per year from cost and earnings synergies, the airline on Wednesday.
Lufthansa will no longer have a board for passenger business.
The cheap airline Eurowings should be developed as independent as possible.
In the board of directors of Chief Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings.
With the re-establishment, Spohr emphasizes the importance of Eurowings, with which the group will fight against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000 employees strong company was complex.
The airlines signed under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which accounts for three-quarters of the annual turnover of €30 billion.
Negotiations with the Pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations will be restarted after the judicial strike ceased on Thursday.
This was told by the trade union.
The topic of the talks is the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to get sustainable results as soon as possible "in a year with a predicted record result".
The conflict between the trade unions and the airline has led to various strikes over the past few months.
Background is in addition to the transitional supply of the pilots the savings concept "Wings".
It is predicted that Lufthansa, in the fight against competitors, will expand routes to the joint-owned Eurowings low-cost line.

Manchester United's Luke Shaw can't play for months due to double fraction
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this led the left outer defense to cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by an unmatched attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the playground and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, it's very hard and then playing fantastic, and then that's happening.
In the clothing cabin he had an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I’m not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won’t play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped from a red card and the eleven-meter hang.
Nicola Rizzoli, the judge, has not punished the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected the Italian judge had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself if I say that a eleven meter and a red card were required.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaws account was: "I thank you all for your news. words can't describe how broken I'm, my way to recovery begins now, I get back stronger."
Manchester United loses Luke Shaw in PSV defeat
The England defense has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, “It’s a very serious injury.”
If a player with this type of injury leaves the place, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent.
Moreno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing it very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear that it's a very bad injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was traveling in a different direction so it seemed as if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad.I am so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows the Lorax.
It's one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't take a long time until you know it almost outdoors.
Unless you may be David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite child book, the Prime Minister decided for The Lorax, the Environmental Fabel published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company’s website SuperCamps, and continues: “Light, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it’s a book that I like to read to my children because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we’ve missed so far.”
Everything beautiful and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the book's action, instead reflects a content description of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text.
"In the midst of the humiliated town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," it is read.
As if it wasn’t suspicious enough: Cameron’s text is partly read as the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins as follows: “In the humiliated town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams.”
Although he acknowledges to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the work of the book. Here an unnamed boy, like the local environment, is ruined by the money-giving, trees falling, thneed-stricking once-ler despite the protests of the named Lorax, a hurrying, scratched being, "who speaks in the name of the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to an assistant who has not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokesman said the text was probably from Cameron's electoral office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered to Cameron's staff, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from the English team, but it’s still hard
Fighting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the frame that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I would not exclude an outer victory.
Alastair Cooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting layout, and the community spirit is strong; they will not bear traps from 2012, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at the test level, it is an option for the attack.
According to the news, Adam Lyth is separated from the English test and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth, of course, is hard to analyze for me as his chief trainer in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no questioning signs at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination as - and I said this before - players are their own best voters.
Long ago, you would have extended Lyth's course, but he had control over his own fate.
If he hopes to bring out more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not perform so good, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test striker gets to put his sign is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and outdoors.
The only accusation that can be raised was that England first placed Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a striker that I appreciate very much.
He is a X-Factor cricket player that we saw at Yorkshire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which hit us very much.
He must have at least the same chances as he had before, but this, of course, depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to let Moeen beat next to Cook, which would bring an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I don’t see why a striker can’t beat there, and that leftist has already shown that he’s a devil square of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and didn’t look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the frame as a back-up spinner, and in my limited treatment with him he has impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - an average of 31 with the shooter and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no large number of backup spiners that raise their hands and the coaches have chosen for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England has made a few smart supplements in the trainer's stage.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a test game advisor could be a championship coup.
He is one of the nice guys in the game, who will bring a lot of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort to the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and as Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the clothing cabin can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with what was previously said.
Colly's team colleague at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not employed in the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I do not have a problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team makers don’t set the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made with easy heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = UK’s withdrawal from the EU) could win on entry if the economy falls into a flood by 2017
David Cameron’s unprecedented renewed negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will go deeper into difficulties with every day, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy “Is it Yes or No?” Corbyn to be the leader of Labour or the TUC, who breaks out for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend said recently that some Member States, so deeply ingested in various crises as the EU is now and not always for their own fault, are tired of the UK’s own agenda with divided concessions and disturbing treaty changes that they mostly don’t want.
At Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it didn’t like it even when it threatened social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It is always about me.
My European friend, who wishes a outside-looking UK inside the EU cell - "Don't let us alone with France," says Berlin - and let go through that more and more short-looking ministers and officials in some cities have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany’s carefully seized chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as it has happened with the excessive long-term expatriates such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16 years).
French President François Hollande is looking at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
It is also a disturbing force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It’s hard to imagine that they’re going to break one leg to help the selfie britain whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don’t want either because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some of these ministers may even plan intentionally not helpful comments, all in the SNP style, while the UK’s referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspect.
"The new negotiation was a crack" and "Great Britain won nothing of value from the new negotiation."
The Europeans know how robust the Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU skeptics are the press baron oligarchy, as they did not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can weakly remember Boris Johnson, the Erz-euro opportunist who made himself a name as a "EU-made bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-threatening scammers, telephone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-inlanders who own most of our big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought similarly about them, but noted that when you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you’re better distributing bananas to shed it, rather than going to his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum curve, because Blair had set the principle over the unapproved EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened him a back door.
The press has never forgiven him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly clap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he doesn't need time to waste for me anymore - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kinnock's 80-year-old Murdoch's boycott strategy, a mistake then and today.
It may take time, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position towards Europe is – I am kind to say – in development.
He says we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, the majority of people outside of Ukip’s traditional blue-colored trend and the wild wings of Tory’s small-Englandism can probably say yes to it.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week, when the pathfinder fought in him not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of provoking John McDonnell as a shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father tried on television to be unfair to his labor cabinet colleagues, without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary’s struggle was even more attractive.
But struggling to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his counterparts and MPs after all reports on her Monday night closing meeting.
Whatever the touching bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to transmit - remember that he has even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the hour and above all in the stream of social media, a brink of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s right to not give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to keep Labours’ support in the referendum campaign for an obvious, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins is sure that way.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental multi-difference about EU membership – in line with their Bennite invasion economy, their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for whom the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his multilaterals to NATO - Tom Watson is rocky convinced that JC does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense in everything for their bosses at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital – they also have suspicious voters – to make concessions to the British if all of this can be meaningless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost decrease by the Tory government at power, which I was reminded of when I launched on Monday of something that was called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England’s report on e-cigarettes
The claims of a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed to Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Principal Report" last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, some researchers have questioned the loadability of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A lead article in the medical magazine Lancet last month hit the "extraordinary windy foundation" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two more researchers wrote in BMJ and asked if the claims were "built on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness."
They said the public expects that PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” will be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were invited to develop a model for a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to bring their opinions about the harm of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managers were previously supposed to have received from the British American Tobacco Fund (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s public health references in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said to receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was supposed to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the group are not delivered, but it includes several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also indicate a industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco leadership of PHE.
The research work of the group “stains significantly” that there is a lack of “hard evidence for the damage of most products at most criteria,” wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, no of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “there’s no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers.”
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Wellbeing at PHE, said that BMJ’s claims had been responded before.
He said, “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
Every second lifetime smoker dies from his affection.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die annually from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the National Health System £2 billion per year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we meet our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former chief of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-right programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hardly controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broadcasts like BBC4.
After BBC’s CEO, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have trouble with the idea that the BBC orders or sends programs that would also clearly show unsubsidized rivals," Johnson told the Oberhaus Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcast fee, which I don’t consider a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least make its production on programs that others don’t do or order.
They send The Voice in a top-class time window because they want to as broad support as possible for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it’s ridiculous, it’s of course foolish.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax funds programs that could be funded even without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, acknowledged both of its own productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I try to see how this public-right television should be.
I don’t think that would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who managed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of hunting reviews "for the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC’s most popular broadcasts reflect what the former director of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC Shows should sell like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public-law niche programs should go to BBC4 where you can’t measure quite the audience, but they perform their tasks, and they can argue when they go to their seemingly holy missions to justify £4 billion broadcast fees, “Now, of course, we’ve created all these obscure programs that no one has seen.”
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
Johnson told the committee: “I ask you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from this.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a great value for £150 a year here, but for people who are a lot of money for £150, ask me if that’s true because they don’t consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission, "to inform, form and talk."
He said little of the BBC’s production would now officially be classified as education – he said that it’s 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on radio – and it should take an example on the public-law television stations in Australia and Canada to change this to “informing, revealing and entertaining”.
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Proms, of which he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and enter with the commercial broadcasters alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment they are radiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The small nematodes change the direction at the moment they are radiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by activating motoneuronic cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Researchers Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bluses.
The bluses, he found out, strengthen the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are associated, according to a Nature Communications report.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are strengthened by the microwaves and transferred to the worms where they turn on the altered motoneurons.
The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics, a roll-out tool that allows scientists to insert and turn off neurons with light impulses.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that needs to be sent on an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can happen to the tissue unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from the top on the neck.
"We believe that with gender therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Advertisements Shame Britain's Weapons Trade
Watch Amnesty International’s Anti-Arms Fair video.
The terrible murder drones.
Foot shrinking legs!
The bombs!
And electroshock stones that cause angry pain, but leave no trace!
The joyful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest weapons exhibition is a fighting parody produced by Amnesty International to raise the British government’s willingness to disguise weapons to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in Docklands, London.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible at bus stops and in the subway trains and that require a second look.
“High announcement: Do you drive with the DLR from 15 to 18 September?” (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the fonts of the London Underground and the brand marks of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a sharm of weapons dealers will run with the DLR ... customers are asked to help stop the weapons exhibition.
The 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped in the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of inbound keys, which is claimed to "access about one-third of the bus stop spaces on the planet."
Transport for London finds this poster-”vandalism” not funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Kurator of Crueol Designs and Professor at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists go to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go out into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the Anti-Arms Trade Places welcomes the pendlers in the subway.
The Amnesty’s video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works unprofitably with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works free of charge.
VCCP’s creative director Matt Lever was surprised by the silence that ruled around the advertising for the weapons fair – through an empty piece of the ExCeL calendar – and thought: “Let’s give them the campaign that they try to avoid.”
They played with the invention of a more realistic scary corporate advertising, but "through inflating with bright colors and animation it remains more responsible."
“They’ve done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair,” says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be treated illegally in front of our door.
Per the most creative art around the weapons exhibition comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors show fantastic euphemic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the U.S. Army on "the AT4CS RS removed from the shoulder."
This includes a “unicity-formed combat head that provides outstanding side effects inside the target.”

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Housing
Once years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student residence, still believing in advice and moral relativism, but only now I remember the stressed smiles of those I have angry – and the numerous, long-duty complaints about others.
Most of what I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entrance to student homes ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely scary.
It’s exciting to sweat: tell people where you’re coming from, if and where you’ve taken the Sabbath year, where you’re in relation to Corbyn and why you “ honestly don’t love or hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it’s just a HAHAHA extract, I’m in my room.”
Breathe through.
And help others do the same – ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, unlike those with whom you’t talk, even if your wings were thrown into fire and these were firefighters.
Let people.
People's rooms often turn into drink receptions, film-night events and municipal meeting points, but they're also the places where people dress and suit their underwear.
Related: Don't think of starting a relationship in the university
Introverted people receive a severe treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student houses form a space-to-space-bump culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone who tries to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I have spent on to interact with you."
Try to feel when a commillion is exhausted - and send him a SMS instead of climbing.
About climbing: Do it.
A guy in my student residence had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw a few things.
Friendship is closed by baking.
Since you start the university at the peak of the back-manie, climbing at the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the 1950s’ welcome “Welcome to the neighborhood, I’ve packed you something so, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions.”
Providing home-made dishes is a good way to close friendship.
Your fellow inhabitants feel committed to talking and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly mixed clumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when you clumps.
Theft of food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, crawling chicken is a robbery, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check it with the dairy owner.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves even when they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my companion who added a laundry to her milk to punish the thief.
She is now in prison.
You should not make noise that prevents people from sleep or work.
It’s not just about being a decent person, but that you belong, in the true sense of the word, to the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl on my corner asked her neighbors if it makes them something to put Drum & Bass a little quieter because it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded to it with even greater music.
When they finally stopped at 5 p.m., she gently left her neighbors to sleep for another two hours before she laid her own music crack, closed her door and went to her three-hour examination.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally enter the same student residence?
On the contrary, it’t be abstractly shameful if you consider a fellow resident for your future spouse, rushing to her, separating again and then having to see her every day and experience how she moves all the common friends to her?
Of course, the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot companion is definitely not your future spouse, try at least to bring a little reason to your subbody.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unclosed room, the boundary between a wolf and harassment is more fine than it seems.
A good strip is funny, but it takes only moments until it becomes a bumerang.
Give by hiding a valuable and fun lesson about safety – but never wash someone’s room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Close their doors, and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not deal with their possessions on the roof more than twice.
Regard houses for refugees, single-born, low-income
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in the middle-French Eckental row houses for people who don’t have much money.
So for example for refugees – but also as a sign: “Not only refugees need housing, but also the single-educating mother and the low-income.”
“I’m showing how to build well and affordably even today,” the 44-year-old said in an interview.
Thousands of refugees will be pushed into the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created: he builds in a project row houses for refugees.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will be pushed into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers or tournament halls has no sustainability.
Because the people remain here for a large part.
Given the flow of refugees, we need enough residential space in the next few decades.
A very banal, three-storey order house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs the least space.
This facilitates integration.
This is different when you put people in housing blocks.
Each of the six houses that are being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say that there is peace again, I’m going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living area per house is 184 000 euros, without property.
This is clear.
The construction took six months.
that is appropriate.
Did the construction regulations make their plans easier?
Gildner: In construction law, I have done my project correctly.
Particularly complicated it always makes the threatening Damokless Sword Special Building and the Placement Regulation.
and terrible.
It is still understood, whoever builds three apartments in a row house needs at least three seats.
There is only a lack of place in the cities.
Refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents react to their house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What definitely isn’t right.
But do you not strengthen the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: The truth is: in the last five years we had a building in Germany, but luxury apartments were built, which hardly one can afford.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single-educating mother or the low-income.
I will show you how to build well and well even today.
That is why it is.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem engineering in Regensburg and initially engaged in environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to Get the New iPhone Operating System When Apple Update Releases
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, pressing "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have met problems after the installation as they receive an error message that indicates that the "software update failed".
To overcome the problem, users are advised to either wait until the storm goes back or try to update through iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it unlikely by slowing up the update. Also, it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is completed.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charging device so that the battery is charged.
If the load is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may be half-blocked and this may lead to a breakdown of the update.
iOS 9 Release is still on schedule despite the WatchOS delay in reviewing iOS 9: the least exciting, but the best update of iOS 9: How to prepare for the new iPhone operating system
You should also make sure that you have checked our checklist of all things before you download to prevent things from going wrong and protect yourself if they do it. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's Single Device: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the struggle for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team colleague Lewis Hamilton only one motto: "Full Attack".
The second World Cup emphasized before the start in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose anymore."
53 points separate the vice world champion before the afternoon race in Singapore this Sunday from title defense and double champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the previous twelve season races and takes the Floodlight Grand Prize in the city state as a favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have an impact on the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear.
For a few days, a hole hangs over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The three months ago founded chess club "Chess Friends Bad Kissingen" has included another member in its rows, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who visited Bad Kissingen for healing more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is a carrier of the Federal Merit Cross of Class 1 and an honorary citizen of the cities Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has been supported by Gauselmann with a donation received against Chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to accept chess players who cannot make the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" will be seen as an expression of his connection with the Kurstadt.
Quarter office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Ancient Centre Antonistift have gathered under the mantle of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses.
The social foundation takes it down from the mountain to the center of the city.
More specifically at the Graf-Stauffenberg Square.
A new Quarter Office was recently opened.
Here, right next to the shopping market, from now on, seniors and consultants will receive information on questions such as health insurance or health insurance services.
For years, we have noticed with our ambulatory care service that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are infinite questions.
“It is also not unusual that many cash services are not taken into account, because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood,” explained the new housewife Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the citizen hospital as well as the ambulatory service “Amadeus”.
In addition to the consultations, the new Quarter Office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The greetings were brought to the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as crash prevention, memory training or a physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the Senior Center and the Saludis complement in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
“The Senior Center for Care and Care,” said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new Quarter Office in the centre of the city, both managers see especially in the demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
Furthermore, according to Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) at the inauguration celebrations, the Quarter Office also dedicates itself to the association in age: “There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social assembly.”
In this way, the Social Foundation made a great contribution that elderly people could live as independent and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The Quarter Office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 p.m., and Saturday from 10 to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg vs Würzburger Kickers on October 6
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the Würzburger Kickers was not yet fixed due to the renovation work at the Fuchspark Stadium, the date was set as October 6th.
The match of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bayerische Fußball Totopokal against the third-ligist FC Würzburger Kickers was finally terminated.
The game will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 19 p.m. at the Bamberger Fuchspark Stadium.
“We are happy that we now know when the game goes over the stage, now we have planning security,” said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the card pre-sales that is now launched.
It is a special thing for our team to play against a third ligist.
We therefore hope for a lot of spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special excitement.
In the round of the last 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg entered in 2010 by victories at the District League 1 FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the Regional League 1 FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives €5,000 and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Team Cup 2016/2017.
The title defence is the third-league SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna architect Karl Mang has died at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna Architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the Artist House on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Artist House loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the broadcast.
Born in 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture during and after World War II at the Technical College in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952, he has worked as a freelance architect, but he has also worked as a teacher, writer and institute manager.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute for Forming.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treasure Chamber in Wiener Hofburg and the rebuilding of the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Tim Wiese gets a police officer with money
Former footballer Tim Wiese has been uncovered in Bremen.
Footballer was once, now Tim Wiese, former national torchist in Germany and engaged in Bremen and Hoffenheim, is Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass he has claimed to have passed over the past two years.
Intellectually he did not respond.
Wiese was just cutting his hair in the centre of Bremer when he saw outward a parking room guard showing a penalty card for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then dropped out of the business, offended the officer and threw her the penalty before her feet, as the "Bild" newspaper reports.
In the city of Bremen, the accusations are confirmed, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
“The matter is still in examination,” says the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether or not it will be displayed.
Panama authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the typical rainforest climate of Isla del Rey are best suited for the cultivation of marijuana plants.
For three days, Panama authorities have destroyed and burned the 4,500 plants.
A 17-Year-Old Afghan Man
Witnesses are searched by the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 23:45, three young men were walking from Bad Soden toward Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, according to the police, followed his two friends in a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft point.
There were also three people on the ground of the gas station.
One of these men then shouted to the young man and hit him in the face with the faust.
The victim suffered a nasal injury and bleed strongly from the nose.
When his two friends came to the battle and flattered the striker, he first left his victim.
His friends brought the wounded young man home.
The murderer traced the group with a car to their apartment and walked there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
He was attacked by the shooter and another man.
Under the help of a strike, the victim’s face and spots were scattered.
The injured was brought to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the murderer.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second shooter was about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
Police ask witnesses and indicators to sign up at the telephone number 06181/100-123
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Practice Felstehausen and invests €310,000
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
This is also a pleasure for summit mayor Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and mayor Heinfried Kabbert of Asendorf.
In many places in the country, doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the contrary, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retired, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still with a half place on his successor in the coming months.
After a rebuilding phase, Müller will reopen the practice on 12 October, until then he will invest €310,000 in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when the railway houses met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who are currently completing their professional training at Verdener Hospital and will also go into practice next year.
“We’ve always thought that the rubber would fit well in this practice,” says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
“When it was so, I just called you.”
The married couple Müller liked the idea to operate their own practice in the future in Asendorf.
“The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us,” says the 39-year-old Müller.
“We want to know and accompany the families over the years.”
As a benefit he also sees to be his own boss soon.
And so it was agreed, the dirters bought the house with the practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
The two-year-old father of the family, Frank Müller, also grew up there, his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practises as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
Currently he works as a general doctor in Sulingen, in 2009 he was appointed as the chief medical doctor in the district of Diepholz and is voluntarily engaged in the DRK preparation Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From September 19 the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a home doctor, his wife Ursel (interist) has specialized in gastroenterology.
The smellers, both internists, want to settle themselves as home doctors.
“So endoscopy comes out,” says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound surveys as well as long-term and load ECGs and need a speech room more.
The computer is completely renewed.
A subsidy of a total of €50,000 will be granted to the wasteholders within the framework of a subsidy program from the countryside (€25,000) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (€12,500) and the municipality (€12,500).
“This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued,” says Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, approximately 2,000 patients come to the practice of Felstehausen every quarter, in the North German average practice it is about 500.
There is another home doctor’s practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of practice adoption by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains, according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone.
Whoever visits Müller's speech, on the other hand, continues to look especially in familiar faces: he takes over the seven medical staff and the cleaning power from the roads.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have been practising there for 30 years.
“At the beginning we had only two rooms,” Ursel Felstehausen remembers.
You feel a bit of anger after a long time.
“But we’re still living in Hohenmoor and we’ll surely see many patients often,” the internist says.
Her man adds laughing: "We have a 6000 square meters ground."
So far I’ve always pushed myself before gardening, now it could be different.”
The couple also have two grandchildren and enjoy traveling.
Croatia: “We leave the refugees”
“Now the border controls will rise also at our southern border,” Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
The controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for an asylum can do this “self-consciously”.
Safety and safety of people are at the forefront.
But it’s also clear that it needs clear signals,” the minister said.
People must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, even over the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It requires a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia refuses
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also intends to allow arriving refugees to travel further toward Austria and Germany and may also build corridors for the refugees.
This was not the case with the Minister of the Interior Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of the corridors is "absolutely unacceptable" and Slovenia will rather intensify the border surveillance - especially to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, however, is already strongly controlled as the outside border of the Schengen area.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Slovenia does not want to shut its borders for refugees.
“Every member of the EU must fulfill its obligations, otherwise the system can’t work,” Györkös Znidar said.
As the Croatian government, the first refugees had already tried to enter Eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in the night hours of Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were captured in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles and new refugees have been constantly intercepted in Tovarnik, Croatia.
They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation.
In the coming days, its country is expected to have about 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Moreover, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected to Croatia, the Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday agreeing.
The government in Belgrade, however, denies that it is to instruct people to push certain routes: “We can’t, nor want we to do this,” it said.
According to the media reports, at least in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid, and in the course of the day more buses would be expected.
Through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inhabitants had been traveling through Serbia throughout the night from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometers away.
“We’ve heard that Hungary has done it, so the police told us we should go here,” one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
Thus, it could actually be the move of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Madonna-Serbia-Hungary, which was already predicted by observers, to a slightly further western route.
Croatia: ‘Comprehensive possibilities for border control’
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had previously emphasized that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible emergencies in the event of a strong flow of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "comprehensive possibilities for border control."
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen Area.
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007, and since then, the EU partners have made a good testimony to the country regarding the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, around 300 refugees are still detained behind the Hungarian border.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the last night on the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two borders of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to move to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Minister of the Interior, Nebojsa Stefanovic, tried to calm on Wednesday morning at a local check-in in Horgos: he says the debates on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is closed, are too early.
This is not a very high number of refugees.
It is not yet possible to say whether they will continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Assistants Rate Migrants to - Dangerous - Alternative Routes
However, private Hungarian refugee assistants have already begun to distribute land cards to the refugees on which alternative routes are recorded through Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still unclean mining fields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mining rooms was sent to the border region.
Stock Exchange Hacker: Ukrainians Pay $30 Million
Supranonok has heard of a ring of cybercriminals accused of getting insight into unpublished financial reports and press reports on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
With the information obtained, Insider transactions were made on the financial markets.
In this way, the investigators say more than $100 million were raised.
“Today’s comparison shows that even those outside our country’s borders will eventually be captured,” it says in the SEC statement.
The trial against 32 other accused persons in the case continued.
Most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The murderers are alleged to have acted in both the United States and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospizhilfe Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz is governed by reger operations.
People do their worries, partially fast steps, partially comfortably bumping.
They control the two stations of the Mannheimer Motor Show at the parade square.
The city railways.
Pulseous, brilliant life with a magnificent autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large tables each with the title "Before I die I want to die"....
The Ecumenical Hospizhilfe made attention to its 20th year of existence with this action and looks quite confronted with mixed reactions.
“It’s going to die, so we’ve gone to the city and among the people with the action,” says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospizhilfe is available to passengers for questions and conversations as well as the volunteer staff.
While some passants spontaneously catch the creed and add the phrase about “behavior my life”, “can read”, “drive with the camper through the United States”, “stop the war” or “not suffer long”, others stay short, read, say the phrase like “so far I’m not yet” and then go on.
On the edge, small discussions about action on itself, about life, about dealing with death are continuously developing.
Peter Hübinger is also on the spot.
“Only if I realize that the end of this world will come to me at some point, I will be able to live responsibly,” says Manheim, director of the Diakonic Works, who, together with the Caritas Association, is the carrier of the Ecumenic Hospizhilfe.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20-year-old.
That not everyone wants to publish on the tables, however, is understandable, in the end it is a very personal thing.
The subject of death and death is still to be argued with tabus, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospital movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the people’s opening.
A rating that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and sad companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Through personal experience faced with the topic, she read a lot of literature and decided to want to engage in death aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospizhilfe called for volunteer, it immediately registered and was present at the establishment in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers – 43 women and two men – who accompany the victims and their relatives in private households, hospitals, nurses and in the San Vincent Hospital.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences done.
"I see life from another expectation, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulatory ecumenical hospital service is free and confession-independent.
The financial support of the health funds and donations from family members and associations enables the training as well as the continuation of training and supervision of the death and sad companions.
Every two years, training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
More personal wishes can also be recorded on postal cards.
FedEx Results Mixed, Financial Prospects Reduced for 2016
FedEx disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supplier giant reduced its profit outlook to a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the vacation.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company intends to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the vacation time.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in Premarket trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year that ends in May next, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected, according to a survey by FactSet, $10.84.
The lower prospect comes despite the price rise, which is an average of 4.9 percent and will become effective on 4 January, and despite higher additions for ground transport of heavy and large packages, which will be raised from November.
The company said it still expects that the outcome will increase compared to the previous year due to cost decrease, higher revenue and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid revenue if we consider the weaker as expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The vacation employment plans were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS, which plans to set off 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than the previous year.
The profit per share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, the twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Revenue increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks surveyed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping over the past few years, which has led to the turnover in its Express shipping unit to stagnation.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport sales increased by 29 percent, but the operational outcome was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-assurance.
The Express unit higher revenue due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the cargo business.
In Premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fall by $3.85 or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting this year, Federal Reserve Strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the leads for the first time in almost a decade.
Through them at the end of the decorated, two-storey meeting hall is a wall picture of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.
The Central Bank has a double order from Congress: Maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to start to get rid of the unprecedented incentive by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most economic data show that it is growing solid, the recent turbulence in the global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives worried about increasing this volatility by raising interest rates for federal bonds - and even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they observe,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the broker company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a prejudice not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself makes the financial market uncertain.
Approximately half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg have predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator that shows only a 30% chance of a rise.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate unless the strategists relieve the blow by promising that another rise is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average rose by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed’s policy will maintain the ratio this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the rates at that time,” he said.
If she does it, "she should go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don't get in panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Even a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on a good way to raise the rate by 0.25 percent points this month, the first small step in a slow aggravation of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that this year, despite the complaints of the liberals that more economic progress would be required, she expected an increase in the rate.
Although the creation of jobs slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level that the Fed considers full-time.
Salary increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation continued to go below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can deal with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world collapsed at the end of last month after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell more than 16 percent below its high in May, when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would drive global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, with the Dow now almost 10 percent below the high in May.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulences affect the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would pull the currents in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Nottingham Bank.
Now he predicts that he will wait at least a month to get the effects better in control.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts will be on the U.S. economy, and there's almost no reliable data that describes the developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank has been huge in recent years.
The merely indication by the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013, that the Fed could “small” its monetary expansion, triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, the Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for asset management of the company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that “the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that are apparently not related to the economic fundamental data.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is committed to an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in the years 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its leading interest rates by 0.75 percent points in three sessions " despite limited noticeable impacts on growth in the US", Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives rejected these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate committee.
The recent turbulences don’t come close to this level, he said.
"She doesn't want to get into a situation where she's afraid of a interest rate rise because the markets are exciting," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until this is changed, I don’t think it should predict the time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
by Chinatown
The market/the warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.

There is even a car department if you need motor oil.
The store is enormous, and it takes over an hour to slide through the passages.
If the whole shopping store makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and cheap) in this store is located close to the box and has various pick-up options.
What is there here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
The LAX-C is likely.

Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To prepare you a warm welcome does not go without the involvement of countless volunteers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a whole number of people who support unprofitable asylum seekers in the city.
These include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She also likes to teach with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she takes it at the Asylum Appeal House on Dillinger Street.
It helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn German.
Of course, this is a different lesson than in a right school.
Brazil's Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS tries to shocking women about how important good nutrition is during breastfeeding. it does this with the presentation of images of babies who sweat on the chest painted with representations of unhealthy foods.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers will be advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research findings suggest that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, the unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The Bernried Municipality approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flat for solar installations.
The plannings for the long-awaited tournament building at Bernrieder Sportgelände come step by step: In the last municipal council session, the prepared construction proposal was unanimously blessed without large discussions.
Previously, the body had, among other things, decided a request for a construction law "exception" or "liberation" from the current construction plan.
The "exception" was about the permit for a special form in relation to the roof construction.
Therefore, a "satteldach with non-mediate first and roof overstand" will be built.
The background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "Through this we get a wonderfully large south roof together," Mayor Josef Steigenberger said at the meeting.
The "liberation" was, again, about the roofness, which for energy reasons - unlike the building plan prescribed - should be below 10 degrees.
The volume of the hall is significantly reduced.
A "liberation" was therefore needed because the construction plan does not allow "exceptions" in relation to the dishonestation - whereas the Bernrieder municipality council is usually more restrictive in the case of exemption applications.
However, the turnhall construction is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedence," Steigenberger said.
The tournament building at the Sportzentrum is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
The cost is estimated at approximately 2.3 million euros.
Subsidies are expected from the school and broad sports promotion.
In the next step of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters hall will now be submitted to the council office for examination.
Peißenberg Clinic to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital is expected to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the staff move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is shown by the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the Landkreis, which Landrätin Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
A decision will be made by the Supervisory Council, and it will meet on Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were implemented, all of the 50 employees in the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to work.
The overwhelming majority should move to Schongau with fishermen and the still existing internal station.
The rooms are present.
To employees who cannot get to Schongau, a job will be offered in Weilheim, Jochner-Weiß said.
The staff are informed about the plans.
The change has led to the resignation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice near the hospital.
When asked who to play the successor, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into the game, who declared willing to take over the leadership from 1 October and switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this in any case meant a "revaluation" and a spread of the offer in the field of "Inner Medicine", according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in heartbeat makers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases at the internal station.
As a transition for the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Council approves, will lead both houses, until then next year the former Knapschaft hospital, which still has over 35 beds, will be finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the current rehabilitation at Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Landrätin Jochner-Weiß, who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Council, faced rumors that the house, which is in possession of the federal power, will be used in the future as a residence for asylum persons.
As it goes on with the property, Jochner-Weiß could not say there are several considerations.
Currently there is a short-term caritas care and a day psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity doesn't come again," said Fischer about the quasi move to the leech, which was "positive and very understandable" by the staff.
A real perspective for the house in which the fisherman has worked as a chief physician for over 30 years has not existed.
He was asked by Schongauer's colleagues to take over the post of medical director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (formerly 100 beds) has been repeatedly threatened by closure over the past decades, departments have been closed, for example, surgery and birth care.
The handballers of the Rhein-Neckar Löwen are requested tonight at the Bergische HC.
The table leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for overwhelming.
In the last season, the bathers had a painful defeat at the BHC and had something to do there.
Hunting accident with two injured in Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by a shot on Tuesday afternoon.
During the abrasion on a corn field near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg) several hunters were in operation, the police.
After a shooting, a 63-year-old and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident occurred was unclear at first.
The criminal police investigate.
16-year-old from Rheinland-Pfalz missing victim of violent crimes
A suspect has been brought to the body of a 16-year-old man from Rheinland-Pfalz who has been missing since Saturday.
During the interrogation, the 20-year-old acknowledged that he had killed the young people and thrown their bodies into a channel in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rheinland-Pfalz, who has been missing since Saturday, has been a victim of a violent crime.
The young woman's body was found on Tuesday night in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, the prosecutor's office and police on Wednesday.
The suspect is a 20-year-old who was also arrested on Tuesday night, who stated the offence according to the statement and led the investigators to the place where the body was found.
The 16-year-old was missing on Sunday after she had not come home as agreed after a visit to an autumn party in Rockenhausen in the morning.
In search of the young woman, the investigators first encountered the victim’s personal items.
During interrogations in the friend and acquaintance circle of the missing, a suspect was eventually found against the 20-year-old.
The suspected murderer then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the police, the prisoner confessed that he had killed the 16-year-old and placed the body in the channel.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the prosecutor on Wednesday, the investigators put him to death.
Further investigation of the circumstances of the incident will bring to further investigations.
Refugees Need Accommodation: Study Warns of Apartment Failure
The situation on the German housing market is stressful.
More and more refugees are also looking for a affordable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is faced with a challenge.
The distribution struggle on the German housing market has long begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing to a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units should be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study on behalf of the Alliance "Social Housing Building".
For comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
140,000 houses are missing.
After the first three months of their residence, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a primary accommodation.
Many then encounter the housing market and rise into the long serpents before the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Bureau of Statistics, less than half of all asylum seekers lived on rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also shows significant failures in the housing policy in recent years.
Germany is facing a housing deficit that is increasing from year to year.
Currently, about 770,000 housing units have been missing in the settlement areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many workers therefore dwell in large cities in WG rooms.
Young adults unvoluntly stayed longer in the "Hotel Mama" due to the flood on the housing market.
In major cities, the number of square meters per capita has dropped again for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing Building" proposes a re-start.
Therefore, new incentives are to rebuild social housing.
Thus, the basic business tax could be withdrawn and the basic tax for sponsored houses could be suspended for a time.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax deduction options are needed.
The State Bank KfW’s refugee accommodation funding program is already working well with cities and municipalities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the available around 300 million euros were recalled on Monday night with €184 million.
The project could even be pushed up.
Refugees are free to move: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridors
After Hungary is practically no longer passing, as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia.
Zagreb has announced that it will allow the passage through Slovenia to the north without any obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to negotiate with its neighboring Slovenia on the establishment of a refugee corridor.
"I talked to the Slovene Interior Minister, and if necessary we will organize a corridor," the Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
Croatia is not a Schengen country.
After the dismantling of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have fled to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people have arrived across the border near Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television channel RTL.
Hungary had shut down its border for refugees.
New laws, which entered into force on the same day, make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary.
Croatia wants refugees to pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who live and want to something.
But there were people who didn’t want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had reached the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighborhood of Croatia.
The majority of the media reports are from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They arrived both by bus and tax to the Serbian border city of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they had tried to reach Croatia by foot over the green border.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not encounter border zones.
For this, the border stripes have other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mines will quickly create a safe passage.
After the closure of the border, there are no more refugees coming to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people.
Shortly before the departure on Monday, there were 9380.
The new Hungarian law implies overcoming and damaging the border area as a crime.
35 criminal proceedings have been initiated in the southern Hungarian border city of Szeged.
The prisoners are threatened to a prison sentence of up to five years and the expulsion from the country.
According to the Immigration Authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of which - 93 - the most important transition Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning there were 40 refugees.
But practically no one has an opportunity to get asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a “safe third country.”
The refused asylum seekers will be dispatched.
Before the “transit zone” in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszk, the workers began to get rid of it.
They gathered the waste that tens of thousands of people had left on the streets over the past few weeks.
Closers were destroyed and one of the reception camps in the border site was rebuilt.
No one wanted to speak about the purpose of this reconstruction.
Austria reaches only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants remained in the country, according to government reports.
In Salzburg, about 1,400 people are waiting to travel to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on instructions of the German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot.
Mayor Crossing ‘Gestrandete’ Over the Border
“We were busy cleaning after the bridge party on Sunday, when suddenly ten people with travel bags stood at the entrance of the hall,” Wernstein’s mayor Alois Stadler said.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
Because Germany, however, surprisingly stopped the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the refugee stream, it was an end for them in Wernstein,” said Stadler, who immediately invited his help and carried the Gestrandete along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to near Passau.
Before we had the unexpected guests for the first time, with Jause and drinks.
We just said we'd take them with the car to Passau.
“It was obvious for us,” Stadler said in the OÖN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man did not afford to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire.
“We’ve been very pleased,” said Stadler.
The trained train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train to Passau on Sunday night in Wels to try over the border after the short-term announcement that the train traffic to Germany was stopped.
The regional train was stopped in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in course.
The Brückenfest connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday, the day before a double-brücken race sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending thousands more to us is a logical result of a seemingly holy policy:
Instead of helping in the camp Röszke immediately in the creation of structures that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has high-efficient and publicly brought the position of the Hungarian government into the Dunst Circle of National Socialism.
Not only are the Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to realize that the “loved country” they have invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, in light of the continuing flows of refugees and the coming winter, to create humanitarian conditions for seekers of protection.
And it will be one even greater – to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad is looking for 35,000 winter festival quarters
Konrad has all the hands to do with the refugees.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word has weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen bankers to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first reception center of Traiskirchen has already got Konrad in control.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he about his first success.
Also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had arrived in Austria on Monday was done without a big turmoil, Konrad said and praised the organizational "master performance".
The Ministry of Internal Affairs, on the other hand, stated a “crisis situation.”
In total, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarters this year.
To meet the number, there will still be 35,000 accommodations to be found in the coming weeks – 20,000 will be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federation.
If there are more refugees, we can do so.
“But it’s not a façade without soil,” Konrad said.
He has already talked with the council leaders.
These would have guaranteed him to create quarters for the coming refugees.
“It’s going well in Upper Austria,” Ferry Maier said.
The former VP Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also put great expectations in the ORF action “Help Like Us”.
On the platform, individuals can offer easy accommodation.
There are hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
During emergency times, it may not be that the Quarter Cabriolet must maintain a certain height of the handheld holders or the size of the surface lights.
For a period of time, “Notstandards” should apply.
That he, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, is more successful in accommodation, Konrad justifies with his experience.
I am an elderly Lord, to whom the untruth is not constantly told in the face.
Confidence is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause any costs to the Republic, as they themselves stated.
The number of employees will be increased to three to four.
Our own quarter search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container on the Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
Currently no opening of city sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for Refugees is planned by the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, as the affected people can be accommodated without these measures, mayor Klaus Luger (SP) says.
For emergency cases, other locations will be checked for their validity.
The head of the city criticises the division of refugees within the federal country.
Other districts also have to contribute.
Seehofer: “The boundaries will not be shrinked”
In a longer telephone conversation with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Prime Minister Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday announced the next step in the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be depleted.
The continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
There will no longer be special trains with refugees to Germany.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Pühringer once again urged the other EU member states to strengthen solidarity on the issue of refugees.
The fact that Austria is now re-introducing controls on its borders is for Pühringer a “logical consequence” of the German action.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New Wire" in the Linzer Industry Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the stock marketed IT group S&T is built, the rest (2700 square meters) is intended to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
“In IT, the smart heads are our raw material – and we have to try that they work for us,” says S&T chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in the start-up firms of the New Wire and later acquiring those.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors – which Niederhauser promises a lot: “The next Runtastic is just a matter of time.”
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which accounts for one-third of the city of Linz, the Land of Upper Austria and the Bund (FFG).
The building has been packed by Linz AG for 60 years with S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining area in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni owner opens second store in Arkade
In the new store, Furla handbags are at the heart.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
This project had to be postponed by the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt-Arkade: in the end, she has now gained growth in the form of another business site.
In the Furla shop in front of the store, in which it sells pockets, suitcases, shoes and clothes from different manufacturers, now everything turns around women’s handbags of the brand Furla, wallets are from 75 euros to have.
Larger pockets and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
It was rebuilt several weeks before.
“I’ve been thinking for a long time if I’m going to open a store,” says Breit.
It was important for the decision, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were engaged with the idea of their own location where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only in the larger area of Linz that sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has gotten widespread from her mother in the wing.
It’s best for me when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some women are so disappointed when they see a beautiful handbag, even the specialist cannot answer with last certainty.
Per it’s because a beautiful pocket repairs every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Callstadt
The pastoral ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called Angeber.
This attitude connects some with the billionaire who wants to become U.S. President.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for exciting people.
Whether he is alien-hostly, speaks to journalists or reveals lack of knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential office strongly pushes up the election campaign.
Cut it well.
This is also recorded in the Pfalzic Cold City, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the Föhnfrisur is a term for many in the Wine Village on the Wine Street.
Some in the 1200 inhabitants place is more than -six corners related to him.
His grandfather came from Cold Town in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the election mode.
The Cold Town Lady Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about their goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
“I think they find it somewhat exciting, but they’re not so deeply impressed in their cold city style,” says Simone Wendel.
The born Cold Town woman has drawn a fun documentary about the site and its famous displays, among which, in addition to Trump, the ketchup family Heinz also includes.
Trump, who is not known for humility, also comes to the word in "Kings of Cold City" (2014) - so with the statement that he would be successful if he would live in Cold City.
He did not bring it to the king of hearts.
Although there is respect for the family’s performance, it also tends to think that Trump is “a little big mould,” Wendel says.
Accidentally, the top name, the Cold Town has in the surrounding area, "The Brulljesmacher" - to High German: the Angeber, she says.
Trump comes from the village of the Angeber.
Trump’s success story began in 1885, when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold cave in the United States.
The foundation of the real estate group were the first real estate purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed in the Bavarian state to which the Pfalz belonged at the time.
He did not accept Trump because he was once withdrawn without permission, the director of the Pfalzic History and People's Science Institute, Roland Paul, had announced the film's start.
Trump is the grandson of an illegal immigrant.
This is contrary to the sometimes markable statements of the descendant.
He has repeatedly flirted about Mexican immigrants to the U.S. and called for the construction of a border wall to scare illegal immigrants.
"As the polter, it's not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a remote relatives of Trump ("The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandmother was a born Heinz").
The retired winer sees the Americans more distant, “he’s always so exhausting.”
Do you think Trump will come?
“I can’t imagine it,” the 72-year-old says.
“He has never taken care of Cold City.”
The pensionist Veronika Schramm mentioned, like some Callstadters, that a descendant of the Heinz family gave something for the church orgles during a visit, which was generally good.
“I can’t imagine this about Donald,” the 68-year-old says.
They find it better if he doesn’t win the election because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good.”
If those who had said that at the time of his grandfather in the U.S. were like him, "he would never come there."
“There are more interesting topics than him,” says winer’s daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
“My president is not,” she says.
“The grapes will be mature even without President Trump.”
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 filmmakers, even in the U.S. awakening interest.
The Oberbayer Municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is the first "Bergsteigerdorf" in Germany.
From the hand of the Vice-President of the German Alps Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800 inhabitants village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received on Wednesday the award for gentle tourism.
There are already 20 “Mountainous Villages” in Austria.
In the neighboring country, the Alps Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "Mountainous Village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be declared as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson are rushing to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it has not made major shifts in the reviews for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull created the fall of Tony Abbott.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a weekly series of international television broadcasts including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to have no importance for Australian TV viewers as Sunrise achieved an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight rise compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers to 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament!
Karl and Lisa are okay, thank you for the review!

The great news for Seven was the impressive 800 words debut with former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently disappointed father who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics were wondering if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday’s evening answered this with a clear “yes”.
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and slightly hit The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results at night two by The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe received an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot-Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half of the hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half of the hour set 720,000.
Hot-Seat is an average of 620,000.
The decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will Nine assured that Hot-Seat will end up at 17:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a Million Dollar Minute that failed to overflow the McGuires Show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
A secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknownly revealed who will win The Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood eventually landed in The Bachelor was hidden in the greatest secret.
And none of the three remaining girls will disclose whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons' Fellows on the day before becoming three two, you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday.
All three women have lyrically dismissed why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as the reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should get Woods' last rose?", their answers could become the game dealer who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly - except for themselves - named Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day.
“Since I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sams energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought about it throughout the show,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah stands on earth with both legs, it's so fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I have seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be good as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood could be "the one."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this obviously is not just a game - I'm now unreserved to him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not she, then she was mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a disagreement between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 19:30, on Ten.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day last year's end.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches had banned Hayne for the rest of the game when he lost a gerangel as the Aussie-Rugby-Liga Convertit did at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next chance to a Punt return and also into the ongoing game after a injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the clothing cabin after the game.
Instead of melting his rookies through the mole before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advises him to forget his broken catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patches at a point that was restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first game district
It was not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the playground after the fumble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1, that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career.
“It was a thing that happens now, you’re just taking care of the next game, and that’s what it’s,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the cutter with his origin debut in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans while holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested on a Siberian rolling field with weapons.
After he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was captured, and his democratic efforts were interrupted.
Due to the high number of refugees, the free voters are calling for the arrest of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria.
Party and party chief Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW Autumn Closure in Großwallstadt against a serious crisis in Bavarian schools when there are no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse," Aiwanger said.
"And otherwise we will get disruptions in the Bavarian education system."
The Parliamentary Party of the Free Electors will meet until Friday in the sub-French Municipality.
In fact, different main topics were proposed.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free Electoral Meeting.
“Naturally, the issue of asylum will overlap the clause,” Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it was during the Yugoslav War in the 1990s.
“So it doesn’t go further, we have to find out the causes,” said the Free Electoral Chief.
Refused asylum seekers want to dismiss free voters as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum lawsuits: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.
The head of the FW criticized that several federal countries were not consistent: "We needed uniform standards of the federal countries throughout the federal country."
“Bayern stops, others don’t.”
“We need to be more effective.”
However, the country’s policy in Grand Wall City should not fall under the table.
A long-lasting burner remains on the agenda: the education policy.
For the new school year, the Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) launched the pilot experiment "Middle Level Plus" at 47 high schools, testing an extension of the high school middle level from three to four years - as a result it takes nine years again until graduation.
However, Aiwanger is not far enough.
“The G9 issue needs to be accelerated,” the FW chief said.
We call for freedom of choice for all the high schools who want it.
Free driving at the G9 wherever desired.

Four people killed after police shoot rubber shots on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot a rubber shot into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, a official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday night in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Chief District Officer, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used drunk gas and then shot into the air before they dropped on a rubber shot.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber shots, which are known to be capable of killing, but which are traditionally used as less fatal alternatives, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in the southern levels of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want a own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent confrontations since the 10th.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial topic in Nepal, which has been governed centrally for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Planned construction in the city
The property at the Emder Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters.
A mixture of trade, business and housing is planned, but concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a property of about 4,000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Youth Centre Alte Post.
Preparations for this are ongoing.
It is planned to use the ground for a mixture of trade, business and housing.
We are looking forward to the proposals, it is said by the city.
Which investor will be questioned is not yet clear.
Therefore, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had bought a part of the land, which is located on the Ringstraße / corner of the Great Street, already a few months ago and let the building on it break down.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement on the Little Sea near Emden take shape.
The investor for the first time presented public plans for the project.
Some investors are still worried - they are afraid of selling their leisure refuge
For months, behind closed doors was negotiated, grown, debated and painted.
Now the plans for a new holiday home on the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday night at the Emder Council City Development Committee.
Initially, this point was on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP group, who warned the investor and the administration of secret cremery, Ralf Behrends from the system-building management went into the offensive: "We have not yet an answer to all questions," he said to the board members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The cost of about 10 to 12 million euros has been discussed for months.
Strong reactions among the seafood owners who had come to the meeting raised the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, the seafood owner and board member at the interest representation of the investors, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant cloth that overtakes all the other buildings."
He also fears, like many other project critics, that the traffic would greatly increase due to the planned size of the facility: "There must be all bus loads, so that is expected," Schulz said.
What is exactly happening on the well one hectare area of the former hostel, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
“First we have to have a clear concept,” said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans are still variable.
Twin Birds at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurter Zoo is pleased with the youth at its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins.
Twin births are rare in Gorilla.
The latter in a German Zoo is almost 50 years ago and was in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the Zoo.
The gender of the newborn Gorilla Twins is not yet fixed, as Mother Dian so far keeps them closely on the body.
The first “image” was.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of the Cape Islands
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday a broad deep pressure system approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical turmoil in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined deep pressure system, in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, also has a 60-percent potential to form a tropical turmoil in the next two days, the weather experts stationed in Miami added.
Google starts double donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a double donation campaign aimed at investing $11 million in humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overturned the European nations as they flee from the war-destroyed and poor countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach when announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of allowing a manager to make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
“Our journey included many dark rail and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migration crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first global gathered donations up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya that were destroyed by the war.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It’s still too early to say if slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-chirurgical treatments.
“The mortality data takes a long time to show something,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote a lead article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to take food.
Over the years, obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have been shown to be effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are sick obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain degree of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used the data they have collected since 2007 in a study and compared two types of obesity surgery – stomach bypass and gastrointestinal formation – to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who submitted this operation fell from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained approximately the same in those who received non-chirurgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those undergoing a surgical intervention, the disease was completely resolved at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes was completely solved at only one percent and partially at only about two percent.
In addition, the results in blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol controls were “generally better in the ‘chirurgical’ group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient’s blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as you reflect in improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues said.
The research team also compared average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass Surgery Group had lost more weight compared to the Gastrectomy Group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater declines in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 % vs. 2.1 %) and a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9 % vs. 16.7 %).
While the new study does not show survival benefits of surgery after five years, there are evidence from a study of more severe people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any benefit for survival in surgical patients, Blackstone said it was calming for people with a BMI below 35, who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower," without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long until we get people to take it seriously,” she said.
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have strongly linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes, a conversion is really difficult.”
Love Story Playing in the Hunsrück
It’s a topic that is now getting more attention in Belletristik: a young woman, unpleasant and unlike at school times, met after years the darkness of her youth again, and this falls in love with her.
This is the story of Luisa Binder’s novel “We’re Not So” by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel may be interesting especially for Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author has grown up in Langweiler and is pleased that she could place a literary monument in her home.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
“Europe can’t accept all the refugees,” the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies.
He demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, but the situation is not appropriate.
“It’s impossible that everyone can come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria’s efforts to tackle the crisis, he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution.
“To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, how real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries,” he said.
Finally, we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
“The use of violence has never solved these problems,” he added.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of violence and also commented George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attack and found that the U.S. violent reaction traced a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he set up violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in use of hand-de-infectants by children over the past 4 years
Toxic control centers in the U.S. report a 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who sweat strongly alcoholic hand-desinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of hand-desinfections in children under 12 years of age, the poison control centers report, increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children come more and more frequently to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a proof of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinfectants just because of a cheap experience.
Adolescents have allegedly mixed desinfectants with alcoholic oral water to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive odors of the desinfectant.
"A child doesn't think that's bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand desinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are desinfectants with peanut butter, vineyard and orange juice, which are very attractive for children.
Hand infectious drugs contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, very few sprayers can lead to alcohol poisoning.
“It’s highly concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency center at the University Hospital of Kansas, told Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you would not let a drink of whisky stand around, but people leave this hand-desinfectant within the reach of children, and when children come to it, then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four sprinks from a hand-de-infectant in the school, was taken to emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk in an adult, Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta, said.
Nhaijah laughed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency.
Doctors watched them overnight in a separate children's hospital on signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
“It was very scary,” said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and to store hand-infectants outside the reach of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some desinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario women after swallowing hand-de-infections that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Staff of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class students in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by exposing antibacterial products around the classroom," a police report said.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand-de-infection drugs and banned her from her room.
Police regarded the dismissed plan as a "shake" and refer disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In an accident on the crossroads between Nordring and On Herdenen, a 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in an accident.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossroads towards Circuit Transport Industry Area and noticed too late that two advance vehicles had stopped on Circuit Transport.
After that, he pulled his truck into the heck of an Audis and threw that vehicle on a Ford Fiesta on the front.
The vehicles involved in the accident caused damage of approximately €10,000, the police.
The 33-year-old’s Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be removed.
No harmony at Celtic
Griffiths is playing the speech of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila acknowledges that the hopes are in a bad place, but that he will turn it back again.
Hearts will fight SFA for the accusation of Neilson and Warburton will be cautious with January new commitments that could destroy the unit of the kader
Donations Increase Leadership Over Celtic to Five Points
ADAM Rooney's eleven meters in the first half gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons created a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths is talking about disharmony.
There are rumors about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team colleagues are not under increased control as they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we're feeling under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football tired the Netherlands - de Boer
The former Rangers midfield player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands they no longer show highlights of the Celtic games and why?"
This is because the Rangers are not there.
People here don’t just talk about the return of the Rangers.
They are talking about the old company.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what they’re interested in.
There’s a lot of tension in the old company games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I’m going to turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian boss has pledged to turn things back.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points in advance.
Deila said, “Celtic had bad times before, and we’ll come back.”
Now we want to get out as quickly as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what’s happening.
We feel exactly that way, but we have to go on.
We really need Celtic’s support because it makes the players better.
Meeting is so important now.
Warburton cautious at January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago that indicated that he recorded some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when signing new entries and insists that he does not want to disturb the unit of the Ibrox frame.
The former head of Brentford said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you’ve seen with our own group in this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea Stormer Michu, in conversation with Celtic during the transfer period, said he could withdraw if his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has plagued himself with a annoying knife for two years and failed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts suspends SFA battle due to Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1, when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Defender's Red Card was later withdrawn - the third Red Card of Collum, which was withdrawn in eight months.
Neilson remains in what he said, insisting: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The improved Hibee was rejected after he acknowledged to have sang a song with offensive texts about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a shop in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the storm said, adding, "It's safe to say that I won't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Board has trust in Dundee-United management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but acknowledges that the fall on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We will bring the boys back to Trab,” Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes acknowledges that his Aberdeen team had to desperately fight against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that gave them a five-point advance over Celtic at the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's eleven-meter in the first half.
McInnes said, “There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues, which has never won this kind of games.”
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while its overall growth in the UK.
The unemployment rate in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July at 164,000, while the number of unemployed people for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was higher than the UK’s 5.5 percent, according to figures from the National Bureau of Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74,0 percent during the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The long-term plan of the government has placed the foundation for a stronger economy."
It’s almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunk people disrupted the course.
As the security personnel were unable to resolve the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray the officials were able to take the strikers in custody.
A breath alcohol test resulted in a 16-year-old 0.89 promiles.
The adult was taken from his mother.
A 28-year-old man had 2.15 promiles and was first in custody.
Why I'll be a witness of an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is killed.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn’t happen, I’ll sit in a audience gallery in the death room at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January on his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day came closer, I began to be afraid.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and since there are often more applications than places available, a makable lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will be watching it emotionally.
I can’t.
I’m going to sit next to Richard Glossips’ closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it, and you get access.
I complain to her.
She insisted that she "will have been able to formulate it better", but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what I have to write, and I’t do it even if he would do it.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the publicity work of the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post reporter, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I’ve done.
I don’t want to get into all the details here again.
I can’t say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would blame him to be a beneficiary of the act.
But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of the murder.
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I will see him die.
I can’t claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can contact for this.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after wet police pursuit persuaded to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry when he convinced the man from the Canning River.
A attempt of a man from Perth to pull off the police was unsuccessful when he was in the soak and sweepy water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to “sweeply convince him to return to the shore.”
The police of Canning Vale was called for a house breakdown attack in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them toward the Canning River.
But he didn’t get too far.
“He stood in the water and said ‘I don’t come out, come and take me,’ said senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to make his uniform wet, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - "A good police officer negotiates."
“Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape,” said senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the tombs to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful but inspired local people to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy him and threatens to end the racing sport
Peter Moody claims that Racing Victoria’s Stewards tried to install a spy in his places last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the Stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s late scratching due to a race-day treatment, the last strohhalm on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what’s best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive Kobalt-Tupper sample at Lidaris that he couldn’t explain.
He had held up for 18 months because of the spying accusations and didn’t want it to “look like too high hanging grapes.”
“I had no intention to say anything about it, and I’ve been sitting there for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that everything comes out at once,” Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I’m going to go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around elevated heads, and I want my owners to think I’m trying my best for them.
If you start thinking I don’t do it, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had laid the bomb up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy his stall.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man – whom I’m going to name when I’m asked – and offered him a job in my places to provide information about what I’m doing within my places,” Moody told Racing.com.
You obviously believe that I am a scammers.
If that’s the case, they should definitely stick to their nose because they’ve failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, Executive Chairman of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current Chairman of the RVL, were aware of it at the time and are still today.
Should this bring me to the view that it will be personal?
Has the RVL behaved feedy and makes people outside the coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Are I bad for the industry?
Is it so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think that I am it.
Per you have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I say will let you think about it now.
But now I’ve reached the point where I don’t care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will exercise pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The trainer's frustration levels have grown up with the long-lasting Kobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led to him saying that he "may be able to throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the untouched master Black Caviar, called the race-day treatment rule "smiling" after a package of slam or tone was applied to the horse legs, which dropped against the rules.
“It is contrary to the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
“One of my employees mistakenly applied slam on the leg.
It could have been so yesterday night.
It could have been the whole day, whatever it was.
It was the same on the day of the race.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the package on the day of the race.
It is a joke.
People who set these rules know nothing about the horse.
“We all realize that we need rules, but here we’ve gone too far,” Moody said.
Man arrested after driver escape
Police arrested a man on a weekend after a collision with a bicycle driver and subsequent driver escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was transported with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley Highway.
Police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia appeared to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged for driver escape and lack of assistance and for other traffic crimes.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram remains in the hospital. he is in a stable state.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy Shoots Against Rivals For Claims of Ring Fighting
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has criticized the tackling of his players as the "Agenda Setting" of two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the judges allowed the Storm players "ring battles" with their team during the high Storm victory in the qualification final in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a hardly hidden comment on the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "example" of the Rugby League and said the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the tacklimg of his team and said they were only focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team convinced him, as it meant that they were worried about being hit by the Storm team.
"It's happening again and again - I haven't heard that Trent Robinson talked about ring battles when they hit us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defense system or techniques throughout the year. But in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has given us the trend turn.
Trent is now there for three years, and he obviously has a great team to train. He is therefore probably not used to losing, so it was a little shock for him.
It is strange how this happens at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "spanning football" and reminds his mentor that Bennett's St. George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "unpleasant" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting his game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he would take care of a crazy drink.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all of his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like these.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn’t think of us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs Roosters achieved a higher outcome than the game Broncos vs Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven’t seen it yet, but what was the result? 16:12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it an exciting game?
Or are pauses and no points something exciting?
For me, it is the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will still meet them at a stage.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to either receive North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening in the pre-finals at AAMI Park.
Serbian with $200,000 deposit after drug accusation
A man who could be threatened to a lifelong punishment for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine that were smuggled to Queensland was released against a $200,000 deposit.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and deployed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed as he met his colleagues in the jachthafen during the morning and later in the Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possibly lifelong punishment for attempting to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that it could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of fleeing at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case, he lie to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovich's mother and father had offered a deposit of $200,000 as a security together to his release.
“After reading the alleged statements of the two persons, it is clear that imposing a $200,000 security is a real financial burden,” Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against deposit, under the conditions that he issued his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily and holds on a starting blockage from 18:00 to 06:00.

Stevan Hogg used the phone of girls to attract pedophiles to send images
A pedophiler used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when this slept, logged in to an online messaging service from which he received a series of uncomfortable pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through, found the confusing news and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed the computers found under the address and discovered "right" web searches that used the terms for searching for incomprehensible images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to "pedophiles on the internet" and he then "forced to be a police officer to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to attract her.
He said he was sick in his head when he drinks, and said he would then want to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and was cried and crying.
She also saw the unacceptable pictures on the phone and faced the accused with it.
The girl was interviewed and said the accused used the computer and PlayStation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the accusation, having taken unacceptable pictures of children on 14 June last year, having violated the rules on 25 January of this year and not appeared in court for a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to appear in the register of sexual criminals, as it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" was found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael delayed the judgment until October to receive background reports on social work.
In this case, Hogg was granted a deposit, but was held in detention for hearing on other cases that were still outstanding.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of judgment.
Crossing for small border crossing to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken away from the major control points on the German-Austrian border.
Many locks left people more and more on smaller border crossing for fear of discovery and arrest.
On the Austrian side, a spokesman for the federal police said.
During the Border River Inn, more than 1,000 refugees have been captured in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They were walking through bridges and stauwehre arrived on the German side.
There they are received by federal police officers and transferred to registration.
According to federal police reports, more refugees arrived at the main train station in Munich on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
Only until 8 p.m. about 700 people arrived in the country’s capital, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border on Tuesday 1759 refugees had reached the city.
Stuttgart: Tropical storm "Henry" is expected in southwest
Meteorologists warn of storms in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, hot sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart.
The powerful depth is the outlet of the tropical storm "Henry", which has been pulled over the Atlantic over the Bermuda Islands in recent days.
Strong storms and storms are expected especially in the bathroom.
According to DWD, it is expected until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest, on the Schwäbische Alb and in the ground sea circle with boys of 60 to 90 hours kilometers.
On Friday, the sun can be seen longer.
The masses do it: Every two years the automotive manufacturers on the IAA show their news.
2015 is moving in the compact cars, which are currently selling well.
Compact-class cars are currently in particular demand: About 28.1 percent of the new licenses, according to the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) in August alone, go to this segment.
This is also reflected in the IAA (public days 17-27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premiums for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will stand with the dealers in the autumn.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us,” Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the exhibition.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to be well sold, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel is expected to start under the largest competitor VW Golf, starting at €17,650.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4 litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hessen offers additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW/200 PS, among which for the first time are also three-cylinder gasoline engines.
Unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is first only the fifth door.
The second variant will be followed in the spring of the combi, which is already seen on the IAA.
And what will happen next to the Astra on the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane to the race.
At the exhibition, the Mégane will be seen exclusively as the fifth door in a conventional and emphasized sporty GT version.
It comes to the market in the beginning of next year, then as a combi.
Infiniti is the new in the segment, the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan buyer wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model.
In this way, the compact Infiniti with its twisted lines fully fits the brand’s design line.
The basic model will get a benzin engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
But there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model will be offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum rotation moment is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to manufacturers.
Baleno starts sale in Europe in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but around renewed is the compact-class model DS 4, which is visible on the IAA.
Outdoors, the designers of the noble Citroën coaster first handed on the front part: here the refrigerator grill was repainted and the modified lights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, mainly, the infotainment system has been modernized, the number of buttons has been reduced by a touch screen and Apple’s CarPlay has been integrated for the first time.
In addition, the IAA in the compact class will include a series of revisions and new variants such as the refreshing Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell is inhuman
The Federal Constitutional Court has given righteousness to a former prisoner of the justice agency Tegel, who had been housed in a too small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are essentially entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision released on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the affected persons may even hope for money if they were locked in too narrow spaces for a few days (cf. 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, a former prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was placed in the Berlin-Tegel Court of Justice between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of ground area; the toilet was not spatially separated.
After that, the man, who, according to his lawyer, is now on his foot again, was moved into a larger cell.
His arrest case for the unworthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges raised the ruling of the Chamber Court of Berlin and recalled the case for re-examination there.
They see the man’s dignity damaged.
The court now decides on the amount of compensation
Although, for legal reasons, only a few days of imprisonment from the period in question are essential for the compensation, a compensation claim is given, it said.
Otherwise, it would be "a prejudice to the legal protection of the personality."
The Chamber Court now has to clarify the amount of compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
It was not until April that they gave a damages to a prisoner because he was naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, it is inhuman to multiply placing a cell without a separate toilet.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which confirmed a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 an inhumane accommodation.
The then prosecutor was housed between 15 and 21 hours a day for three months in a cell similar to Karlsruhe case.
In the last few weeks, the Berlin prisons have also come to the tracks because of the lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore constantly imprisoned for 23 hours, the aggression is increasing, even the strikes may have already come due to the stressful situation.
According to the judicial press office, 21 offices in Tegel are not occupied due to youth misconduct, 19 are expected to fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: “We can do that”
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge – the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What happens to Germany?
About 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do that, and we can do it."
What is going on in Germany is the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (as estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (as estimated by the Pestel Institute) houses are used annually - and that is for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it is currently being built (250,000 apartments).
But the lack of housing is dramatic, especially with affordable rental objects: annually 60,000 to 80,000 social houses fall out of the rental price bond, and for these affordable houses refugees will also apply.
Federal construction minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80,000 social houses should be created annually, and for this, the Federation should invest a grant of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in housing.
According to the Institute for Labour and Occupational Research, it is predicted that in the long term 55 percent of refugees in Germany may be employed.
However, the refugees in Germany would not systematically ask for their qualifications to help them enter, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
But for the integration of refugees, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to appreciation in the reception society, but also to the self-esteem of migrants, says Migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political shift: from the ban on work for refugees to the recognition of work.
While before there was a job prohibition for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence obligation that limited asylum seekers to one place of residence.
In society, also due to the lack of professionalism, the view has mostly been adopted that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market faster.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.
Until now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, according to Thränhardt, the royal way to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to the Kitas, estimated to be 10 to 15 percent: “For the corrupt parents it is very important to keep the family together first,” says Ilja Koschembar, spokeswoman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
To persuade the family of the benefits of the kit, the administration distributes handcards in different languages.
If the need for educators increased significantly due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education – for example by allowing more specialized schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge are prepared for the lesson in welcome classes.
But they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage to them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Administration.
The German Student Work estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal country prohibits asylum seekers or patience to study - the only exception until now was Berlin, the internist Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his position.
Studying willing refugees could be facilitated access to college.
Because refugees with a residence status or duration will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Appeal Law when they start a study.
The latter, in principle, does not receive Bafög, as they do not fall under the circle of Bafög permitted persons.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be entitled to Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this span is shortened to 15 months.
But this financing gap must also be closed, says Steffen Krach, Berlin’s Secretary of State for Science, and the German Student Work.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, as many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop the existing state-church law to a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that will take care of the newcomers professionally.
The rights include obligations.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and provide it with certain possibilities of control.
This also includes the willingness to act sharply against religious fundamentalism.
The Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, on Thursday expressed concerns that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany.
Those who wanted to cause such conflicts in Germany "have their right to stay here, in Germany, immediately confused," he said in the Bavarian Radio.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more than today a topic for the whole society.
This will need to change the majority society as well, the decrease of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany has – as a result of European decisions – for a few decades a anti-discrimination body and a General Equality Act.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What immigrant organizations and non-German interest groups have long demanded and what international agreements such as the Anti-Rassism Convention Germany are committed to must become a reality in the coming years, if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their possibilities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees, said Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
“As for man-power and capabilities, we can do that,” he said to the daylight.
However, extra money needs to be flowed into the system.
In order to avoid interruptions, Montgomery calls for all recipients to send health cards at the same time when registering.
The benefits provided could later be calculated with the federal states.
And in the long run it is highly controversial to eat so many people with the limited performance catalog that the Asylum Applicants Service Act provides for.
Otherwise, the doctors first and foremost create language barriers.
So far, the Berliner health scientist Thea Borde has shown that migrants are getting worse informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practitioners, interpretation costs should be charged.
Many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contacts in the emergency ambulance.
With a different diagnostic view.
Among refugee children, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people it is about HIV disclosure.
But with the partially other illness images, German doctors come clear from their training, Montgomery says.
"Parasite attack or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize."And as regards the lack of doctors, the refugees may even see relief in sight.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, some refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practice, they must prove their qualifications and possibly submit exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psychically ill, according to the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK), most of them suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Particularly vulnerable are refugee children, says Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study by the TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatically in Germany.
Those who are affected by a post-traumatic stress disorder, among other things, suffer from so-called flashbacks with depression, swelling, heartbeat and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong horror and emotional foolishness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
Until now, only 4 percent of psychically ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although psychically ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will often decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.
This often leads to errors, says Munz.
Manege invites to dream
With the new inscenation "Passion", the Circus Probst invades the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the ban of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressings and unique entertainment.
Currently, the Circus Probst invites you to the maneuver on the mirror to dream.
“Our passion is the circus.”
“I can’t imagine living without my circus family,” says Stephanie Probst, veterinary teacher and junior manager.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current maneuvering scenario.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family.
The gift to the enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
“It’s important for us to get the people away from their daily trouble and take them to a completely different world for two hours,” the 27-year-old junior boss emphasizes.
“Manegencocktail with World City-Flair,” said director Reinhard Probst.
50 cities on the almost 3,000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flower.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with joke and charm.
Castillo Brothers also understand their crafts.
With the heroes of the stupid films, the Cuban duo wants to take it lightly.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the Mast is intended to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with fingerprints and jointness.
Balancing with the wheel on a ball?
He Yuan is no problem.
Serpent people fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinated by its mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in all respects.
“The animals belong to our family,” says Stephani’s mother, Brigitte Probst.
Mistakes in the attitude of circus animals are just too often a topic in various animal protection organizations.
Stephanie Probst said, “If our animals are not well, we are not well.”
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each strip unit.
The “four-foot artists,” as they are lovingly called, will, if possible, be read away from the eyes of any desire.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn’t feel good, it doesn’t want to go into the maneuver.
The highest commandment is to take care of the animals.
Specifically on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPony and a Zebrastute, the family is proud of Probst.
The two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing has happened.
“But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there,” says Brigitte Probst.
Although the Zebroid is not yet ready for the maneuver, it is the unique maskot of the Circus Probst.
For every visitor there should be something.
“One is safe,” says Stephanie Probst, “whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are with all our heart.”
The Circus Probst invites to its presentations from 17 to 20 September every day at 17 and 20 p.m.
The program begins on Sunday at 11 and 16 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the show at 17:00 the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 to 18 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium in early year.
He remained not injured, but the video of the case quickly spread through social media.
The opening of the parliament was also stumbled by claims from opposition members that they had received anonymous death threats and they were warned not to accompany Mr. Mugabe's speech with bullshit.
Last month they had burned him out and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones warning them of disturbing Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
“The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title ‘Death’,” he said to journalists for Mugabe’s speech.
It warns the affected parliamentary members that immunity in parliament ends, and once they leave parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "careful" about the dangers for the politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings efforts in the company’s services.
HP will divide itself into two stock marketed companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its rapidly growing corporate hardware and service business.
The expected decrease leads to a burden of more than $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP’s Chairman and Chief Executive, who is intended to lead the unit after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of shops that support companies in the transition to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenues and will “be focused on providing unrealised, integrated technology solutions for,” the company said in a statement.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical plants and whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to deal with the deviation from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The action of HP, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. technology companies, is the latest in this field, based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team colleagues must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it’s only September and if his rehabilitation is scheduled, there’s no reason why he can’t play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England, and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is surely still uncertain.
The great shame with this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season strongly after a separate knife injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre-season.
“This kind of injury does not threaten the career,” Wenger said.
It’s a bone that didn’t heal well.
This is not a bigger matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not associated with his knives or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
The study by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal 157 league games in the last five games.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight games since 2007/08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that had the most injuries to record.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injuries will continue during the last season.
“Sometimes when you come back from a injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you have to strengthen your body and gain fighting power,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome it.
I hope his body will stabilize, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves.
Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger plays a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are expected to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give a little break to the players that need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is clearly favourite to go through Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most intimidating sites in Europe.
Dynamo is also unsuccessful after 41 games after the “unbeaten” campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shocked by a earthquake on Tuesday night, with a measurement of 3.2 on the judge scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has taken the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the far hope to lead the team to its first European Cup triumph with his management.
“This drive is immense,” Wenger said.
It has never succeeded in Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I’m long enough in the business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreams.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar performances in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year-old high show.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Man's Year, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the patient had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risk of mental problems.
But, of course, you must first have friends so that friendship can work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediate response is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to look strong, lively and successful, even though in reality the isolation is dominated.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much deeper.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money cannot really buy happiness.
The good thing with Friends was that this focus was placed on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which glowed through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent kisses, moments of football watching in comfortable seats and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can refer to it, even if they often refuse to fully explore their feelings.
As a telephone psychiatrist explained to me:... “My hearing error role for people who feel depressed and are at risk of suicide has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference.”
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old phrase “I’m going to deal with it” has an enormous effect, like the feeling that it’s perceived as weakness when you talk openly about problems.”
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
It clearly presents the little moments of men’s friendship.
As much as my objective external status via the phone can help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you’re visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely newly designed hall to celebrate the day, why not take your friends with you to a drink in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what the difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent on Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG break down Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.
Di Maria will meet at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and will help PSG move to Malmö.
Here is the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held the course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player that brought the French champion on the way, but then they missed a number of opportunities before they finally raised their advance when Cavani in the 61st minute got a headball tower.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they are not only seeking the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game by Laurent Blancs team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances before the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his home city team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career already in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League. Therefore it's a good start to win 2-0, cause problems to our enemies and look back calmly, even if there are certain things we still have to perfect throughout the season," Blanc said.
“This is a good example.
We wanted to win and we won, although I’m sorry we didn’t get one or two more goals.”
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned in one of three changes to the Paris team, which was able to keep a 2:2 disagreement on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was shot out in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing storm was named as the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was overtaken by Manchester United last month, and he pointed out why when he entered the Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he passed Johan Wiland beautifully into the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would a big victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, the Celtic shot in a play-off to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field.
But in addition to a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far to Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some faults and bad conclusions, not least by Ibrahimovic, who in no less than five attempts passed alone in the first half and was then given up after Cavani had used him after the re-start.
Nevertheless, he demonstrated much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a passport of Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria turned into a rotating shot that was pre-linked by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post ...
The second goal eventually fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. the Uruguay man achieved his sixth season after Ibrahimovic had swallowed a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before the replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was announced a goal at the end.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: “Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which has not the same level.
The qualifications are not enough.”
Take a hat from Paris.
It was a great game of them!
Glencore gathers $2.5 billion through stock sales
Switzerland-based mining riese Glencore, which is affected by crashing raw materials prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt compensation plan.
The London registered company Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling raw materials prices as China’s economic recession pushes demand and devastatingly affects the markets.
The issuance of reference rights brought Glencore’s stock price to a rapid rise in trading early Wednesday morning to the top of the London Stock Exchange.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had last week announced the $2.5 billion stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to withdraw about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4-percent drop on the final rate on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Fears about a long-term slow growth in China have cut iron prices by about half, coal, copper and other raw materials prices have dropped by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrived in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reached the city administration in Weimar after a long escape.
The refugees are from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest receiver is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of this month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi’s first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and responds to President Barack Obama’s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state din after the two leaders held bilateral talks this evening.
“President Xi’s visit will provide the opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a series of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, but at the same time also give President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disputes constructively,” the statement added.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before he continues to New York City for the United Nations General Assembly in September.
It is expected that Obama and Xi address a number of controversial questions, including Washington’s concerns regarding alleged cyber spionage of China and its increasing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440 PS sports car rented and driven to shrink
A 29-year-old man wanted to fulfill a dream and laid out a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway, the evil awakening came.
With a company in the County of Gotha, you can fulfill your dream and once borrow and drive a V8 U.S. sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
This was the case with a 29-year-old man from the County of Gotha.
At the A 71 at Arnstadt, the dream was out and out.
The 29-year-old lost control over the sports car, knocked on a wet trail into the slopes and drove into the guidelines.
The car was damaged, no one was injured.
The damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevents transfer to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the Al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern obviously stood shortly before the commitment of the Spanish Superstar Xavi, who at the time played for the FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times poker winners, four times Champions League winners, two times club world champions, two times European champions, one time world champions - Xavi's title list is amazing.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the Al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now tells us that he was already before the 2008 EM before the farewell from Barcelona.
“I was told that Barça wanted to sell me.”
“Madrid won everything, we won nothing,” he said.
This is the case with FC Bayern.
Xavi: “There was an offer from Bayern.”
“Rummenigge wanted me.”
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change did not occur.
And the crucial man for this today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has signed a contract with Guardiola and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me I't change, he couldn't imagine the team without me."
“This is what he has striked me.”
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 match would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the Champions League quarterfinals against the Bayern over the entire distance on the grass, scored the Red (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the King's Triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon faced the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she would not be needed behind the scenes.
During a series of Sunday Night by HBO’s Project Greenlight, the experienced actor broke down when he emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the project’s chosen script.
“If we’re talking about diversity, then you’re doing it when you’re occupying the movie and not when you’re occupying the show,” Damon said.
Brown responded shocked, with insulted unbelief and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay" as the actor's comments of The Martian strengthened.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
“I want people to think – no matter who will be the director – how they treat the figure of Harmony,” Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a nutt that is hit by her white tiger.
Dear White People's producer set himself for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights on the film; Damon replied that their directing "at the end could give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded for disagreement about Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WISS that it hurt."
The tweet has earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its publication.
Damon’s comments come at a time when accurate racist representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained country-wide impact and urged lawmakers and authorities to promote discriminatory practices against colour content.
In February, the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
“Albums still matter” (Albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
Recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck’s question whether the group should be seen as a hatred group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the leaders said.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moulds who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior is the first champion.
Professional sports clayer and service assistant Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and take the $1 million Grand Prix home.
The competition show, which just finished its seventh season, had never experienced a competition player who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season final, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, succeeded in the final.
The last task was to climb on a 75-foot climb in 30 seconds.
Britten ended the task within the time, making him the first athlete to complete the anxious Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero ended this challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard-fighted victory, still under the shock about the winning of the Great Prize of $1 million.
"I mean it's amazing to think about, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," Isaac E! said about his crowd of money.
So suddenly... as I can’t even imagine how it is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the parcours at all, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
“When there is more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time gets it,” Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and changes life, it gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's making any grief about it.
He is just so happy to have done what he has done.
He received a lot of awards from fans.
He is such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be hit by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for a real season, the screenplay will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers Passed to Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Previously they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are on the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as a spoiler, but they played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field.
The Twins lost a chance to rise within a game half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard place.
For Detroit, though only for one night, it was a return of the three letters F-word that was so hard to catch over a large part of the second half of the season.
“All victories are fun, no matter how it comes,” said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon retained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was his third successful start in his last nine matches.
“I want to end this year strongly,” Simon said.
It’s hard to throw any game into the bull, and that’s why I want to get into the game fully focused.
The designed Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two rounds, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez’s first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
“He has pushed the shock wood well,” Ausmus said.
He looked good at the (shock training), looked much better in the bull, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three runs in the back match at the end of the seventh innings, the Twins had their best chance to come back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before he was replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived the Wall, the only man he was faced with, before the designed Rookie striker Miguel Sano, who crossed a two-run to the right hand Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of runners and the final run in the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a Double Play.
It was the Major League leader 27th time in this season that Plouffe hit a Double Play
After Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth innings, Wall made a RBI double against the Closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and achieved the stand of 5-4.
The right hand, however, scored Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of the start of the game by a still unmoving Phil Hughes.
The Tigers achieved three runs in the first two innings against the right hand veteran, who had been removed from the injured list before the game after he had missed more than a month due to a back pain.
“Obviously not the beginning I wanted,” Hughes said, “but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning.”
After they got the Leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A Two-Out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right side, made another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, achieving a One-Out Double by Catcher James McCann and a Two-Out Single by Center Field Anthony Gose to 3-0.
“It was a big blow,” Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn’t hit very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a Pitch Count, did not score points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reliever right hand A.J.Achter.
With Hughes, there were three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTE: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was dismissed for a wound of the wreck.
He is investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injured in a shoulder crash since mid-August, is expected to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris will be removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30th.
He has been missing since August 20 due to a breakdown in the right column.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games on Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are expected to go to Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for Wednesday night.
The people who arrived there should then be housed in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday night.
There were 450 to 750 refugees arriving.
Several sports halls in the country’s capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can stay temporarily there.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
Only in the last ten days, according to the government’s prime minister Gießen, 7500 people had arrived in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also established emergency accommodations in sports halls due to the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria is an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military action with German involvement in Syria as an opportunity.
“I believe that the decisive thought of military action options should not take place without Germany,” he said.
He called for the European countries to "collective discourse".
Four years ago, we were glad that the Kelch of a military involvement in Germany passed.
“Now the conflict is crumbling in front of our door,” he said in Germany.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the site for the refugees.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday night in the Austrian television channel ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has not returned refugees to Austria.
“No, that’s agreed,” she said.
On the question of an agreement, according to which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there have already been talks on this issue between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention specific numbers and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have arrived to Austria through the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU leaders, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany began temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have not yet agreed on a joint action in the crisis.
The Ministers of the EU’s internal affairs will take on a special meeting on Tuesday (22 September) a new step towards the binding distribution of another 120,000 refugees.
Given the strong refugees in Germany, the Federation wants to support the countries in the first reception and distribution of people.
The Bund will manage this in conjunction with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday after almost four-hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor's office in Berlin.
Merkel emphasized that those people who needed protection will receive this as well.
Those who do not have a residence perspective cannot stay in Germany.
This view has been clearly shared in the round.
The Chancellor emphasized that the state as a whole must now face a "right effort of power".
Thousands of desperate refugees are still on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175 kilometers long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also turn off the border with Romania with a curtain.
This neighboring country is a member of the EU unlike Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent shippers from seeking escape routes across Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on the planned new border zone.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were the first arrests of people who had broken the yard.
According to eye witnesses, thousands of migrants were on the way to the Greek border.
Cassini spacecraft finds the ocean on Saturn moon Enceladus
Under the glacier of Saturn’s moon Enceladus, a global ocean is floating.
This is the conclusion of researchers from observations of the "Cassini" spacecraft.
Thus, the moon slightly turns around the ring planet on its track.
Although this bull movement is small, it is yet too large for a constantly fixed heavenly body, it is said in a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca (US State of New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
In 2006, Cassini had discovered ice volcanoes on the South Pole of the Saturn Moon, which spray water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called E-Ring of Saturn.
At least in the South Pole there should be a subterranean sea, the astronomers concluded at that time.
However, the extension of the hidden ocean was not cleared.
Rama lacks 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must give up the offensive agent Valdet Rama for about a month.
A study found an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association.
Rama had complained about pain earlier this week.
According to Munich Lion, the diagnosis "probably means four weeks of forced break."
“It’s hard for us, Rama is a hard loss.”
“Naturally we have to think now,” said sports director Necat Aygün to the “Bild” newspaper, looking at the possible commitment of an unified professional.
As a guest of training, however, the sixteen first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and had already signed a contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
Currently, Croatia has “the opportunity to demonstrate its abilities.”
Turner Rubin Okotie will be able to return to team training next week after his stroke.
The Austrian national player is scheduled to start training on Thursday.
Okotie had wounded himself in the match at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a heavy collision on his head.
However, against the first fears, he remained without a serious blessing.
No Diet Fruit – Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his weak line, he will often be removed from them.
Because mangos contain relatively a lot of sugar – especially sacharose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. Most importantly, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its predecessor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When purchasing, mangos should not be too soft or too solid and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone says nothing about how mature the fruit is - so even green mango can taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods.
A mango, however, also gives heart-thinking dishes a special note.
It mitigates the slightly bitter taste of some plate salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well to fish, birds, sheep and wild.
UPS, the U.S. packaging service, will resume up to 95,000 aid services for the Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are being sought.
In the past year, UPS had increased its staff for the holiday season by 95,000 aid.
In light of the growing online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have taken early steps since last year to be armed for the Christmas business.
Late delivery in 2013 brought harsh criticism to package services.
First the storm, then the cold front.
The next night in the valleys the Alpennord side of the Föhn breaks through, as Meteoschweiz on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and on the night of Thursday, the foon partly blows with storm strength through the foon.
After the opening on Thursday morning, we are crossed by a marked cold front, which brings strong rainfall, windbows and a temperature decline.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently on the forefront of an extensive deep pressure area over the British islands in a strong southwest stream.
On the Alpennord side in the night to Wednesday the feun breaks through the valleys.
Consequently, the feun blows up to Thursday morning in the feunters with boys ranging from 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and specifically in Urnerland partially also with over 100 km/h.
The flock can step-by-step to the adjacent middle land, and on the mountains there are even hurricanes of more than 120 km/h possible.
While in the north on Wednesday the stormy fever provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the moisture begins to flourish on the Alps.
There is rain, which lasts until Thursday night.
In sum, south of the Alps in the next 48 hours with partially more than 100 liters of rain per square meter, this has already fallen large amounts of rain in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the air is coming out to the Föhn, followed by a cold front with strong, partially striking rain from the west to the east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind rises strongly to stormy, and the temperatures decline significantly.
The following days are presented in the north in the autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it will be more sunny and warmer in the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome has a Martin-Luther Square.
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin-Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of the city president Ignazio Marino, a previously unnamed place in the park on the Oppio hill was buried on Wednesday in the name of the German Reformator.
At the Piazza Martin Lutero, he is now honored as a German theologian of the Reformation.
The park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name was requested by the work community of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, the priest of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the Pope for centuries as a minority often could only live their faith hidden.
With the place it will be visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome for a few months as a young Augustine monk around the year 1510/11.
He felt the city as an expired sins of Babylon.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him in his subsequent struggle against Rome, according to historians.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Evening Church with his theses against the trafficking of goods.
Hammer Artist Invested Three Years in Personal Interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golded) Dorn Crown is one of the main works that Otmar Old painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
Was the word at the beginning?
No, not with the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
At the beginning the picture was for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and wall.
His “language” with colourful colors and imaginative shapes has been preserved by the 75-year-old – which is in no way equivalent to “ funny” images.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, it can seem quite dark.
Over three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the “Book of All Books”.
There are cycles that are dedicated to topics such as crossroads, plagues, commandments or our fathers.
This has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther Publishing with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler Publishing with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who, on the basis of the painting, discussed the respective biblical positions.
He has interpreted the Bible places chosen by Otmar Old and thus "translated" into the present, in current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Old Painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and each a phrase by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts about the respective situation.
The jewelry band has golden letters.
So the 75-year-old allows equally twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
“There’s been the education with the pipeline,” Otmar Old remembers.
“I’ve tried to work on this, so that I might also be able to tolerate with the Lord Father again.”
His second concern is to help art again to greater importance in a fast-living time: “The perception of image worlds today is characterized by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is dismissed.
Artists have a different desire and desire to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
“I am a dinosaur.”
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to be “injected” into the images, to be influenced on themselves, to discover and to feel what power they have: “The image is looking for its opposite.”
Klaus Altepost said on Tuesday at the presentation of Otmar-Alt Bible at Otmar-Alt Foundation that he was “always” a lover of Otmar-Alt Art: “I like how he understands life with his images.”
Old did not pay attention to fully capturing the Bible, but chose the topics that were important to him, even mysterious.
“This was not a collaboration at the height,” says Altepost, “this is about the images, the text only explains.”
For Hans Möhler of the Luther Publishing, this work is an invitation to “deep his life and find freedom.”
Otmar Old’s images speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and the language of responsibility.
Part of the original - paper and wall paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will open on November 15 at Otmar-Alt Foundation.
The construction of the BMX metro is near
Plans made, place found, companies commissioned, land heads for a round course modeled: A year later almost everything was finished - but even before the official opening of the BMX metro was already finished.
Failures in politics and administration caused frustration, especially among the inhabitants who did not want to tolerate the train.
So hills removed, looking for a new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission.
The approval will take place in October, the First Municipality Council Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to inform the Children’s and Youth Committee.
“I hope that more visible things will happen this year,” she said.
It should then be started with the work of the former Hallenbad without a further memory break.
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB expands its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga puts a clear sign in the weekend.
Football is responding to the worsening situation in Germany and assures to the policy its help in dealing with the upcoming problems.
“I think this is our country’s biggest challenge since the reunification.”
“In principle, no one can say that it doesn’t matter to me, I have nothing to do with it.”
"It must be interested by everyone to get this topic into control," DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach said.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany.
“I’m next Wednesday at the Chancellor’s office and I’ll meet there with the Minister of State Mrs. Özoğuz and the Chancellor.”
“There will be a central role in the subject,” he said.
Football can and wants to help.
The critical steps must be made by the policy.
The German Football Federation has extended its refugee initiative “1:0 for a welcome” for four years.
“On the Egidius-Braun Foundation, we have made sure that this program will continue until 2019,” Niersbach said at the edition of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian’s/Malta.
Some Bundesligists also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professionals will put a clear sign when they will be wearing the sign "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left shirt instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
“We want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can,” Leverkusen’s sports chief Rudi Völler told the “Bild” newspaper on Tuesday, calling the project “self-consciousness.”
“The refugee drama is about everyone, no one can look away.”
“We can, no, we have to use our power, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly,” Hertha’s manager Michael Preetz said.
Hoffenheim’s chief executive Peter Rettig spoke of a “prominent sign of the League.”
The women’s national team will invite 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the qualifying match against Hungary on Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community work of German football."
That all 36 licensing associations had launched their own projects in their locations is great.
It is also great that small and small groups are active.
The message "1-0 for a welcome" that we have issued is lived in football.
“This is of great importance,” he said.
In this and next year, the Alliance, together with the DFB Selection and the Federal Government, will provide 300,000 euros each for the integration of refugees.
“The associations have already collected the entire amount for 2015,” Niersbach said.
Report: SAP’s chief executive loses an eye in an accident
The chief executive of Europe’s largest software group, Bill McDermott, has lost his left eye due to a collapse in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother’s house in the U.S., he fell on a glass of water that he had in his left hand after midnight, the Economic Week on Wednesday.
“He’s almost bleed, he’s been impotent, he’s then pulled out on the street – that’s what he told us last week,” said Hasso Plattner, the “WiWo” SAP co-founder.
But McDermott could follow his work.
“At the beginning of October we will meet before the Supervisory Council meeting in Walldorf,” Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager is present at the meeting and is “fullly working”.
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Tuesday Edition) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
“I’m full for SAP there, full in my job.”
“But of course, I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time,” McDermott said.
McDermott usually pendes between Germany and the United States, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
For him it is important to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Everything like this can happen."
“It’s important to get up when you fall.”
McLaren Pilot Magnussen Out of Fight
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and said he suffered the injury when he fell from the bike.
He therefore comes as little as the reserve driver for the two tribal pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB Without Reus vs Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the Gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a return from Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have endlessly broken.
The national player will be missing the table leader of the Bundesliga also in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00/Sky).
"We can't, unfortunately, take him back," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga tournament against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach revealed: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday."
Given the high burden of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his stammelf on the Reus position.
He also announced a change in the port position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
“He trains at an absolute top level,” the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in all European League games in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
He is likely to compete in the second game as well.
The investigative statement by co-player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, the middle-field player Julian Weigl considers understandable: "There is not Marco so wrong."
“I think we have a good chance to win the title.”
Robot cars: Government wants a leading role for Germany
Germany will, according to the will of the federal government, be the technological pioneer in the change of the car.
The Federal Cabinet on Wednesday adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the border of the IAA Automesse about a "new age of mobility".
Automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and provide fewer stages, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who will meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transportation’s strategic paper emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband development and a rapid transition to digital hearing.
The new technology is being tested on Bahrain Highway 9.
In order to “no additional responsibility risks” to the driver, the federal government wants to “control the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments.”
Germany is committed to increasing the maximum speed permitted for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour.
The Federal Government will also pursue an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
With automated driving, the car increasingly takes over the driver, the driver becomes more and more the passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in a second speed.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy, high-automated driving on highways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, unmanned vehicles on public roads are “far after 2020 to be expected.”
The value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and high-automated driving functions at the site Germany is estimated by the authors of the study to approximately EUR 8.4 billion by 2025.
“The digital networking of the PKW can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic,” said SPD traffic politician Sören Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in cases of accidents and the security of the driver’s personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical – much more than the French or the Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on Wednesday on behalf of the test organization Decra concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be implemented in the next ten years, 32 percent expect it only in 20 years, 31 percent don’t believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, while in the United States, 33 percent.
Nevertheless, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to fully rely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give control during the entire journey on all roads.
On the highway, it could be 15 percent in the flowing traffic, 45 percent in the stack.
Well, one in four would not leave the car under any circumstances.
Boll announces team and double start at table tennis EM
The Dusseldorfer will, according to the current state, only target in individual in the title battles from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision should be made at the latest on 22 September.
“This is a huge loss for our team.”
“The guys learned it in the morning.”
“But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo,” Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf said during the EM-learning in Düsseldorf.
Boll was at that time on the flight to a long-term arranged sponsorship in China.
The 34-year-old German champion will be returned on Friday.
“Without Timo is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favourite,” said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the list in Yekaterinburg, also reminded of the 2013 EM in Schwechat.
“Tom has also missed, and we have become European champions.”
“This is what we should focus on,” the world ranking fifth said.
English football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury in his right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defendant was hit in a tackling by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a rainbow in Bastian Schweinsteiger’s 20-year-old co-player.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax-figuren-grusel cabinet: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented a exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The peak points: Looking out of the window dolls that look terribly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion stage with Madonna's stage outfits - and making him put men in rocks.
"I can't say today that I'm the child terrible of skin couture because I have white hair."
“Then it was clear, now it’s real,” Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the Sidewalk to the Catwalk), which will be seen on September 18 at the Art Hall of the Hypo Culture Foundation, it is a fortune that the fashion maker has changed his initially rejecting attitude towards a view of his person.
In fact, he was opposed, because, “For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death,” he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in Canada’s Montreal and Paris Station.
“It’s so much more than just beautiful clothes,” said director of the art hall, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibitions give an insight into the hardly overlooking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever completing a training.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is an excellently choreographed overall artwork, for which a lot of effort was done: For example, a stylist was dedicated to hairstyle the dolls.
The manufacturers carried 14 tons of material to Munich, according to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Shortly before the start of the October festival, there was another special shower: a lederhosen outfit with corset.
Heidi met Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy is also seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer’s first, stunning fashion attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he attracted his Teddy's BHs and clothes, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll, his parents would not have allowed him.
The design of fashion he later taught himself.
He steal fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
I bought it later, of course.
For his first fashion show he was unable to pay for the models.
They did not get anything, but they were able to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of gardins - blue top as a fashion niche
Earlier it was about making meters in and around the long stick machines.
The stumbled substances and spots were created in large quantities for customers, which further processed them, for example, into roofs and gardens.
That alone doesn’t work anymore today, says Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Modespitze Plauen.
But fashion is important again.
In the early times of the Blue Peak, fashion played a greater role, was then pulled out by the home textile industry - and is now re-discovered as a niche.
Reinhardt says some examples: top in jewellery, accessories such as pockets and regional tracks.
Overall, the so-called vintage mode, which applies to past style times, represents an increasing order potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
They already make half of all the orders.
Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the Industry Association of Plauener Spitze and Stickereien.
Only you can wear the protected label.
Over the past 15 years, approximately 80 percent of the sales have broken down.
Private and wholesale are almost no longer there.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
Today, the massware is produced much cheaper in the Asian area and almost exclusively distributed through chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the United States.
There are reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to point through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: “Since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we are producing ecologically and socially tolerant.”
Reinhardt adds: “This also applies to the materials used.”
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Outdoor Centre of the West Saxony University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in sticker and peak.
To get somewhat opposed to competition from the Asian area, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the newest ideas of designers and the enterprises that have to think economically above all,” Schmidt says.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer stance.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball peak.
In some places, the machine has small boxes.
Blue Gold Schmied Meister Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: “I couldn’t start anything with traditional Blue Peak before.”
Now she uses the snowball peak for her jewellery.
In a heavy procedure, she painted the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Plauener Top - young and old," says Reuter.
It also supplies to the United States, Australia and Finland – especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want a memory piece.
Thus I see my jewelry as the modern ambassador of the Plauener Top.
Disney plans new Mary Poppins movie
It’s not to be a legend, but Disney is still wishing to make a new movie of his classic “Mary Poppins”.
However, according to Entertainment Weekly, it’s not a re-film, but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first movie with the magical girl.
It’s about Nanny’s experiences with the Banks family in the times of the world economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins for more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already clear: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy broader to the world
The economy needs to open to the outside to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday to a group commissioned to lead the reform.
“China should engage in attracting foreign investments and expertise and improving business-starting strategies,” he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Promoting re-establishments and promoting reforms will bring new trend and vitality and provide new places for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list on the regulation of market access, relaxing the border control policy, promoting the state enterprises (SOE), taking private capital, and regaining the resident-money system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be created identifying the sectors and companies that are not in question for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved through test programs.
The initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also facilitate controls over the powers transferred to companies and ensure that companies decide how they run their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, additional areas will be opened for private investments.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-financed companies and provide better services to them,” the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the “Green Card” by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee their activities and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also attended Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double the silver limit in fisheries
The European Commission aims to double the limits for silver in large fisheries and thus provide consumers with a significantly higher dose of nerve loss.
The consumer organization Foodwatch, which has a relevant EU work paper, has sharply criticized the plans: “The risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies will be communicated with full enthusiasm to pregnant women and infants,” said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit levels of nerve loss for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as ha or sword fish for "economic reasons" should be increased from one to two milligrams of silver per kilogram of fish.
However, large fishing fish are already so burdened with silver that, on the basis of the remaining limit values, about 50 percent of the fishing is not allowed to be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unselled.
In return for this lock, the EU intends, according to Foodwatch, to strengthen the limits for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of silver per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, called this a “trick” because smaller peasants, such as carpets, are usually so low that they meet the planned maximum values already today.
The decrease in Kleinfisch is therefore "a foolish distraction maneuver that alone helps the economy," Wolfschmidt said.
Silk silver is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans and is highly enriched through the food chain, especially in fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that “ready small amounts can cause, especially in the case of unborn damage to the nervous system.”
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment declares on its website with regard to the current maximum values that a "health threat to the general population" is not to be expected.
Silver comes into the environment primarily through coal burning.
According to a written statement by the Federal Environment Ministry, German coal power plants hit the Green-Bundestag deputy Annalena Baerbock more than six tons of silver per year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of silver in fish in Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube is “permanently and surface-coveringly exceeded,” the “Spiegel” said in March from the paper.
Last year, European warnings against silver in fish were already among the most commonly health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
