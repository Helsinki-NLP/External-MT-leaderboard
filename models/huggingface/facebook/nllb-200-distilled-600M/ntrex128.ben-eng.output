Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned about their own appearance as carpets.
Several Assembly members are worried about changing their titles to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Wesch Parliament is a cause of this panic.
Members of the assemblies of various political parties are fearful of being ridiculed for the name change.
A Labour Party Assembly member said his party was concerned that the new position would be in line with the Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Welsh: In Welsh, Twp means fool and Pwp means filth.
A Pled assembly member said they were "not happy" as a team and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said the party was "open-minded" about the name change but noted that the pronunciation difference between MWP and MP was slight.
In this sense, the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of the W of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the provisions for the start of the name change process, said: "The final decision on the details of the position of the members of the Assembly shall be taken by the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change their name.
In June the Commission published the results of a referendum in which the proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament received widespread support.
As for the rank of Assembly Members, the Commission is supporting the Welsh Member of Parliament or WMP, but the MWP has the most support in the public.
Apparently, the members of the assembly are suggesting different options, but it will be difficult for the presiding officer, Ellen Jones, who is due to submit a draft resolution within weeks, to reach a consensus.
The reform bill will include changes to the working of the Assembly including disability of Assembly members and design of committee structure.
After the debate on the provision, the members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to vote on their position.
Macedonians are voting in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will cast their ballots on Sunday to decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was held to avoid decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour is a sign of a claim to their territory and has repeatedly objected to the country's application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian president, George Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, believe that the name change is only a necessary step to join the European Union and NATO.
The churches of Harlem are still silent as the St. Martin's fruit bell rings.
"The elderly people I spoke to said that historically there was a church and a pub in every corner", said Mr Adams.
"There's none of it today".
He said that the removal of the panshala is understandable.
Today, "social communication is different".
"The panshalas are no longer the area's living quarters where everyone goes on a regular basis".
In the case of the church, he is concerned that the money sold for property will not last as long as the leaders think, and today and tomorrow, they will return to where they started.
He also said that apartments and condominiums could be built in place of churches where people who would not help the rest of the places of worship in the area would live.
"Most of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white", he said, "and so they will speed up the closing of these churches because most people who come to live in these condominiums are unlikely to be members of the church".
Both churches were founded by the White Congregations before Harlem became a black-dominated metropolis. The Metropolitan Community in 1870, and a decade later St. Martin's.
The Mule White Methodist congregation left the church in 1930.
A black congregation in the nearby worship took ownership of the building.
A black congregation under the Reverend John Howard Johnson took over St. Martin's, who led a boycott against retailers on A Hundred and Twenty Fifth Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, for refusing to hire and promote black workers.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but when the residents of Father Johnson's parish planned to restore it, they arranged for the construction of the Carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly titled the Carillon "Poor People's Hour".
The expert Carillon who played it last July called it something different: "a historical treasure" and "an incomparable historical instrument".
Tiffany Nying, an expert at the University of Michigan, said it was the world's first carillon to be served by a black ballad, played by Dionneo A. Lind, who was hired 18 years ago to play the larger carillon of Riverside Church.
Mr. Meriwether said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin's in the past few months is a complex case of architects and contractors who are appointed by the general leaders of the church or by the Episcopal dioceses.
The vestry is the governing body of the parish, which consists of general leaders. In July, they expressed concern that they thought the Diocese would transfer the cost of vestry, although vestry was not involved in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
Thirteen-year-old California girl was injured in a shark attack after diving to catch a spider.
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark attack after diving for a shark strike on Saturday, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. in Beacons Beach near Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told San Diego's KSWB TV that he heard the boy crying for help while diving for about half an hour with friends on Saturday morning and helped him out of the water by paddling there with a group of men.
Hamel said that at first he thought the boy was shouting for the joy of catching a spider, but then he realized that the boy, he was biting me!
It bit me!
Her voice was ripped open", Hamel said, as she approached the boy.
"I call out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There are sharks in the water!'" adds Hamel.
The boy was flown to Rudy Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of the attacking shark is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told a news briefing that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not identified as an endangered species.
Giles also said the victim suffered a serious injury to the upper part of his thigh.
Officials have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Soami in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles said that more than 135 species of sharks can be seen in the area, most of which are not dangerous.
Sensesbury is planning to enter the UK market
Sensbury's boots, superdrugs and dabenhams will compete with department store-like cosmetics-styled eyewear and specialist support staff.
As part of the UK's strong push to enter the £2.8 billion fashion market, the giant fashion islands will be launched in 11 stores nationwide and, if successful, in other stores.
The investment in transformation is coming as supermarkets are looking for new ways to fill shelves once filled with TVs, microwaves and home decor.
Sensbury says it will double its turnover to 3,000 products, including Revolution, Easy, Twizerman and Doctor Who for the first time.
Existing cosmetics ranges like Laurel, Mabelin and Bart's Beach will have more space for brands like shops like Boots.
The supermarket is launching its boutique make-up range with most products being vegan-friendly which has become very popular among young shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will conduct discount delivery testing at two Senceberry stores, the first of which launched last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will launch later this year at Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and small quantities of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to strive for increased customer attendance.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sensesbury, said the outlets should look like department stores as the supermarket chain is competing with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl and will have more services and non-food products.
Sensesbury has been setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and opening several Habitat since its acquisition of Argos and Habitat two years ago, which has increased grocery sales and made the acquisition more profitable, the company claims.
Previous efforts to demolish the supermarket and pharmacy department have failed.
Sensesbury experimented with a joint project with Fake Boots in the early 2000s but the project was halted due to a dispute over how to share profits from chemist's stores in supermarkets.
Sensesbury is adopting this new strategy after selling its 281-store pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy owner Selecio.
The company said Lloyds will be contributing to the plan by adding a luxury range of skincare brands, including La Roche Pose and Vishi in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sensbury, said: "We have changed the shields of our islands to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in recruiting specially trained staff who will be present to advise.
Our brand range is designed to meet all kinds of needs and with attractive environments and convenient locations, we have now become a reliable destination for displays that challenge old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones has been fired after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the £11m deal.
TV presenter Holly Willoughby has cancelled the deal with lifestyle brand Peter Jones, star of Dragon's Den, in order to focus on her new deal with Marx & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their household goods and brand trolleys.
The pair's business has been compared to the Gup brand of Gineth Paltrot.
The morning news anchor, 37, reported on her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willow has angered Dan's star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their exciting lifestyle brand business at the last minute with the intention of focusing on his new bumper deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was fired when Golden Girls TV admitted to a meeting at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that she had no time for their household goods and associated brand trolleys due to her new deal, which is worth up to £1.5 million.
The business was compared to Ginneth Paltrot's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
After announcing his departure from Truly on Instagram, Willowby, 37, Jones left the UK by jet for his holiday home.
A source said: "Troulee has been at the top of the list of Holi's priority so far.
This was part of his long-term future plan that would meet his economic needs for the next few decades.
His decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, the project was supposed to start soon.
Marlowe's headquarters has a warehouse filled with goods ready for sale".
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, who is currently one of Britain's most trusted stars, could cost the firm millions of pounds as they have already invested heavily in products ranging from cushions to candles, textiles and household goods, and the potential delay in its opening will add to the loss.
And that could lead to the end of a long friendship.
Willow, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for over a decade.
Willowby started Truly with Cap in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as president in March.
The couple spend holidays together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business transactions".
"We're in love with each other".
He mocked the North Korean leader for expressing a positive attitude and making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential".
Why did President Trump give so much credit?
Trump called his makie a "news presenter".
"I did not give any concessions".
He said Kim is looking forward to meeting for the second time after their initial meeting in Singapore in June.
But the talks on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no "relevant response" from the United States to North Korea's previous disarmament move.
He said that the United States has imposed sanctions for the purpose of pressure.
Trump expressed a more positive attitude during his speech at the rally.
"We are in a good position with North Korea", he said.
"We were facing war with North Korea.
It could have killed 10 million people.
We have a very good relationship now.
He claimed his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results which have led to the end of the rocket tests, helping to free the prisoners and bring back the remaining American personnel.
And she supported his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to behave like a president, but instead of standing outside 10,000 people in this crowded arena and trying to get in here, there are only 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed by tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign private companies were told they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international cooperation, so the issue is challenging", said Mr Sambag.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to go to Palo, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Bali to determine whether foreign agencies will be given the opportunity to participate in relief efforts.
Despite the frequent earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is poorly prepared to deal with the anger of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, shelters are also being seen in other coastal areas.
Despite the alert, the apparent lack of a tsunami warning in Pallu, possibly caused by the loss of life, has been a factor.
Even when the weather is very good, many Indonesian islands are challenging to travel to.
Natural disasters make communication systems more disadvantaged.
A ship dedicated to Lombu is heading to the hospital to clean up the victims, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has put the development of Indonesia's underground infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and he has invested huge sums of money in road and rail construction.
But the lack of investment before next year's re-election has dragged Mr. Joko's government.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from the long-running communal tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative lifestyle of their religion.
The riots between Christians and Muslims killed more than 1,000 people and left more than 10,000 homeless. The riots resulted in two groups fighting in the streets with daggers, arrows and other crude weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturges goal in the match against Chelsea
At Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday, Daniel Stirris saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by a goal in the 89th minute.
Shardan Shakiri's pass was received by the Stars, who were about 30 metres from the Chelsea goalpost, and his team was 1-0 behind.
He first took the ball to the left and then shot towards the distant post.
The shot goes to the top of the box in the right corner of the net.
The ball finally jumped through the Kepa Ariyabalaga and fell into the net.
"It's important to get in the right position to catch the ball on time, because players like Shaq always push the ball as far ahead as possible, so I was trying to give myself as much time as possible", Stirris told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I'll just hit a little bit when I see Kante coming forward and not think too much about the shot".
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime with Belgian star Eden Hazard scoring a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker also passed Kovacic in the match, then ran from midfield to Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic took the ball to the midfield.
He then gave Hazard a nice ball in the box in Liverpool's defence.
Hazard defeated the defensive players in a run and scored a goal on a left foot in the net of the away post.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, at 3pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face VideoTon in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are reportedly trapped in the ruins of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which hit last Friday and caused a 20-foot-high waterfall, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Pooreo Nugrao told a symposium.
The city of Pallu, with a population of 380,000, is filled with the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of killing a woman in a shootout
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was recovered in Barkenhead Merseyside this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman who was stabbed to death was found at the Grayson Museum on John Street at 7:55 a.m. today, a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have invited the public to inform them if they see or hear anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages but I would like to request that anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Barkenhead who sees or hears something suspicious contact us.
I would like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have any footage on the dash cameras, to contact us because they may have urgent information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman was a resident of Burkenhead and her body was found inside a house.
Friends who thought they knew the woman arrived at the scene this afternoon and asked where the woman's body was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they are trying to inform the woman's immediate family.
When a taxi driver at Grayson Muse tried to enter his flat, police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was shocked to hear about the incident.
Residents of the building are told that it will take several hours for them to enter.
A police officer was reportedly telling a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
He said it was a very sad thing.
At 2 p.m. two police vans were inside the barricades and another van was outside the barricades.
A group of police officers were monitoring the blocks of flats inside the barricades.

The statue of Parliament's Cromwell is the latest victim of a controversial history rewriting debate.
The statue will be removed in poetic justice after the Taliban destroyed many of England's cultural and religious monuments at the hands of its religious hardliners.
But the Cromwell Society has described Mr. Creek's advice as "an attempt to rewrite history and intelligence".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "The current dispute over the removal of the statue was inevitable as to the identity of the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster.
The iconoclaism or pattern destruction of the English Civil War period was not carried out by or on the orders of Cromwell.
The work of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century would have dismissed the false statue of Cromwell.
The extraordinary statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hammock Thornecroft is a 19th-century example of thought and part of a historical character that many people consider worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people see Cromwell as the protector of Parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case, against the pressure of the monarchy  which is now the opinion of few but was the opinion of many in the 19th century.
But whether this is a completely accurate picture of the time is part of the ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century shaped the future development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known character who has represented a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and memory".
The killer pig slaughtered the Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found near a pig stable in the market of Liopanshui in southern China's Guizhou province with a ruptured artery and blood clots, a South China Morning Post report said on Sunday.
A pig herder prepares to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm in Shining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He and his brother Fupato came to the market on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs from nearby Yunnan province, the report said.
The next morning, his brother Fufu found him dead and found the door of a pigsty next door open.
He said that there was a large male pig in Istanbul with blood on his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked and killed the farmer, the report said.
"My uncle's legs were both bloody and injured", said Fupato, whose last name is identified as Wu, quoted by Guyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man is not the man or his brother.
A market manager told Evening News that police were collecting supplies at the scene and the pig was isolated so that it could not attack anyone else.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating the amount of compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been instances of attacks on pigs before.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig kept a Welsh farmer in his tractor until his wife came and threatened to drive the pig away.
A Manitoba farmer told CBC News after eating a pig from an Oregon farmer in 2012 that pigs are not usually aggressive but can act as a "trigger or stimulant" to get a taste of blood.
"They're just being mean.
They bite small, very keen animals but they don't try to hurt anyone.
But you have to understand them well enough", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosas will cause heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, the strength of the hurricane is weakening as it moves over cool waters of the northern coastal region of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, the Rosas will cause heavy rainfall causing flooding in northern Mexico and southwestern United States.
Today, at 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday morning, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with a speed of 85 miles per hour, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
I'm supposed to be heading north for Rosa on Sunday.
In this direction, a system in the Pacific Ocean is beginning to take shape and is moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. On Monday, the Rosa Bahá will hit the California peninsula as a seasonal storm, pushing deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Due to the Rosas, up to 10 inches of rain will fall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
The deep tropical moisture then combines with the system to precipitate heavy rainfall across the southwest for the coming days.
Local flash flooding from 1 to 4 inches of rain or flash flooding, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert
Due to the deep tropical humidity, rainfall rates can range from 2 to 3 inches per hour in various places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
There is a possibility of 2 to 4 inches of rainfall in parts of the southwest, especially in most areas of Arizona.
The dispersion of tropical rainfall is likely to cause flash flooding and very rapid deterioration of the situation.
It would be very foolish to walk in the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall can make the canyons dangerous rivers and strong winds with dust will result from thunderstorms.
Due to the flooding system, heavy rainfall will occur locally in parts of the coastal areas of Southern California.
Rainfall can reach up to half an inch, which can cause small debris to flow through the streets.
This will be the first rainfall in the region during the rainy season.
There may be some scattered tropical rainfall in Arizona from Sunday night and Monday morning, then rainfall will increase to spread throughout the area from Monday night to Tuesday.
The heavy rainfall will reach Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Several extreme temperature changes may be observed in various parts of the United States in October as the Arctic cools, but tropical temperatures remain quite warm.
This sometimes results in dramatic changes in temperature within a short distance.
Sunday was a prime example of the dramatic change in temperature in the central United States.
Temperature differences between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, were estimated at about 20 degrees.
The remaining summer heat will try to rise and spread again in the coming days.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience warmer temperatures in early October, with temperatures in the southern plains to the northeastern regions expected to be in the 80s.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests that temperatures in the eastern United States are likely to be above average in the first half of October.
Brett Cavana's audition has been seen by over 20 million people.
The heady testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanagh and alleged sexual assault of Christine Blazey Ford, allegedly in the 1980s, was seen by more than 20 million viewers on six television networks on Thursday.
In this direction, political controversy continues, with broadcasters regularly suspending the show due to last minute surprise on Friday: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that gives the FBI a week to investigate allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanagh touched her body while drunk at a high school party and tried to uncloth her clothes.
Kavanah said in an emotional testimony that he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as stated in Nielsen's report, watched the Friday event.
The company was averaging viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks, which broadcast the event, were not immediately available in viewership, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble with the number of people sitting in her office.
The crowd for the event was equal to the football play-offs or Academy Awards.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion of the show's hosts strongly supported Kavanagh's nomination, has the highest viewership of any network broadcasting the day-long hearing, averaging 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS saw 3.1 million, NBC saw 2.94 million, MSNBC saw 2.89 million and CNN saw 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was still low after the hearing.
Flack was the central character in today's play.
After the Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanagh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, as he took an elevator to reach the Judiciary Committee hearing and protesters shouted at him.
He stood up for a few minutes in front of the protesters, which CNN broadcast live.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think Kavanagh is telling the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have power, when many women are helpless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator was closed said he had more to say at the committee hearing.
Later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to move Kavanagh's nomination to a full Senate vote, all cable and broadcast networks broadcast live.
But Flack said he would vote on the condition that the FBI investigate charges against the nominee next week, which were being requested by the Democratic minority.
The conversation with fellow Democrat Senator Chris Coon, who was behind Flack's approval, has had a partial impact.
After talking to Kuhn, Flake spoke to several other senators and reached his conclusion.
Flack's decision was staggering, as it was clear that the Republicans had no vote to approve the Cavana except through an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanagh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics on Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing a political game with Britain's future and neglecting the nation's interests.
On 29 September 2018, Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview, his former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson continued to criticize May's so-called Checker's plan for Brexit, saying that the UK and EU's proposals to collect each other's revenues were "totally unreasonable".
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrest Dayton Simpson suspected of killing LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities have released video of the riot between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said the glasses contained Simpson's DNA, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed to shooting and killing Wade.
According to The Advocate, his bail was set at $350,000.
The Office of the MENA Investigator in the East Baton Rouge area released an initial report on Friday citing gunshot wounds to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The department is providing credits to the Louisiana State Police's fugitive suspect capture task force, State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and area residents to assist in investigations that result in the arrest of the accused.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Aleva thanked the area's law enforcement agency for its "unrelenting efforts and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father played basketball for Wayne and LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was saddened and devastated by Wade's death.
"It's always a concern", said Wade.
Volcanic eruptions in Mexico City
The eruption of the Popocatepellet volcano has reached the southern region of the capital of Mexico.
After the volcano's face increased in activity and gas and combustion emissions reached 183 on the 24-hour scale, the National Disaster Management Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano.
The Centre was monitoring multiple rumblings and tremors.
The images posted on social media showed the car's windshields were lit up in areas like ZochiMilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in September 2017 that rocked Mexico, just 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital.
The volcano, known as Don Goioi, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in clashes between right-wing police and pro-independence protesters as they joined opposition protesters to celebrate the first year of voting for Catalonia's independence.
A group of masked separatist police intercepted them by throwing eggs, and colored powder, creating black clouds on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, the police used stickers to stop the fighting.
For hours, the liberals will not forget, they will not forgive", protestors chanted, facing unity supporters who chanted "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries as a result of the protests, local media reported.
Tensions have been building in the independence-minded region since Madrid outlawed the October 1 Catalan referendum celebrated by separatists.
The lion's share of voters voted for independence, although the number of voters was low as the majority of the population opposed to isolation boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in deadly clashes with police last year, which prevented voting during the region's elections.
Liberals were on the streets all night on Friday to block the demonstration in favour of the National Police.
The protesters continued their activities but were forced to go through different streets.
Narcisse Termis, 68, an electrical worker who joined his wife in the separatist protests, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's independence.
"Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents tear in the eyes of joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite winning important but narrow provincial elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum where many of their well-known leaders are awaiting trial for their voluntary exile or detention for their role in the referendum and subsequent Declaration of Independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joanne Puig, who is recording the protest in support of the police on his phone, said politicians from both sides had sparked the clash.
He added, "The uncertainty is getting worse by the day".
O'Reill Juncaras, one of the Catalan leaders who was not in pre-trial jail on Saturday, announced late last year that he would contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"The best way to prevent the repression and persecution of democratic values by the Spanish government is to stand for the European elections", he said.

Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after being hit repeatedly by a car in a London home.
The incident occurred at 19:30 Bangladesh time on Thursday in Ballynagar Krishnet.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blimings says the gates and buildings were damaged.
At some point, the car may be targeted by a crossbow and thrown.
Manger's goal was a 1-0 win for Livingston against Rangers.
Dolly Meng's first goal for Livingston ensured the win.
The promotion stunned Livingston Rangers, giving Steven Gerrard his second 18-game defeat as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menger's goal created the gap as Gary Holt's side tied the Hevernians for second.
As a result, Gerard's team went undefeated in the premiership this season and will face the top-ranked Hearts eight points ahead of them on Sunday.
Earlier, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, who have already extended their unbeaten run in the division to six games, have yet to get a taste of defeat after head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, took over.
Livingston missed several chances against their unwieldy opponent.
Holt's team should have been ahead long before the goal was scored, as their aggressive attitude created all sorts of problems for the Rangers!
Scott Robinson moved forward with the defense separation but failed to bring his efforts to fruition, while Alan Lithgow could only drive his efforts wide past and after sliding to meet Craig Hallett's header.
The hosts were allowed to play in front of the Rangers, knowing that guests could be in trouble on set.
And that's the key to the goal.
The Rangers conceded a free-kick and opened the Livingston goal account. Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to set up Menga, who scored from the centre of the box in a touchdown.
At this point, the Rangers were dominated by the ball but they viewed the host's defense as inferior and goalkeeper Liam Kelly spent most of the time in the E-League.
The series continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos pushed a shot at Kelly.
Scott Pittman was defeated at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and won another set piece for Livingston from Lithgow Wide.
Crosses were continually coming to Livingston Boxes and were also gradually being cleared, although two penalty claims - the alternative Glenn Middleton - were dismissed after Hallett's challenge and for handball.
The incredible achievement of Livingston.
Tony McCarney at the BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont Arena
An outstanding performance and results for Livingston.
For some, they were great, they continued to exceed everyone's expectations in their upward pace.
Their style of play and players have rarely changed since returning to the top tier, but the credit goes to Holt for the way he has joined the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halcott was exceptional, building a well-organized defense, and keeping Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the sidelines at all times.
Although the Rangers were less motivated.
They're as good as they were under Gerard.
They had a final ball short - only once they had opened the reception - and this was a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed welcome in Cologne.
The situation was very happy as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin on Saturday for Brexit.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which was held to repair relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to inaugurate a massive new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police have set up security to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - were heard condemning Erdogan's policies and his decision to welcome him to Germany.
This conflict demonstration proves that a visitor is praised as a hero by the German Turks and condemned as a dictator by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:00 am Bangladesh time.
The driver stopped the car and the cyclist was treated for emergency medical treatment, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred again months after another bicycle accident on Children's Street, which is located 1 mile from the crash site on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said that officials are working to identify the man and inform his next relatives.
Bus blocks have been placed and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were wounded in the disorder.
Six prison officers were injured in the chaos at the high security male prison, the Prison Office said.
At around 9.30am on Sunday, the unrest erupted and continues at HMP Long Latrine in Orchestershire.
Tornado officers, experts in dealing with the chaos, have been brought in, including eight prisoners who belong to a branch.
Officers were treated for facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lawn.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that convicts will be held under the law and will spend longer behind bars".
HMP Long Laundry has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison administrator had been hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, right-wing officers were called to prison to deal with a serious disorder where workers were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricanes Rosas are threatening sudden flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (although drought-prone areas may benefit).
Tropical low pressure hits Arizona is rare, but this is exactly what appears to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa moves with its remaining strength through the southwestern desert with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday in cities in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, including southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, in western Arizona.
The fast is expected to reach Phoenix directly on Tuesday and rainfall by late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!"
Katrina (1967) which was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border. "
The latest National Hurricane Center model predicts 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with a discrete range of up to 6 inches in Mogulon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rockies and Great Basin, have a chance of roughly 1 to 2 inches of rain, which can be as high as 4 inches in isolated amounts.
Roosa rainfall can be a blessing to those who are at risk of flooding as the areas are drought-prone
Although flooding is a serious concern, it is likely to be of some benefit as the southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the US Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second highest category, according to Weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will cause landslides across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still a powerful hurricane, is hitting its peak at 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, moving 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and 12 miles per hour north.
The storm is losing strength as it faces cold waters in the Pacific Ocean.
So, on Monday afternoon or evening, the force of a tropical storm is expected to make landfall in Mexico.
Heavy rainfall could occur across parts of Mexico, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to northwestern Sonora, up to 10 inches of rainfall is expected"
The Rosa will then travel north through Mexico as the tropical low pressures, before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning and entering southern Utah Tuesday night via Arizona.
"The main threat expected from the Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern deserts of the United States", according to the National Hurricane Center.
The rainfall could lead to deadly flash floods and destructive currents in the desert and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four attempted murderers arrested.
A 16-year-old boy was found stabbed to death after being arrested in Somerset on suspicion of attempted murder of three teenagers and a 20-year-old man.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4pm on Saturday, Bangladesh time.
He was taken to hospital where he is now in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Redstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officers have asked anyone who may have mobile phone footage to come forward.
Trump says Kavanagh is a victim of Democratic Party "cruelty, anger"
"A vote for Judge Cavana is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's brutal and outrageous tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanagh has been the victim of "democratic cruelty, anger" throughout his nomination process.
Kavanagh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she was sexually abused by her as a teenager decades ago.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his allegations.
The President said Saturday that "the American people saw the extraordinary and virtuous and courageous nature of Kavanaugh that day".
To West Virginia supporters, he said that a vote for Jazz Kavanagh would be a vote to protect a lawyer with the most successful legal personality of our time, a public service starring record".
Speaking of the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president bluntly acknowledged Kavanagh's nomination.
"It's only five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I am not participating, but I am really participating.
"That's why I'm always striving to fight for the great candidates".
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "prevent and deter".
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Kavana's nomination is not expected to be held after Friday, a senior associate of the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and toll increases are being witnessed.
At least 384 people have been killed and many drowned in a massive tsunami and earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Thousands of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Pallu on Friday when a six-meter (18-foot) high wave broke through the beach in the evening, pushing many people to their deaths and destroying everything along the way".
The tsunami came after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"Yesterday people were continuing their activities on the beach even when there was a tsunami threat and those who did not immediately run and became its victims", said Sutopo Purwo, spokesman for Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB, at a briefing in Nagorno-Karabakh.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything above the ground", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami travelled at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) in the open sea before hitting shore.
Some people climbed trees to survive the tsunami, and they survived,
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres of Palur.
Sky images released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges reversed and collapsed, and a mosque submerged in water.
Aftershots continue to roam the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in areas with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the capacity of the World War II atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could further increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "widespread", saying that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
Some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building, he added, with 540 injured and 29 missing.
The casualties and damage could be greater in the region of Dangal, 300 kilometres (190 mi) north of the coastline of Palu, near the epicentre, Nugroho said.
The communication system "was completely crippled without any information", said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, "the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers were heading to the affected area".
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse".
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves came as soon as the warning was issued.
The footage of the scandal shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of the building screaming at people on the lower street to sound tsunami warnings.
Within minutes a murky stream of water hit the shore and destroyed buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately prove the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages that disrupted communication around the port and made rescue efforts difficult for authorities.
The military has started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, rescuers are now in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport in Nagar has been reopened for relief efforts only and will be closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the shelters of the Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's terrible.
According to Mr Doseb, while the World Organization staff were safely travelling from Donggala to the city of Palo, where the staff were taking shelter in their office yard, they saw images of the destruction on the way.
Dozeba added that they saw many houses destroyed there.
That's a shame.
Even when the relief teams started disaster relief efforts, some complained that foreign aid workers were being hindered from travelling to Pallu with great skill.
Under Indonesian law, foreign funding, food supplies and personnel can only come when a disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
But it hasn't been announced yet.
Auliya Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said: "It is still a provincial disaster.
"If the government says yes, it is a national disaster, then we can start international aid but we have not yet received such an announcement.
Friends and family of the missing are also expecting a miracle on the second night of the tsunami in Palua on Friday that will bring their search to an end after a devastating chapter in the natural disaster.
A young boy was removed from the nursery on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been lying next to her mother's body after two days of stone washing.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Jendon Subandono trained two paragliders from the Asian Games, who are now missing, which took place in Indonesia earlier this month.
Mr. Mendaghi also mentioned that the students who were trapped at the Roya Roya Hotel were his students.
He also said that as a pioneer in the field of paragliding, I am responsible for my own emotions.
Mr. Jendon recalled how the news of the collapse of the Roya Roya Hotel spread to the paragliding community hours later, he was shocked to spread it to the Palo competitors via WhatsApp messages who attended a festival on the beach.
But his message was not read.
He said, "That means the message hasn't been sent".
Thieves stole $26,750 while refilling money into the ATM machine at Live's Newport.
A news release from the Newport Police Department said that thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning while employees of the Brink's were storing money in the ATM.
The driver was vacating ATM money at the entertainment complex and was ready to pay more, Detective Dennis McCarthy told a news conference.
While he was working, another Brink's ran behind a worker and ran away with a bag of cash that was ready to be handed over.
According to the press release, witnesses saw many suspects flee, but police have not yet identified the number of those involved.
If anyone can identify these individuals, they are being asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
This rapper changed his name, yes.
Rapper Kane West is changing his name.
Announcing the change, he tweeted on Saturday: "Officially known as Cain West".
West, 41, was also known as Yee for a long time and used the name as his nickname.
The name change was announced ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she hoped to release her new album Yandy.
The show's producer said he is replacing singer Ariana Grande who cancelled the show for emotional reasons.
West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him, as well as a shortened form of his current professional name.
West said earlier this year, in a discussion with radio host Big Boy about the album's title, "I believe that Ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means You".
So I am you, I am ours, that's us.
Cain says that, meaning the only person, yes reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
This album is a great reflection of who we are".
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known variously as Puff Daddy, PDD or DD, but this year he announced Love and Brothers Love as the preferred names.
A former partner of West, J-G, has worked with Hyphen, without Hyphen and Capital.
The AMLO of Mexico has vowed not to use military force against civilians.
President-elect Andrés Manuel Lopez of Mexico has vowed not to use military force against civilians on the 50th anniversary of the bloody atrocities against students.
Lopez pledged at the Plaza de Tallateleco in Abrazo on Saturday not to use military force to torture the people of Mexico. "
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful protest that killed 300 people as left-wing student movements in Latin America established themselves.
Lopez apologized to young Mexicans in Abraado for the monthly tuition and support for building more public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal associations.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research spending, said AI researcher and investor Kai-fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement comes from various parts of the government, the United States has announced that the United States has a formal strategic shortfall in artificial intelligence.
China already launched its new plan last year: to become the number one AI innovator by 2030.
Li further said that "double budgeting will be a good start to AI research where most countries are far behind and we are looking for the next steps to advance AI".
The double funding could double the chances of the United States acquiring the next big artificial intelligence, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "All Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" is published this month, is the CEO of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a innovation venture that has invested in Face++, one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest ranked American player, and he was the executive of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged the technology competition of the previous US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, to determine the next step.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
China is not removing academic leaders; corporations are removing them", Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited intellectuals from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help further boost U.S. AI efforts.
"I think the green card should be automatically offered to PhDs in artificial intelligence", he said.
China's State Council released its next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions, such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies, to spend money on US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is low, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center, which involves industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a selection committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DRPA announced $2 billion in investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As NSF, it currently invests over $100 million per year in research into artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the US law seeking to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen progress in months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to rename it the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece that blocked attempts to gain membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has vetoed the entry of NATO and the European Union, representing a claim to its territory by its northern neighbor.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and expressed doubts about whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required to legitimize a referendum on banning campaigns.
The referendum ballot question was: "You stand for NATO and EU membership with the recognition of the treaty with Greece".
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, have argued for the price of EU and NATO membership for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely in the shadow of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us", said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijeva Skopje.
While not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will comply with the results of the vote by taking decisions.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name.
The State Election Commission said that there were no reports of irregularities after 1 pm.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the 2016 National Parliament elections, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I'm here to vote because of my children, we have a place in Europe", said Jose Tejevsky, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Jaev, his wife Zorika and son Dusko have voted in favour of the name change in Macedonia, which will pave the way for Macedonia's accession to NATO and the European Union in the current referendum on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage in front of the Parliament in Skopje and pulled chairs in front of tents set up for those who rejected the referendum.
"We support NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the service door", Kavadarkov said.
" We are a poor country, but we have a status.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian alliance".
Prime Minister Jaiv said that NATO membership will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where unemployment rate is above 20 per cent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the European Union and NATO", Jaev said after giving his ballot.
He said that a "yes" result would be our "confirmation of the future".
A poll by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research published last Monday showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum below the turnout required.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote yes.
A referendum must have more than 50 percent of the vote to be successful.
The referendum failure will represent the first serious blow to the policies of the pro-Western government since it took power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero enters the whole of Brighton's defence for the goal.
Brighton defence won 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, by defeating Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling.
Aguero made it extra easy to see his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass in midfield early in the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before going on the open field.
Aguiero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He turned a defender before overtaking several others on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he pushed a pass to the left, which found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to shoot the right side of the net by defeating Brighton defender Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his foot", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that moment".
However, Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage of the Premier League fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area in that game.
He sent the ball to Leroy Sen through a beautiful path on the left side.
Sen took a few touches before taking Sterling to the remote post.
Sky Blues tapped the ball into the net just before the forward boundary was exceeded.
City will face Hafenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neker-Arena in Szynchem, Germany.
Sherry wants to play in the game against the Rockies.
There was little reason to force the Nationals to start another one after being removed from the playoff debate.
However, the ever-competitive sherzer expects to take the mound against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, only if the playoffs have an impact on the Rockies, who have a one-game lead against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the NL West.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night to earn at least a wild card spot, but they are still looking to win their First Division title.
"While we're not playing for anything, at least we can get our feet on the ground with the Denver fans knowing the weather and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any points I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but it is rumored that they may let the Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and pitched to his usual rest on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the President sharply referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanagh.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
It's a big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running, so I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to use whatever means necessary to recover power, you see this humility, this cruelty.
They don't care who they're hitting, who they have to push to get power and control, they just want power and control, we don't give it to them".
He said Democrats are on a mission to "prevent and deter".
"And you've seen that for the past four days", he said, calling Democrats "angry and mean and mean and untrustworthy".
He named Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who received loud tickling from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Did you leak the documents?
Oh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer a liberal organisation.
People who say what they say in their mouths are not tolerated here.
When the staff of the local party momentum voted for me, it was no surprise.
Because I was the last Labour MP on the list to tell you that your speaking nature is not welcome here.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was convicted of disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on issues of Europe and national security and similar issues, Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said "We want to make meetings inclusive and productive".
In my eight years as a local Labour MP, this is the first time that a Friday night GC meeting has been exactly like this.
But sadly, today, this is not the tune of that meeting and the promise of "compassionate, gentle" politics has long been forgotten, if it really ever began.
It has increasingly become apparent that dissent is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged as to whether it is acceptable for the party leadership.
It started right after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I thought I shared the same political views with began to expect me to take a U-turn and take a position I would not agree to under any circumstances - be it national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly  And even though I don't care what I say - there are social media scandals calling for my removal, criticism of the Centre's politics, and I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are also political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a storm of discrimination or racist abuse every day but never feel ashamed.
The most frustrating aspect of this era of politics is how the disparity of the galaxy has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a liberal organization and every "disbelief" vote or election rule change narrows the party.
For the past two years, I've been advised by many to keep my head down, not talk so much, and to "be okay".
But I'm not in politics to do that.
When I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, and we were spurred by the Thatcher government's negligence that literally destroyed our vast school classrooms, I tried to provide the necessary government services to those who needed them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was in any way confused about my policy position and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who promoted the movement on Friday, I can only say that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and our public services, I cannot understand the desire to waste my time and energy in showing loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But I really have no message for the Nottingham moment, it's for my constituencies, whether Labour or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of instability or political activism will stop me from doing what I believe is in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is an MP for Nottingham East
Earnings 38-17 Melrose: Rise to the top of uncut earnings
Two attempts late may narrow the final result gap somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayres deserved to win the day's remarkably entertaining Tenant Premiership match.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team out of 10.
In the end, it was their best defense, just as good as their ability to take chances, which helped the welcoming team win and was the legitimate reason coach Peter Murphy was happy.
"We've been tested in every game so far and we're still undefeated, so I'm happy".
Robin Christy of Melrose said: "We have to give credit to the Irish, they have used their potential better than we have".
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, transformed by Frazier's Climo, pushed Ayr forward, however, a yellow card from Scottish player Rory Hughes, which expelled him for the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose a majority and Jason Bagot an unsuccessful attempt.
Climo increased the lead on penalties by scoring a goal, just before, in the halftime, he scored a single try to make it 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed by Bagot, narrowed the gap to five points.
The game was then delayed for a long time due to a serious injury to Ruarih Noth, who was stretched and after the game resumed, Ayur went further through the efforts of Stafford McDowell, who transformed Climo.
Iron's incumbent captain Blair McPherson then received the yellow card and after a spell of intense pressure again, Melrose's Bruce Calvin tried to punish Iron's extra player.
Although the welcoming men returned immediately, and when Strawan Hutchinson saw the yellow card for dealing with the climax without the ball, McPherson pulled a touchdown from the penalty line and moved forward to the revenue pool.
Again, Klymo transformed, Kyle Rowe when David Armstrong's box kicked a kick and Flanker sent Gregor Henry out on the fifth try at home side.

Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of losing to Chile in a bloody 19th century wealth conflict is still clear, just as the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
These expectations are probably the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has that momentum, unity and pure consciousness and of course we expect results with a positive outlook", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadailla.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICC rule on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will support Bolivia's claim that - after decades of decent negotiations - Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign outlet to Bolivia at sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who will face a controversial run for re-election next year - also relies heavily on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's favor - and if so, that will change little.
The Netherlands-based United Nations agency has no authority to grant territory to Chile and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The ICJ's ruling, which comes just six months after the final argument heard, indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Jeret, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of moving the Bolivian cause further, it may have gone backwards in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the entry into the sea", Zeret said.
Morales' anti-war speech has raised any excess wishes from Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk for a while, but it will be very difficult to discuss afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia from The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzi, denied the court's decision was unusually speedy.
Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity for a new era in relations with Chile" and "an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadaila also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the maritime issue as a political pillar.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
"The rally is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past".
North Korea has said that nuclear disarmament will not come until the United States trusts.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that if Washington cannot be trusted, its nation will not first disarm nuclear weapons.
He addressed the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep the pledge made by rival leaders at a summit in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on track to reopen a stalled nuclear diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore after more than three months.
Re said it was a "pipe dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration of the end of the Korean War would put North Korea at risk.
Washington warns that Pyongyang may agree to the declaration without a significant disarmament process first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal, which the country sees as probably the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge headwear on the way to a high street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, you don't have to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brown unveiled a line of oversized headgear for their SS19 collection at the runway that shocked the Paris Fashion Week style set.
This summer, the most absurd hat is on Instagram and these designers have sent their eye-catching puzzle to Catawba.
One of Valentino's creations was an over-the-top badge hat that was decorated with a wings-like width of a cane that covered the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories include decorative turmeric, a wizard's hat and even an anise - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Brown also released a selection of bizarre masks -- just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks were sewn up and looked more like Hannibal lecturers than they were funny.
One creation resembles a full-scale scuba diving gear with snorkels and goggles, the other looks like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you keep up the big fashion statement -- you're in luck.
Style observers predict that huge bonnets can go to the nearest high street.
The outsourced hats are competing for La Bombà, a two-foot-wide wooden hat seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratzhakovsky.
The cult label behind the highly unreasonable hat that has been spreading through social media has sent another big creation to Catwalk - a straw beach bag that is about the size of a model in swimsuit.
The burnt orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringing and with a white leather handle on top, was one of the items in Jacques's La Rivera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told Female: 'I hope that next summer big hats and beach bags will arrive on the High Street - it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories as the designer has made such an impact.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have maintained a track record of academic excellence, and this continues the results of another outstanding test in 2018, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of service to their students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as global citizens.
As an educational field that can design and implement a particular school curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be popular and preferred in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
If you talk to her in her own language, it goes to her heart".
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent test, we can see that the languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rates among independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages have obtained higher grades.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools shows that 72 percent of students achieved higher grades in Mandarin while 72 percent studied German, 69 percent studied French and 63 percent studied Spanish.
This proves that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now being taught, as subject choice, in private school curricula and elsewhere in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of employers blamed their language skills for the reason they were struggling to fill the vacancy.
So more and more, language skills are becoming essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world for more potential job opportunities that require language.
Whatever career they choose, if they learn a second language, they will have a real benefit in the future with their lifelong skills gained.
Being able to communicate directly with people from abroad automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were not fluent in any foreign language during conversation, and French was the only language of the decennial-percent, at 15 per cent.
This is why it is important for today's children to invest in language education.
Multilingualism, especially in developing economies, will provide better opportunities for children to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages they teach.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while by 2020 others will be teaching languages considered most important to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be many languages to choose from in individual schools, including expert teaching staff.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed no matter what the future holds.
In the global business environment, there is no denying that languages play an important role in the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will provide this choice, diversity and encouragement for young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans are almost done watching LeBron James start his first tour for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's Precision Open against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the number of minutes he will play has not yet been determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game precision schedule.
"I don't need precision games to be ready at this stage of my career", he said.
During Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has been raising the alarm of a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
This is the first of five scheduled rallies in the next week, with Trump stopping in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a confirmation vote to fill the Supreme Court vacancy in his favor, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm election, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after voting in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight, and how are you watching online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally below via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week the hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanagh, who has been sidelined by an expected Senate confirmation vote during an FBI investigation over allegations of sexual abuse.
However, the initial goal of opening these rallies is to help Republicans gain some momentum in the face of the November election.
Thus, President Trump's campaign says that the purpose of the five rallies next week is to encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to preserve and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, Reuters reported.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that as we enter the busy campaign season, the president will travel to as many states as possible", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, declining to reveal the name.
Scheduled for the Wesbenco Arena at Wheeling, today's rally "may bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and bring coverage from the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
This Saturday, Trump visited West Virginia for the second time since last month, the state he won with more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls, ahead of the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should try to encourage him further in the election", said Simon Heather, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show hunger for hope in a single match on Sunday
The Ryder Cup was needed just before Saturday afternoon after three one-way sessions.
The pendulum roll of the moment is a completely innovative sporting concept but it is what players really believe in, and the most in such competitions.
So where are they gonna tell you the momentum now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we have a little momentum now", Jordan Speeth said for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead with 12 games remaining.
As Speith said, the Americans feel they have some help along the way and they can be encouraged by a lot, especially the form of Speith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and both scored four to three points.
Speith was brutal from start to finish and leads from the front.
As his round progressed, the celebration screams became louder, as he and Thomas made the crucial step to take the full four-point square match, two points behind after scoring two.
The one that got them the game at 15 got the same scream, which tells you a lot about his belief that the American team is not out of it.
"You really have to go deeper and think about your match", said Speith.
All these players have it now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The players who scored more points in the last two days than Speed and Thomas were just Francisco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup's story of injustice.
The strange but adorable pair of Europeans are four to four and they can't go wrong.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who didn't shoot a buggy on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided the buggy on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning at 9 pm.
That run, and the way their energy was flowing to and from this enthusiastic crowd, seemed to be the players they lost on Sunday, and there was no other player as popular as possible to seal a European victory without Fleetwood or the Millinery as the sun sets at Le Golf National.
It's better if both are in different holes at the same time.
Although the European glory is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had some problems for morning fox Sergio Garcia while paired up with Alex Naren.
The first nine threw a bogie and two doubles Spaniards and Swedes into a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, though, there's no one to get you out of your hole.
It's very interesting to see the interaction between the pair of ties up close and personal because of the tips they give, the tips they don't give, and the tactics that can change immediately.
Europe has played relatively well as a team so far and took an important lead on the final day, but this Forsam session further proved that Team USA has a hunger for battle that something, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will take a healthy advantage of the 10-6 lead against the United States from Saturday's Forthball and Forthsum matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Encouraged pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari have now taken their tally to four points at the Golf National, leading them to two wins over the two-time defending champions Tiger Woods.
Thomas Zorn's European side, bidding to recover the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltin, beat the defective American side in the morning Foursquare to win the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance to Forsam after winning two games, but they failed to fill the gap.
Jim Furrick's team needed eight points from 12 single games on Sunday to recover the trophy.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to score four points in a row and he and Molinari, together, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points from the first four matches after an extraordinary weekend.
Woods and Patrick Reed were knocked out in the foreball and they then imprisoned a losing Woods and American rookie Bryson DeCambue to beat Superbly by a stronger 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled himself out of two games on Saturday, occasionally picked up a storm of brilliance but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in the Foreball and Foressam, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting for the morning foreplay, returned to Forsam partner Henrik Stenson with 2-1 defeats of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepker - world No. 1 and No. 3.
A lovely, windy day on the southwest side of Paris, although Europe was not on its own.
Three-time major winners Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won the Forball with a strong 2-1 victory over Spain's John Ram and Ian Polter and came back to beat Polter and Rory McCallroy 4-3 on the opening two holes at the Força.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history have a team come back from a four-point deficit in a single innings, although as of now, only a draw is needed to recover the trophy for Furrick's side.
After being second best for two days, however, Sunday's counterattack seems to have outdone them.
North Korea has said that it will not unilaterally disarm without 'no' faith.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the existing sanctions deepened distrust of the United States and that there was no chance for the country to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
At the World Organization's annual general meeting, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea took significant positive steps last year to commit to halting nuclear and missile tests, demolishing its nuclear laboratory, and not increasing the spread of nuclear technology and nuclear weapons.
"But we have not seen any similar reaction in the United States", he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, we will have no confidence in our national security, and there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm in such a situation".
While Re described North Korea's allegations against Washington's "armed" nuclear disarmament system that would be rewarded for North Korea's slow action, his remarks proved significant because he did not unilaterally dismiss nuclear disarmament altogether, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri cited a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim "committed to working on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula" and when Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States has emphasized 'disarmament-first' and has increasingly imposed sanctions to comply with its objectives, even "against declaring an end to the war", said Lee.
"The idea that restrictions can roll us to the ground is a mere dream for those who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the continuing ban is deepening our distrust".
Ri has not commented on the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president presented to the United Nations earlier this week.
The Minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: "If this issue of disarmament had been South Korea, not the United States, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been so unstable".
Still, the tone of Lee's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US mainland with North Korean rockets while "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "Rocket Man" suicidal.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament action, but said there was still much work to be done and the sanctions would remain in place until North Korea disarmed.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no deadline for it, he said, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months to do it - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the actions taken by the UN Security Council
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Americans on Thursday that the Security Council's "Safety Council sanctions must be effectively continued until we fully realize the final verified disarmament".
The Security Council has unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Riy at the UN General Assembly Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second conference.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He said when he left Pyongyang in July that some progress had been made, only hours before North Korea denounced him for "claiming like a goon!"
North Korea, at a meeting with Moon this month, promised to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States "takes appropriate action".
He said that the "consecutive steps" Kim told him were looking for were the security guarantees Trump had given to Singapore and the security guarantees he was moving toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on getting enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year is providing a way for all its graduates to get more sleep to cope with the growing culture of caffeinated, night-time waking up".
One academic has discovered that students at the number one university in the world are often confused about the very basic issues of how to take care of themselves.
The course was created by Charles Ceciller, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on how sleep deprivation has affected the education sector.
And at the end of it a young woman came to me and said, Why am I so called to come to my senior year?
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me, 'he was telling the Telegraph.
The course, which was launched for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits help students in academic and athletic performance as well as the need to improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's Department of Healthcare, said the university decided to launch the course after students were severely sleep deprived this week.
The one-hour course has a few related tasks.
One section features images of a dormitory room, where students will learn about the effects of caffeine and lighting by clicking on coffee cups, screens, coaches and books, and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and realize the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants were asked how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know it won't change students' behaviour immediately
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking, too, just as you do about your decision to smoke", Professor Ceciller added.
He said the culture of being awake at night is still alive, and he said that sleep deprivation is a growing problem due to the increasing pressure on modern technology and students.
Ensuring you get enough quality sleep should be a student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even sleep deprivation makes the brain hungry, constantly starving.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology in California who helped design the course for Professor Sijillar, also took a class last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to take a campus-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, he will ask all postgraduate students to complete such a study programme before joining competitive institutions.
Professor Sizilar recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed and when to wake up, and should be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can destroy your circadian rhythms, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: The defeat of the Mongers by Geraard.
The Rangers saw another away loss to Steven Gerrard's random team, losing 1-0 to Livingston on the goal of Dolly Menger.
The Ibrox team looked to another win after a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerard a second defeat as manager in 18 games, taking him eight points away from the Hearts, who were leading the Ladbrokes in the premiership.
Menga was hit seven minutes before halftime but the disappointing Rangers lineup never got their tack.
Rangers have now slipped down to sixth place, Livingston have climbed to third place and have overtaken Hibernian in goal difference.
And it could be more of a problem for the Rangers because a thing thrown from the end of the road had to be treated for a head injury by Lineman Calum Spence.
Gerard made eight changes to the team which led Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was with the same Levi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and should be proud of the way his well-equipped team had stunned the opponent to the point of blocking his breath.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston did more with their balls.
Manger sent Scott Pittman to the first-ever goal of Alan McGregor, who should have scored in just two minutes, but the midfielder missed his big opportunity.
Keegan got a long free-kick captain of the Jacobs, Craig Halcott, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to hit the ball in the back post.
The Rangers regained control but had more hope than their confidence in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that his penalty should have been found at quarter-hour due to his and Steven Lales' conflict but referee Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers could only target two shots on the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly Lasana suffered minor problems from the head of Culiac and the OV Azaria shots.
Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been against the flow of the game, but no one can deny that they are the only ones who are entitled to their design game.
Once again the Rangers failed to handle Jacobs' deep set-piece.
Scott Orfield did not respond to the Dean Gallagher's Scott Robinson's ball being slated, he froze his head to pick the manga for the general finish.
Gerard took action on the break to replace Cooley with Ryan Kent and the change was to take effect almost immediately as the winger was in Morrells, but the extraordinary Kelly drove him off the line to the block.
However, Livingston began playing the exact kind of game that visitors enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halcott sending long balls after long balls.
Holt's team could have taken their lead to the final stage, but McGregor stopped to ruin Jacobs' efforts before Lithgow headed out of the corner.
Thompson once again turned down a claim by Glen Middleton, the Rangers' replacement, to take a late penalty after a falling out with Jacobs.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter.
And now a page of our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually became known as the Geiger counter.
Since then a core of science, Geiger Counter has also become a core of pop culture, with the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly potential Cowpock scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can hear the effects of the atomic radiation in the minerals".
Evans: "It's a lot of noise, is it?"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But his eponymous discovery still survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify malignant cells.
The new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to detect and kill malignant cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the lab.
They can then 'see' a protein common to many cancers and then re-enter.
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different levels of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches her immune system to detect malignant cells, has watched her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the lab so they can "see" a common protein in many cancers called HER2, and then re-entering the cells.
"Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine", said Jay Burzfsky, a professor at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "causes the growth of a variety of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers", explains Professor Berzowski.
Removing immune cells from patients and "teaching them how to target cancer cells" has also worked similarly to treating leukemia.
Kanye West joined the pro-Trump debate at the SNL wearing a MAGA hat
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio after a long-running performance during Saturday Night Live where he praised US President Donald Trump for saying he would still be in his dreams in 2020.
After performing her third song of the night, Ghost Town, where she wore a Make America Great cap, she denounced the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"A lot of times when I talk to a white person, they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's racist!'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, " he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon where the Hollywood star joked about Brett Cavana's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual abuse claims by Christine Blazy Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's parody was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to make fun of West with the post, though.
In addition, West complained to the audience that she had problems with her headgear in the backstage.
"They beat me up in the backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out wearing a hat.'
They beat me up!
And then they said I was in a sinking place, according to the Washington Examiner's source.
West added: "Would you like to see the place?" saying that he would read his "Superman Cap", because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Then try with love".
His comments were echoed by the audience at least twice and embarrassed by the SNL cast members, Variety reported, where a person told the publication that: "There was a pinfalling silence throughout the studio".
West was brought in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
He confused many with his performance of the song "West I Love It" which was decorated like a bottle of pearls.
West has received support from Candace Turner, head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing up against the thugs".
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was who he was and he was absolutely great".
"But I chose not to reward anyone (for buying his music or clothing or supporting his" art ") who embraces and spreads ideals that are harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we, too, " he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now "officially known as Kanye West".
D He is not the first artist to change his name and Ddy, who is known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Ddy, has followed in his footsteps.
Another contemporary rapper, Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder by stabbing at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after being stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Balihacamore.
Asami is scheduled to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harington attacked toxic masculinity or toxic masculinity.
Kit Harrington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's offensive medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor, referring to the stereotype of Macho, said that playing such a role on screen meant giving young boys the idea that they had to be tough to get respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believes 'something went wrong' and questions how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at the age of 31, admits that she feels overwhelmed by the issue.
'I personally feel very strongly, right now - where are we wrong about masculinity?' he said.
'What did we teach men when they were growing up that we are now facing this problem?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the growth of toxic musculature due to its hyper-masculine characters.
He added: 'What is simple and what are we learning?
What is it that is taught on TV and on the streets that boys think they must follow in order to be men?
I think that's really one of the big questions of this time - how do we change that?
Because clearly there is something wrong with the young people.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be doing a Game of Thrones prequel or sequel when the series is renewed next summer, saying he has "finished the life of the battlefield and the horse".
From November, Kit will star in the remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which follows a film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on this show, so it's my future family that gave me my life
Rose played the girlfriend of Egret, the character of Kit, John Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported a 14% increase in new cases.
China has announced a 14 percent increase in HIV and AIDS cases.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials said.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases were due to sexually transmitted infections, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly to different parts of China for blood transfusion.
However, the number of HIV infections has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing to 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still considered to be rampant.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men marry women later.
Many diseases are transmitted through inadequate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the GOP senators' data leaks, 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denied on Saturday that a member of her staff posted personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on the Wikipedia page of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat firmly claimed that these claims were being promoted by "ultra-right wing" scholars and websites.
"Lies, lies and more hateful lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The release of the information reportedly includes the addresses and phone numbers of the homes of U.S. Senators, Senator Lyndsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both Uttars.
The information was released online on Thursday, an unknown person posted on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanagh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanagh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Scholar and Redstat reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was associated with the "Water's" office and disclosed information about which members of the Water's staff, Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and a complete lie", Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations - was not responsible for the leak in any way.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a complete lie".
Waters' statement quickly garnered criticism online from many, including former White House press secretary Ari Flister.
"This denial is angry", Flischer wrote.
"It says he has no inclination to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they do not get angry.
They will not argue.
They should not question the complainant's intent.
They must be calm and calm".
Flischer compared Waters's response to Democrats' criticism of the judge, who was considered very angry by critics during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is electing to remove Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's big if it's true", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about the fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he continued, "and are legally held accountable for all their actions, destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again review - Weak Rowan Atkinson spy
It is now traditional to see the Brexit significance in any new film, including British thrillers, and it seems to apply to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began with Johnny English in 2003 and returned to Johnny English Reborn life in 2011.
Clearly, how much waste we are, is this self-defeating thing going to be a new export opportunity?
At any rate, the pop-eyed, rubber-oriented disabled Johnny English has a second chance at creating new things - more than anything else, his name suggests that he is a comprehensive comic creation designed for the film world of languages other than English.
He is certainly a silly secret agent who is somewhat tied up despite the bizarre tendencies of smooth jumper, a dash of Mr Bean and a dolp of chalk contributed a note to the Sharia's Fire theme tune at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
He is primarily based on Traveller and the International Mystery Man Atkinson starred in the once-forgotten Barclaysard TV commercials, spreading disorder in science.
There's a great moment or two in this latest Jay-Outs.
I liked to see Johnny English approach a helicopter wearing medieval armor, with rotor blades hanging from a small helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical humor is showing, but the humor has been felt to be rather low-quality and oddly exaggerated, especially since 2007 and "Serious" film brands like Mission Impossible now confidently offer humor as an ingredient.
The joke seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's bizarre accidents are not as innovative and focused on Ben's persona as Atkinson's silent film jokes.
The topic of the yearly foundation is that Great Britain has been in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker broke into Britain's top-secret spy web network to expose the identities of all British agents in the field, to discourage the agent in charge - a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last confidence of a prime minister who is already suffering from a complete depression of anti-politics, a rambunctious and boundless personality: Emma Thompson has done her best with this half-Theresa-May character, but there is not much to work on the script.
His intelligence advisers told him that every active spy has been compromised, so he needs to get someone out of retirement.
And that means to fool Johnny English, who is now employed as a school teacher in some animal institutions, but teaches out of the box how to be a clown: Here are some good jokes, because English offers a rock-type academy of espionage here.
English returns to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with his former long-suffering psychic boy, played by Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a water-hockey-stick role in which Vicky Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who made a serious mistake in Her Majesty's Secret Service, return to action and face off against Olga Kurelenko's moronic woman Ophelia Bolitova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling for the magic of a charismatic billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinner Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacy.
English and Bow begin their long-distance high-zinc quirks: under the guise of waiters, they set fire to a flash French restaurant; they push Voltaire on a luxury boat and start a brawl of smuggling themselves; and English Voltaire uses virtual reality headset to try and introduce himself to the interior of the house to create a pure homage.
All stops are definitely drawn for the last order, but as mystical and entertaining as it is, there is quite a bit of a children's TV feel to the whole thing.
Very moderate staff.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour denies it is planning to work four days a week for Britain but will get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a master plan that sees Britons working four days a week - but getting paid for five days.
The group wants the owners of the company to share the savings made by an extra day off of employees through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, according to the report.
It will see employees enjoy three days off - but still bring home the same salary.
The source said the idea would be 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and the plan is to move the country for the workers.
The Trades Union Congress has approved a shift to a four-day week as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'This will not happen overnight but four days of work is an aspiration that fits with the team's approach to maintaining balance in the economy for the workers as well as the overall industrial capacity of the team.'
The Green Party, not the first to support such a concept, promised them four days of work during their 2017 general election campaign.
The aspiration is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole, though.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day working day is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to express his vision for a socialist revolution in economics.
Mr. McDonnell said he is determined to return power to utilities from 'unidentified directors' and 'beneficiaries'.
The Shadow Chancellor's plan means that current shareholders of water companies may not get their full share back because the Labour government may pay some 'backs' for the wrongdoing it perceives.
He also confirmed plans to create an employee-owned and incorporated ownership fund to provide equity to 10 per cent of employees of private sector companies, with an annual dividend of $500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, tell 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh can change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanagh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and the bureau's investigations have raised questions about whether any Republican senator could turn their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelly asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his counterpart from South Carolina.
"Well, of course", Kennedy said.
"I told you to go to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanagh.
I called him after the incident, and the charges came out, and I said, 'Did you do this?'
He was determined, unambiguous".
Graham's vote, however, seems unchanged.
"My mind has been made up about Brett Kavanagh and a big, pretty important complaint will be needed to change it", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blessy Ford.
"And they could not verify the name of whom he had spoken".
It's 36 years old.
I can't see any change".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be the New York City's Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a great line-up of star performances and an equally impressive mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will not only see thousands of people walking around the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but also raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Described in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an internationally promoted group that actively promotes the goal of eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people struggling.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you're not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concertgoers had to work on multiple tasks or "activities" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in 12 years of achieving its goals?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the real step to urging people to take action, or is it another case of so-called "clicktivism" - where people think they're making a real difference by signing online applications or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, moving towards various goals.
It says that these steps have helped world leaders to announce a majority of the $37 billion pledges and policies that will affect the lives of 2.2 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 pledges and announcements that have been made since its inception, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or funded.
The team estimates that the hedge fund has so far directly affected about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges include Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and implementor partnership committed to "helping children reach their full potential", and Global Citizen's pledge to provide 35 million to Rwanda to end the county's malnutrition problem after receiving more than 4,700 tweets.
"With the help of UK governments, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a landmark in history", Tracy Ullman, Ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the public during a Power Concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 steps in the United States to improve the nutrition of mothers and babies, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutritional intervention.
One of the most frequently asked questions on its website is "What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It's going to be a long and hard road - sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-racist movement before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Money will be among the performers at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Farnes and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy to "block" Russia's energy exports to disrupt them - Home Secretary
Washington could take shelter from its navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian fuel from entering Middle Eastern countries, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington examiner.
Jinq alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria - notably, where it is operating at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new fuel markets.
"I believe that their position in the Middle East is because they want to broker power like Eastern Europe, the southern hub of Europe", he said.
And according to the officials, there are ways and means to deal with it.
He said that the US Navy has the ability to keep the sea free and block their fuel if necessary to ensure that it does not enter the market.
Zinka was speaking to attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that identifies energy as "the voice of consumers" in the United States.
He was comparing the use of Washington to Russia and Iran in the real world.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to benefit from and replace less fuel", he said, referring to Russia's "holding pace" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The Trump administration's announcement comes at a time when it is aiming to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe at a much cheaper rate for European consumers instead of Russia.
As a result, US President Donald Trump, including Trump administration officials, is himself trying to get Germany out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says is now in the hands of Moscow in Berlin".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline, is ready to move to 110 billion cubic meters - a fully financed project.
The Kremlin's argument is that Washington's strong opposition to the project is nothing more than financial and that it is an example of uneven competition.
"In my belief, we agree that energy cannot be used as a tool for pressure and consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after an interview with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has received a negative response from Germany, reaffirming its commitment to the project.
Germany's industry leader, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"After the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) Dietter Kamf said that we have a major problem with any third country interference in our energy supply.
Elizabeth Warren will "look ahead" to the 2020 presidential nomination, said the Massachusetts senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "check out" the presidential candidates for the post after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he is in the race at Holloway Hall, a town in Holloway, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our collapsed government and that includes women in top positions", she told The Hill.
"I will be steadily declining to run for president after November 6".
Speaking at the Warren Town Hall against President Donald Trump, Trump said he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has faced criticism from Trump and Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
"Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote", Warren said in a tweet on Friday.
A poll published on Thursday found that most of Warren's own voters do not think he should run in the 2020 election.
A survey by the Suffolk University Center for Political Research/Boston Globe found that "possibly" 25 percent of Massachusetts voters say they should not run for senator.
Thirty percent supported the fight.
The poll found that former Governor Deval Patrick's support for the fight was higher, with 38 percent supporting a potential fight and 48 percent not.
Other high-profile Democratic names potentially discussed in the 2020 election race include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden will make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin quoted Trac Palin's PTSD at a rally for Donald Trump
Track Paulin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested on Monday night for domestic violence.
"She told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, "What my own son is going through, what he's going through, what he's going through, I understand other families who understand the consequences of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are going through".
Paulin called his arrest "the elephant in the room", and said of his son and other war veterans, "They came back a little changed, they came back strong, they came back to think whether the army and air force and other members of the armed forces had respect for their colleagues who gave to the country?"
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday and, according to police spokesman Dan Bennett, was charged with domestic violence, possession of a weapon and possession of drugs against a woman.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting legal challenges against new U.S. policies that refuse to provide shelter to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
In support of an asylum seeker challenging the policy, representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief in court in Washington on Friday, NBC News reported.
The full name of Badi in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, was not disclosed.
He said that his associates "and his violent gang member boys" mocked him, but U.S. officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Attorneys for the states supporting Grace cite El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as examples of countries heavily affected by gang and domestic violence, from which large numbers of asylum seekers come to the United States.
The new American Asylum Policy reverses the Immigration Appeals Board's 2014 decision to allow unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Carl Ressin of the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
The Friend-of-the-Court brief states that "under this federal law, all refugee applications should be judged on specific facts and circumstances and such a ban violates the basic purpose".
In the statement, the attorneys further argued that the policy of denial of entry to immigrants is hurting the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and they "provide the necessary labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop sheltering victims of domestic violence and gang violence fleeing in June.
"Those who have been forced to leave their country due to persecution or fear of leaving their country because of their ethnicity, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion can be granted asylum", Sessions said in its policy statement on June 11.
Refugees never mean the solution to all the problems - even all the deadly problems - that people face every day around the world.
The number of dead and the dead in the rescue efforts doubled.
The situation for the survivors was terrible.
"It was very worrying", said Reza Kusuma, 35, in a shelter in the city of Palu, to comfort her fiery child.
Every minute, bodies are being brought to the ambulance.
There is no clean water.
Residents were seen returning to their own destroyed homes in an attempt to find and save everything found in the frozen water.
Hundreds of people were injured and crowds were flooding hospitals damaged by 7.5 magnitude tremors.
Some of the injured, including the broken back and shoulder, have been taken out of the Pallu Army Hospital, under treatment due to the subsequent tremors.
He cried out about the tremendous earthquake he felt while in a five-story hotel room with his wife and daughter.
I didn't have time to save myself.
I was stuck in the middle of a broken wall, I think, and Harris told a media representative that they were in town for a wedding.
I hear my wife's cry for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my kids.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of "propaganda propaganda"
A week after a Chinese government newspaper published a four-page advert to the US daily citing the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the Chinese US ambassador accused the American press of using it to carry out targeted campaigns against Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited the paid supplement of Iowa's largest Chinese daily, the Des Moines Register, and accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, which China denied.
Trump's allegation is that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election, which US officials told Reuters was a new attempt by Washington to pressure China.
It is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war, which has led to increased tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that early in the trade war, China's retaliatory tariffs were designed to hurt exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party.
Chinese US ambassador and former longtime governor of Iowa, Terry Branstad, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, Branstad said that China "has now doubled that barbarity with targeted advertising in our own free press".
"By advertising this propaganda on the Des Mines Register for payment, the Chinese government is taking unethical advantage of America's history of free speech and free press", Bransstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the newsstands along the streets of Beijing you will find limited opposition voices and you will not see the true reflection of the Chinese people's opinions about China's worrying economic path, because the media here is pointing to the hand of the Communist Party of China", he wrote.
He also said that his writing refused to be printed by a major Chinese newspaper, although he did not name the paper.
Republicans want to keep women voters away from the Kavanaugh debate ahead of the midterm, analysts warn
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has sided with many leading Republicans over multiple allegations of sexual abuse, and analysts have warned that they will see a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The sentiment has grown sharply and it is apparent that most Republicans are already looking to go public with their vote.
"They can't come back at all", Grant Riar, professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Rihar said there was doubt that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute pressure for an FBI investigation would calm angry voters.
According to the Washington DC newspaper, Karen Jean-Pierre, senior adviser to the Progressive Movement group and national women's spokeswoman, said Friday, "Women don't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow and November".
As the Judiciary Committee's decision to move the Republicans ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blazy Ford's testimony, protesters chanted "November is Coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate Hallway on Friday morning.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be the past", said Stu Rothenberg, a pro-democracy political analyst.
People say there is already too much; it is true.
But it could be more so, especially among the booming suburban female voters and young voters aged 18 to 29, who don't vote often because they don't like the president".
Even before Ford testified publicly about allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that if Republicans moved forward with approval, there might be adverse repercussions.
"It's become a complicated issue for the GOP", former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele told NBC News earlier last week.
"It's not just a matter of whether the committee vote or the final vote or the Kafanf will be held back, but how the Republicans have taken the matter and how they have handled it", said Guy Cecil, director of the Poorities USA group, which supports Democrats in voting, to the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat uncertain about who to trust in the context of the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the latter being heavily criticized.
A new survey by Yugov found that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
It also found that 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied when he testified, and only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, in the case, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Judicial Committee last week by taking an oath that he was abused by Kavanaugh in Nashua at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that Supreme Court nominee showed her sex at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web has planned to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that will build a solid Open Source platform for Berners-Lee.
Solid gives users the right to choose where their data will be stored and which information will be allowed to people's access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's real goal is "world dominance".
"We need to do it now", he said of the start-up.
This is a historic moment.
The app allows everyone to create a P&D or "personal online data store" using Solid technology.
This can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all in the same browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data stores is that it depends entirely on the user - who has access to what kind of information.
The company has named it Data-driven Personal Empowerment.
According to the company CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt will help bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to everyone to get solid.
The company currently consists of a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a team of contracted on-staff developers and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on Inrapt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "are not talking about whether to launch any complete changes with Facebook and Google where all their business models will be completely changed overnight".
We don't ask for their permission.
In a post to the media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrapt's "purpose is to provide commercial fuel and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee radically changed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as a powerful voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this coming age of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Celebration of the Victorian Cross Clergy of the First World War
The centenary of the city of Adi is celebrated by the only Church of England priest to have won the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a soldier.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 during the invasion of Bellinghill and Lehankott.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and he never knew he had received the highest British military honour.
Two of his grandchildren unveiled his memorial at a march in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "very significant" that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through heavy fog and heavy shots of field and machine gun fire during the Peronne Canal de Saint-Quentin.
He then ran into the firing line and led the line with the utmost courage, only singing a field song and scattering three enemies.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, says his grandfather's work is something I could never do and that is a great honor.
He and his brother Dr. James Van Koochkawas later donated the flowers, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he was honoured to take part in the parade and said that the support of so many people was a show of true heroism.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch 206 Ballot, but instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine you've been up all night watching a great BellTrader 206 and the main event hasn't been shown.
The original bill from San Jose had 13 fights, including six, and was shown live all night on Channel 5 in the UK.
In the early morning, as Gerard Moussaci and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, coverage changed to Peppa Pig to shock UK viewers.
They were up until dawn, especially for this fight, so some people got angry.
A fan on Twitter described changing children's cartoons as "a dirty joke".
"It is not appropriate to show such a show at 6am according to official rules, so they were forced to change the cartoons for children", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator, in response to a question about the broadcast.
Daddy the Pig, yeah.
Scott Cocker, president of Bellator, said he would work on scheduling the UK's future visitors.
"In the time of the revolution, we may be able to solve this", said Coker.
"But now it's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we can't do this until Sunday, their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was switched, there were a lot of messages coming in and they weren't very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it might be a technical flaw.
But no, it was government business.
I promise you, it won't happen next time.
We're going to cut it down to five fights instead of six, as we usually do, in an effort to give fans more, and the opposite is true.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daly has suffered from sexual dysfunction.
Olympic diver Tom Daly says that growing up he suffered from sexual inferiority - but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't realize until he went to secondary school that "everyone is not like me".
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about gay rights in giving others hope.
She also said that after the birth of her child, her thoughts about Olympic victory decreased.
The long-running show's regular presenter, Christie Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a social outcast at Laverne's first event, Daly said she felt inferior to everyone else because "the boys and girls were not socially acceptable".
He said: "To this day, the feeling of being small and feeling different has remained the reality that has given me the strength and determination to succeed.
She said she wanted to prove herself as something so that when everyone knew about her sexuality, everyone would not be disappointed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and has used her presence to appeal to more countries to recognise homosexuality at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said he opened his mouth because he felt lucky to live in public without complications and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion talks about falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - who surprised me.
Daly married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than her, and said the age gap was no problem.
"When you're going through so much at such a young age - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he says it was hard to find anyone of his age who had seen such a breakthrough in life.
The couple gave birth to a son, Robert Ray Black-Delli, in June, and Delli said his "whole outlook" has changed.
He said that if you asked me last year, I would say, 'I have to win a gold medal.'
To tell you the truth, there is something bigger than an Olympic gold medal.
Rabi is my Olympic gold medal.
Her son is named after her father Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daly said her father never admitted that she was dying and she eventually asked if their tickets for London 2012 had been confirmed - because she wanted to stay in the front row.
I never said you'd be gone to the front row, either, she said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and until he took his last breath and died and I didn't admit that he wasn't invincible", she said.
The following year, Daly participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
He said that this was my life's dream - to dive in the Olympics in front of my audience.
It also inspired her first song choice - Heider Small's Proud - which resonated with her in preparation for the Olympics and which still thunders at her.
Desert Island Disc on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15pm.
The off-forming Mickelson will sit on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to get back in shape if he doesn't want to make it an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who has played a record 12 times in the biennial event, had to sit on the bench at Saturday's Formball and Forsam instead of captain Jim Furrick.
Instead of being in the center of the hustle, which he was in the USA game, the five-time major winner spent his days working as a cheerleader and busy refining his game on the range.
Not always comfortable among drivers at the peak of their careers, this 48-year-old tight-launched course is not suitable for the National Golf Course, where long rafts often cause long shots to get in trouble.
And if the course itself isn't bad enough, Mickelson, in Game 9, is facing British Open champion Francisco Molinari, who has won all four of his games this week paired with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who are four points down in the first 12 singles matches, can get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could prove important.
Furyk showed confidence in him, even though he didn't have much to say.
He has fully understood his role today, put his hand on my shoulder and said he is ready for tomorrow.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's given a lot to this team in the past and this week.
I probably never imagined he'd play two games.
I was hoping for more, but that's what happened, and that's how we thought we'd move on.
He wants to get on the field, just like everyone else.
In Sunday's match, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldor's record for most Ryder Cup matches.
This could end Ryder Cup career which is not even close to breaking his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven half-centuries to his name, although Furrick said his presence cheered the team up.
He's also a funny, funny, intelligent, likes to mess with people, like being in the team room and a great guy, he said.
I think the new players enjoyed playing with him, even this week, which is great to watch.
He gives more than just play.
Europe Captain Thomas Lightning knows that even the big lead could disappear.
Thomas Bajrón, the European captain, knows from experience that a single drop on the final day of the Ryder Cup with a big lead can create an uncomfortable situation.
Dan made his debut in a match in Valderama in 1997, where the team led by Savi Balleros scored five points against the Americans, but only managed to cross the finish line at 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"Remember to yourself that we had a big lead in Badrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and we had a big lead in Badrama, where we won, but in nominal terms", said Bjorn, who can be seen in the picture, "being ahead of the Le Golf National in class 5-3 and 10-6 on Friday and yesterday".
History will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over yet.
Get off with all the excitement tomorrow.
Get on the field and do the right thing.
Not until the points are on board.
We have a goal, and that's to try and win a trophy, and that's where we'll have a bird's eye view.
I've always said that I look at the 12 players on my team, but we're also very aware of who's on the other side -- the best players in the world.
He added that he was pleased with the performance of our players on the tough golf course.
Tomorrow is a different fight.
Tomorrow, personal performance comes out, and it's a different thing.
It's great to be with a partner when everything is going well, but when you're alone on the field, your abilities as a golfer are fully tested.
This message needs to reach all players, that tomorrow everyone should give their best.
Now, you have to leave your partner and go ahead and get the best of them.
In contrast to the lightning, opponent Jim Furrick will be watching to see if players play better as a team than they did individually, except for Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas, who scored three of their four points.
As part of the team that lost the "Miracle on Medina" in Europe and won the Brooklyn Final, Furyk himself has experienced the tragic turning point in the last days.
Asked how captain Ben Crenshaw had cheered up his players before landing on the final day of 1999, he said, "I remember every word".
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you're gonna want to get rid of the fast start like Brooklyn and Medina.
When the game is tilted to one side, there is a lot of pressure on the midfield matches.
We'll line up accordingly and get the boys down the way we thought we were going to, actually, we want to do some magic tomorrow.
With Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in charge of leading Thomas's fight against the Europeans, he will face Rory McElroy in the opening match.
"I have arranged the group in this order, because I think it will cover everything", said Bjorn about his singles selection.
The new German warship is once again suspended.
According to local media reports, the newest German Navy with this group was to be launched in 2014 to replace the previous Cold War-era warship, but due to faulty systems and snowballing costs, it will not be until at least the following year.
The launch of the first vessel of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate, the "Rhineland-Fulge", has been postponed until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman quoted by Die Zeit newspaper as saying.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project has been hampered by post-delivery issues.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
It is reported that they will have powerful armoured, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include long maintenance periods - it will be possible to deploy new frigates away from the country's ports for a maximum of two years.
However, the continued delay means that the state-of-the-art warships - which are supposed to help Germany demonstrate its strength abroad - will become obsolete by the time they sink, reports Die Jate.
The unfortunate F125 frigate came to the fore last year, when the German Navy officially refused to launch the ship and sent it back to the Bloem and Vos shipyards in Hamburg.
This is the first time a ship has been returned to the shipbuilder by the Navy after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cite several important "software and hardware flaws" that would render the ship useless in battle.
The software's flaws are particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - which is half the manpower of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was overweight which would reduce its performance and impede the Navy's future upgrade additions.
The 7,000-tonne "Rhineland-Fall" is thought to be twice the weight of the same class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
From the initial level of £2.2 billion, it has risen to a staggering £3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problematic new frigates have become more important in the recent wake of warnings of a shrinking German navy.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was "flowing a suitable ship for the Motoyne".
The official said the problem has grown over time, as no replacement ships have been brought from the old ones that were cancelled.
He regretted that no Baden-Württemberg-class vessels were able to join the Navy.
Sheena to get the National Trust's hold on the secret lives of bats
A new study is being conducted at an estate in the Scottish Highlands to find out how bats use the land to find food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of this unique flying mammal and help with future conservation activities.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will also be investigating common and soprano pipicerels and the Dobbinton butterflies at Inverario Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important locations around the area to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct ongoing surveys using portable detectors.
The expert will analyze the sound of all the recordings to determine the vibration of the frog's call and to know what species are doing.
A landscape map and report will be created to create detailed land-scale images of their behaviour.
Rob Dhan, NTS's nature conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as grassland creation and how to protect forest for bats and other related species.
In the last century, the number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly.
They are at risk for building and development work that damages their sleeping and living spaces.
There may also be dangers from wind turbines and light, such as from some chemicals in flypapers and building materials, as well as from attacks by pet cats.
The frog is not blind.
However, their ears are more effective at catching prey than their eyes because of their habit of hunting at night.
They use an advanced resonance-positioning technique to identify hazards and obstacles in flight paths.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, has emphasized the importance of Bhadur.
They have 10 trained specialists who conduct regular surveys, visit sleeping areas and sometimes rescue operations.
The company has also set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Thrive Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate Manager David Thompson said the estate is a good area for bats.
"There is a good area for bats in Thrive", he said.
There are old buildings, many ancient trees and all the good houses.
But much more is still unknown about bats, so what we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive".
He stressed the importance of knowing the presence of bats before maintaining the property, as this could cause the destruction of 400 female and baby bats by unintentional destruction of a single maternal family habitat, and wipe out entire local numbers of bats.
It is illegal to kill, harass or disturb protected animals or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Farrell, the Scottish officer of the Butterfly Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and we know nothing about how many species live.
Ronaldo denies rape charges and lawyers are about to sue the German newspaper
The rape allegations against her were falsely reported and people wanted to build their reputation with her name.
Her lawyers are ready to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who brought the allegation to the public.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward were accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorca in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was accused of paying him $375,000 for keeping quiet about the incident, the Der Spiegel report said on Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million followers on Instagram live video hours after the claim came to light, Ronaldo, 33, described the report as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is is what is what is what is what is what is what is what is what is what is what is what is what is what is what
What they said today is false news, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told in front of the camera.
They want to make a name for themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but it's part of life.
I am a happy man and everything is going well. The player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have described as "an unsatisfactory report that is suspicious of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player must seek compensation for "moral damage to the seriousness of the violation which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times".
The alleged incident occurred in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player's house after meeting at a nightclub, where he sexually assaulted her.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo had begged Anunay after the incident and told him that he was disappointed by "99 percent" of "good guys", "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that was consensual.
Mayorga further claimed that she went to the police and was photographed in hospital, but later agreed to settle out of court, as she was "scared of reprisal and feared being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she now wants to bring the matter up again, as she is mentally devastated by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was in the midst of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the offence and joined Italy's famous club Juventus on a $100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing its position as a carmaker
Commerce Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would forever regret losing its position as the world's first car maker after Brexit.
He also said it was "disconcerting" that the UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily shut down production at their factory in Barnstone near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker says that a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses due to border delays.
Barnstone's factory - which makes Toyota Oris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, about 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, our factory could shut down production", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director at Barnstone.
Other UK automakers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without any agreement on how cross-border trade will be handled.
For example, BMW said they would close their mini plant in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concern that carmakers are raising is the risk of a no-deal Brexit in the supply chain.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for the ordered vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border that could lead to delays in parts delivery and a parts crisis, like the trade court.
The company said that it is not possible to keep inventory worth more than a day at the Toyota Derbyshire plant, which could lead to production shutdown.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is well-crafted to avoid such checks at the border.
"We need a deal. We want to make the best deal that not only sustains success, but also enables us to enjoy the potential for future improvement", he told BBC Radio 4 today.
"It is not just Toyota, but other manufacturers, that prove that it is vital to continue the successful supply chain".
Toyota cannot say how long production will be shut down, but they warn that the excess costs will reduce the factory's competitiveness in the long run and could result in many job losses.
Peter Suvalris, a 24-year-old unit union organizer at Barnstone, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these things go away, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We need to have a clear and credible plan for future relations with the EU".
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed further.
The White House said on Sunday that a high-level meeting with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanf, Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, could be "pushed back another week" between Tanapoden and Trump.
Rosstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, special counsel investigating Russian election interference, Trump's ally and the connection between Russia and the president's possible interference in the trial.
The debate over whether Trump will dismiss the deputy attorney general and question Mueller's freedom has been raging in Washington for the past few months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed using a secret microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosstein denied the report.
However, he reportedly visited the White House last Monday in the context of reports that he was about to resign.
Instead of announcing a meeting with Trump on Thursday, Trump was at the UN office in New York at the time.
Trump said he would "not like to fire Rosstein", but the meeting was postponed to avoid a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee, after both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blazy Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosstein, he said: "There is no date set, it could be this week, it could be postponed for another week for all other current Supreme Court issues.
But let's show it, and I always want to tell the media.
Some journalists will object to the statement, and Sanders has not held any press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Director Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that not keeping a briefing was not about annoying reporters, although he said: "I don't deny that they do show people".
He then suggested direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The current president has more question and answer sessions than any previous president", he said, without citing any evidence.
"But if the media gets a chance to question the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me", Sanders said.
We're trying very hard to do this, and you've seen us do it for the past few weeks, and instead of a press briefing, we're going to have a direct conversation with the president of the United States".
Trump regularly takes questions when leaving the White House or attending opening sessions or press conferences with distinguished guests.
A single press conference is rare.
In New York this week, the president probably showed why unplanned acts and occasional bizarre appearances can be made in front of a press team.
Health Minister NHS writes a letter to EU workers in Scotland out of fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health expressed his gratitude to the EU staff working at NHS Scotland and expressed their desire to stay in post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to cover the settled status application costs for EU citizens to work in the country's government services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, talks on Brexit have been ongoing between the UK and the EU, which are expected to result this fall.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible no-deal situation.
I know you're all going through a very stressful time for this.
Therefore, I would like to remind you once again that I value the contributions of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and beyond have brought valuable experience and expertise that has strengthened and improved healthcare and benefited patients and our communities.
Scotland is your own country and we want you to stay here.
Christian Barcambi has emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee Mike Organ said Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Barcombie had emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
Read said he got on the sidelines and got a little crazy.
The trainers and medical staff gave OCRMBY oxygen along the sideline and later brought her back for further testing.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Cromby was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are yet known about the type/type of injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine the time of the injury.
A second-year redshirt student after transferring from Illinois is playing his first season with Acrombie, Tennessee State.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total to 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay more stamp duty when they buy new property in the UK under the Tory scheme and the extra money will be spent on homeless assistance.
This move will mitigate the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The stamp duty increase will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects this to generate more than £120 million a year in income support for the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay more stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - and the extra money will be spent on homeless assistance, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will mitigate the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters while targeting higher incomes and providing more affordable housing.
The stamp duty increase will apply to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will go to the government to help the homeless.
The surcharge - which is higher than the current stamp duty, which was imposed on second homes and rental homes two years ago - may be more than 3%.
The Treasury expects this to increase revenue to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of London's newly built properties are bought by residents outside the UK, which has led to rising prices and complicating the situation for first-time home buyers.
Most of the country's elite regions - especially the capital - are becoming unfamiliar cities with a large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy came weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty reduction to help young people buy their first home.
She accused large construction companies of raising property prices without using land and called for the abolition of affordable housing quotas to address Britain's "housing problem".
Mr. Corbin announced an interesting series of housing reform proposals, including the elimination of rent controls and "no-fault" evictions.
He wants to give the council more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - which is that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means rebuilding the market for broken homes.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be right that foreign and non-UK-based private companies will buy property as easily as hardworking British residents.
Many people have a dream of home ownership that is far from true, and the problem of homelessness remains a reality.
Jack Ross: My ultimate dream is to take over Scotland.
Sunderland boss Jack Ross has said his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland's manager one day.
The 42-year-old Scottish national, currently enjoying the challenge of recovering the North East club, who are now third in League One, three points behind the first team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, bringing St. Maryn back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for the country as a player.
I got a B-cap and so far", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father as a child and it always pulled me back.
If I manage the club successfully, this is the only chance I can have.
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Elders, Martin O'Neill, Roy Cain, Gus Poyet and Paolo De Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not disappointed by rejecting offers from established names in major clubs like Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The criterion for success for me at this point is 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities at this club it is undoubtedly eligible for the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I'll probably see myself as a success if I can get the club back there".
Ross's manager's life is currently just three years old, after 15 months as assistant boss and coaching staff at Heart at Dumberton.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier and convert St Mirren from relegation gate to championship title winner the following season.
And Ross said he's more comfortable here than he was playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton academically.
He recalled taking over the role of Aloe, saying, "It was probably a real milestone".
"I really believed that management was more important to me than sports.
It sounds weird because I did the right thing, I made a pretty good living out of it, and I enjoyed some success.
But the game is tough.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel the same way about the workload, but management seems right.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I do, and it's the most comfortable thing in my entire adult life on my own skin".

The survey says Saturday at 5:30 p.m. is the best time for a pint.
Summer heat waves have increased crowds in smoking pubs across Britain, but have put pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars sales rose 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant fundraising declined 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's business consultancy firm, who compiled the figures, said: "England's unexpectedly long participation in the World Cup and the endless sunshine mean that the trend will continue in July as it did last June, when pub sales rose 2.8 per cent and restaurant sales fell.
The decline in the restaurant business by 1.8 percent in June worsened in July.
The main pubs and bars have done very well so far and the sales of the restaurants have been as bad.
Food main pubs are also suffering from heat disruption, but they are not as low as restaurants.
Looks like people are just out for a drink.
All pubs and bars sold drinks up 6.6 percent this month, with food sales down three percent".
Paul Newman of RSM, a retirement and hospitality analyst, said: "The trend towards the end of April is still ongoing.
The impact of weather and large social or sporting events on sales in the outdoor market is greatest.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups will be in a difficult situation, but this 4.8 percent drop in sales each year will be particularly painful.
Food can't come at a bad time for major operators from a long and hot summer, and time will tell if the August mild weather will bring some relief.
In July, total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent, reflecting declining sales in brand roll-outs.
The UK pub, bar and restaurant sector's Koffer Pitch Tracker Industry Sales Monitor collected and analyzed performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 million, and is an established industry standard.
One in five children have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The survey revealed that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the increase in fake Insta pages
The news fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - is creating a social media account hidden from adults.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed that the account has been growing rapidly, according to the fake Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they have a transparent "main" account to show their parents, with hidden features.
A mother who visited her 13-year-old daughter's hidden site noticed that a teenager was calling others to "rape me".
A study by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18 year olds have two profiles, half of whom admitted to confidential accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is thought-provoking that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers cannot find".
Elith Doyle will be the Voice for Athletes on the Scottish Athletic Board
At the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body, Elith Doyle has been elected as a member of the Scottish Athletics Board as an Executive Director.
Doyle described the move as a great opportunity for sports managers to benefit from his extensive experience internationally over the past decade, as Scotland's most successful track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beatty.
"Elijah is highly respected throughout the Scottish, UK and world athletics communities and we are confident that bringing her to the Athletics Board of Scotland will benefit her immensely", said Betti.
"I am keen to be a voice for athletes and I am confident that I can really help Scotland's sport and move it forward", Doyle said.
The American, who won four Olympic golds in 1996 in Atlanta, including the 200m and 400m and is now a regular BBC scholar, has stopped walking after a transient ischemic attack.
She tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor said time will tell how much I'll be able to recover.
It was a very hard job, but now I'm completely healthy, I've learned to walk again and I'm starting to exercise again!
Thank you for the inspiring message!
The Internet is more bipartisan than the mother and cow in breast pump advertising
A breast pump company has split the Internet's view with an ad that compares mothers to baby cows.
To mark the launch of what is being called "the world's first silent-wearing breast pump", consumer technology company LV has released a funny music video ad to showcase the freedom the new pump gives modern mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing to a song in a crowded cow hut, with lyrics that say: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail". And "If no one sees, these are not animal tails, these are my breasts".
The chorus continues: "Pump and pump, I feed the children, I pump and pump, I milk my girlfriends".
However, the ad, which was released on the company's Facebook page, has generated controversy online.
The video received mixed reviews from viewers with 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Many said it highlighted the "terror" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cattle in advertising for this product is a very bad decision.
To produce milk, they need to get pregnant and give birth like us, the difference being that their babies are stolen from them within a few days of birth", one wrote.
The LV breast pump is beautifully placed inside a nursing bra (LV/M)
Another commented: "It's obviously a disappointment for both mother and child.
But why not use them in breast pumps for mothers who keep their babies close to them?
Another said: "It's very uncomfortable advertising.
Others stood by the ad, with one woman admitting that she liked the song "pleasantly".
I think this is a great idea.
If I fed the baby, I'd have one.
I feel like a cow when I pump.
The ad sounds a little crazy, but I took it well.
It's an innovative product, someone wrote.
Another commented: "It's a juicy ad aimed at mothers who pump (often at their workplace or toilet) and think of themselves as 'cowboys.'
This ad does not praise or criticize the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women say they all danced with the pump hidden in their bra.
The ad is based on the idea that many women feel like cows when they pump their breasts.
Although the LV pump is completely silent, it has no wires or tubes and fits nicely into the nursing bracket, which allows women the freedom to walk, hold babies and even go outside during pumping.
Anna Balerin, Mother's partner and ECD says: "The LV pump is a revolutionary product that should be started with courage and excitement.
Drawing a parallel picture of the female and the dairy cow, we wanted to highlight the challenges of breast pumping and all of its challenges, in an entertaining and relevant way, to express the incredible sense of release that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that LV pumps have made headlines.

Hundreds of migrant children are quietly taken to a tent camp near the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, as the Trump administration's stringent rules and policies make it harder to keep children with their sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors fear they will lose their chances of staying in the country by claiming undocumented immigrants and children themselves.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints, and the information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albanes, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor orphans.
The agency later reported that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal history.
"About 80 percent of the sponsors' family members are in the country illegally and a large proportion are convicted criminals.
So we're still looking for them, " said Nester Albenz.
In an effort to bring the children back to society more quickly, officials introduced some new rules including having to appear in court within a month of their detention, which was 60 days before, the shelter staff said.
Many will not appear in person to the immigration judge for legal status during their case via video conference call.
Those deemed unfit for relief will be displaced quickly.
According to the shelter staff and reports released from the system in recent months, the longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent incidents or attempted escape.
Supporters say that these concerns are more acute in large centres like Tornillo, where children are more concerned, more likely to be ignored, because of their size.
They also said that if children are not mentally prepared or given enough time to leave their friends, many people may experience several times as much trauma as they already do.
The United States, France and Turkey have called on the 'occupying forces' to withdraw immediately from Syria
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mowalem called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite eight years of continuous war.
Moallem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister of the country, said that foreign forces are illegally on the country's soil in the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "We will take appropriate measures".
They must leave now unconditionally, he told the council.
Moallem stressed that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus will continue its war against terrorists and "illegal foreign presence" until all Syrian territory is cleared.
There are about 2,000 US troops in Syria, primarily for training and advising both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
The war-torn country has more than 1,000 French troops.
Asked about the refugees, Moallem said the situation was favorable for their return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading unreasonable fear" that has prompted refugees to stay away.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with this return", he said.
They're politics about the whole human problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be provided to Syria until a political agreement is reached to end the war between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last major rebel base in Idlib provides an opportunity to move forward through political negotiations.
The Russia-Turkey agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the area, which is home to three million people.
However, Moallem insisted that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that the military action would work against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be "ruined".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft the post-war constitution and facilitate elections soon.
Moallem expressed the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the provisions of the current Constitution", and warned against unwanted interference.
Why would Trump win the second round?
In this argument, Trump will win re-election in 2020, as many liberals probably expect his presidency to end soon due to impeachment and scandal.
It would be "the most dramatic end of any president!"
So far, there's no sign of the audience changing their minds.
Since 2014, the prime-time rating on CNN has more than doubled to about 1.05 million and for MSNBC it has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News' average prime-time viewership has increased from 1.7 million last year to nearly 2.4 million, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops the ratings with nearly 3.5 million viewers on the big news night.
"It's a fire that attracts people, because it's beyond our comprehension", said Neil Barr, director of ABC drama "Diagnosed Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol was destroyed in an attack.
Another theory is that the writer of the classic comedy novel Neal Scovell and "Just the Funny Parts: Some Hidden Hard Truths in the Hollywood Boys Club" are the authors.
He recalled a taxi trip before the 2016 election.

Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the events that emerge from Washington could shape the future of the Ro Five.
Turning around is a luxury that only the most privileged audience can afford.
And yet, you'll be beyond the grasp of an informed citizen when you see a panel of experts debating for six hours about the use of "deep background" for Bob Woodward's book "Fear", and Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather-wearing bomb jacket (the Washington Post says "fat dress with hubris") and Mr. Trump's, um, stormy Daniels' outspoken statement on the anatomical details.

When we spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 sunny days outside his home on the north coast of Kaua'i, but he was still recording CNN watching MSNBC at home.
He has not been able to escape the strain of the future that is hanging in the hands of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court, facing Brett Kavanaugh.
"I remember when we were doing all the great shows in the '60s and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.

The money from the outside flooded the midterm elections.
It's no surprise that money is flying in Pennsylvania's 17th ballot, as two candidates are running for one seat in the congressional district's reorganization.
The recently redeveloped Pittsburgh District of Pitts has brought Democratic Rep. Connor Lamb to the polls - who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the 12th District of old Pennsylvania, much of which is part of the new 17th District.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were constitutionally unfairly arranged in favor of Republicans, leading to the map being reorganized.
The election campaign in the new 17th district has involved the major parties in a money-laundering competition between the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb gained notoriety after winning the widely-advertised special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District by a narrow margin in March.
The seat has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the same district.
Political scholars are slightly ahead of Democrats.
The U.S. fined El Salvador for supporting China, later withdrawn
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, withdrawing slightly from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama, but later the partners removed the Trump Organization's board of directors.
State Department spokesman Heather North said in a statement earlier this month that "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan" led the department officials to decide to return US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
However, only El Salvador was sanctioned, which received about $140 million in US relief in 2017 for drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included cutting financial aid and specific visa bans, could have been painful for the Central American country due to its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity as a step to prevent immigrants from crowding into the U.S. as they did last year.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear they wanted to hold the conference, effectively ending the possibility of sanctions for El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence will address the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, to give the administration a message on imports.
And the American envoys from the three countries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong messages or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the statements made by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic affairs, on condition of anonymity.
Their statement was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also declined to be named.
Read the history
The next inevitable event could be Robert Mueller's special report on Mr. Trump's possible legal impediments, which now has ample evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller's investigation is reportedly turning to whether Mr. Trump had any ties to Russia during the election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to take his responsibility, just as he is preparing to go back to the voters and eventually may have to take his colleagues to the jury.
There are many if-if issues, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, or his European complement.
The longevity of this dispute will be the preferred role of our inhabitants on both sides of the Atlantic.
In 1938, German officials may have "riot" against Hitler unless the West stopped him and sided with the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid many years of murder.
The course of history often takes such a turn, and the irresistible pace of democracy is sometimes slowed, sometimes delayed.
This is a turning point in American history.
What should we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who will determine the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Since it was published in the paper last year, Rosenstein has been in danger of secretly suggesting recording the president's speech and speculating on his own disability in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times was not true.
"What would our reaction be if the newly launched FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh was incomplete or unfair - or if he was found not guilty in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?"
The big question is, will we elect a Congress in the midterm elections that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail this test, democracy will go to a long sleep.
But I believe we will not fail, because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazis who once occupied my embassy.
He survived, fled to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath lamp on a table with a lighting.
With all this history, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic before the Rapid Vienna fight.
Rangers will play their Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with a win against Austria after a great draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, giving them a good chance to qualify from the Europa League's Group G.
Midfielder Graham Doranes played his first match of the season due to a knee injury in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that relying on this result they can get to a better place.
"This point is very important because Villarreal is a good team", the 31-year-old said.
We got on the field with confidence and managed to take a point.
I could have won in the end, but overall, the draw seems fair.
They played well in the first half and our team did well in the second half.
Thursday, another important night on the European stage.
Hopefully, we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game, because they had a good result in their last game, but I'm sure with the support of the audience we can get a positive result.
Last year didn't go very well, because of my injuries and the changes that have taken place at the club, I feel a lot better about my current situation.
Our team is good and the boys are enjoying great training.
I am confident that we can move forward and succeed after the last season.
Women are losing sleep over the night worrying about savings for retirement.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had no idea how to deal with it, very few people talked about it with their family members.
Half of the nationwide survey respondents said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term service.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want family members to think about them, but they're not taking action for that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Know where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not express your wishes well enough in advance, you will not be able to prepare your family for your ministry.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you want to take care, as determining your preferred costs is also very important.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor can find solutions to these costs.
Your financing choices for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, if you have the money - you can self-insure with a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy or your own assets to help with these expenses.
Remove the solution from your legal documents: Try to stay away from legal battles.
Take a proper health care proxy so that you appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical services and that the professional will follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
And, keep in mind, a power of attorney is a matter of your property.
Choose a trusted person to make your financial decisions and ensure that your bills are paid properly when you are disabled.
Remember the little things: Imagine that your elderly parents need emergency care and are being taken to the hospital.
Are you aware of his allergies and current medications?
Put all these things in a written plan so that you can be prepared.
And it's not just economic, it's also a matter for doctors.
What is the current pharmacy?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Keep your plans straight.

The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, officials said the death toll could rise further afterwards.
As communication was disrupted, rescue workers could not report any information about the Dongala Regency area north of Palur, which is near the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
From Palo, more than 16,000 people have been rescued after the disaster.
Some important facts about the island of Sulawesi:
The capital of the Central Sulawesi state is Palau, located at the end of a narrow gorge on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.

Federal counsel is seeking the death penalty for suspected terrorists in New York.
New York's federal counselors are seeking the death penalty for Sypholo Saypov, a suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people.
Saypov, 30, allegedly used a home depot rental truck to attack a bicycle lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, causing cyclists and pedestrians to peel.
According to a notice filed in the Southern District of New York asking for the death penalty, the conspirators must prove that Sipov "deliberately" killed eight people and "deliberately" injured them severely.
According to court documents, both are sufficient to carry out the death penalty.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury filed 22 charges against Saypov, including eight counts of murder, which are usually brought in organized crime, and include counts of violence and car wrecking.
The councillors said that sufficient planning and forecasting were needed, noting how "abominable, cruel and distorted" Saipov carried out the attack.
Saifulou Habibullayevich Saipov whose family and friends are the cause of injury, loss and loss are Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleaves, Anne-Lora Decatt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlis, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Mendoza, Notices of Intent St.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York executed the last person on death row more than a decade ago.
Defendant Khalid Burns was convicted of the murders of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal case in New York was executed was in 1953, against a married couple named Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were accused of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg couples were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saypov, a resident of Uzbekistan, has not expressed any regrets, the court report said.
Police said she was happy after the incident.
Saypov told officials that he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone at home.
Police said he had also requested that the IS flag be flown in his hospital.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the council's decision.
"We think that the trauma of this incident will prolong in everyone involved in the decision to investigate the death penalty rather than grant a life sentence", Patton said.
Saypov's legal team had earlier appealed for the abolition of the death penalty.
MP Tori said Nigel Farage should be given the responsibility of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage pledged to unite the People's Army in the demonstration at the Tory summit today.
The former WKIP leader said politicians were "heated" by Eurosceptics - while Theresa May's own MP said she should be given the task of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative leader Peter Bonn Birmingham said that if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary, the UK would already be 'out of the EU'.
However, the ice cream Mrs May is eating to keep her deeply divided officials in one place became clear once again when another anti-Brexit protest took place in the anti-Brexit town of Torres.
One of these pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit and EU attacks is the Chechens are taking ice cream to keep the deal on track.
Its allies insist on signing a deal with Brussels despite opposition - and force Europespects and Labour to choose between its package and its 'disorder'.
Mr. Bhon Solihalle told Live Mines Live rally that he wanted 'Chuck Checker'.
He suggested that Mr Farage be made a partner and delegated the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have gotten out of it", he said.
Wellinborough MP added: "I support Brexit, but we need Chuck Checker".
He told his opponents in the EU: "We did not fight the war to live by our own standards.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bonn has blown up the possibility of a change of opinion after the 2016 vote.
Tory Brexit supporter Andre Jenkins was also present at the meeting, who told reporters: "I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chechens are disliked by the general public, the opposition will not vote for them, and the people and activists of our party who have brought us here.
Move the checkers and try to listen.
Speaking sharply to Ms May, he said: "The Prime Minister is considering his position where he should keep his promises.
Mr. Farage said that if the 2016 referendum decision is betrayed, politicians should be forced to understand the situation.
It is now a matter of trust among the people and politicians, he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're going to tell them that if they do, we're not going to let you get away with it either.
To the enthusiastic crowd, he said: 'I want politicians who are trying to betray Brexit to face the opposite situation.
"We are driving the mass forces that have brought us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom".
In the meantime, anti-Brexit protesters marched for two hours through the city centre in Birmingham.
A group of workers formed later this week and displayed a Brexit banner against the Tories.
Labour Party leader Adonis has mocked the Conservatives at the conference after suffering security issues on a party app.
"Some people tell us that they can keep the border clear, free trade on the Irish border, Canada plus plus and the IT system in order", he added.
It's a whole lot of fun.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is considering 'serious scrutiny' of running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would consider running for president after the November election.
The Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts, the Boston Globe reported.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP State candidate Geoff Deale, who was Trump's Massachusetts campaign co-chair in 2016.
There is talk around him that he may run with Trump in the 2020 election.
The meeting was the 36th with his organizers at Holyoke Town Hall on Saturday evening after Trump took office.
One participant asked him about his candidacy for the presidency.
In response, Warren said, "It's time for us to repair this broken government led by a woman.

Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton moves closer to the world title with a gift from his team-mate Sebastian Vettel
This became clear when Valerie Bottas qualified ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, saying that the order of the Mercedes team would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas started well from the pole, almost ignoring Hamilton, holding his position on the first two left and inviting Vettel to attack his own team's player.
Vettel left Hamilton behind the crowd and went into the pit himself, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes driver pitched the next lap and came behind the Vettel, but Hamilton Tanton moved on after the fight, which saw the Ferrari driver make a double move and leave the interior empty at risk of accidentally missing the opportunity.
Max Verstappen began from the back row on his 21st birthday and was seventh after the first lap.
Then he's a lot of the race first, then he's behind Kimi Rikounen with bad tyres and he's fourth.
He pitched on lap 44, but did not improve on the other eight laps, leaving Rykonen in fourth place.
It was a tough day, because Valerie fought hard all weekend and acted like a real gentleman.
The team is doing a great job of putting it first, Hamilton said.
That was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for alleging that she did not leak the letter written by Christine Blazy Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address the issue directly, instead saying that what was happening in the Senate was a reflection of the people's lowliness and cruelty and lying mentality.
"This is one thing that could have happened and this is one of the beautiful things that has been going on in the Senate for the past few weeks, you will see anger when you see the lowly and the mean and the lying people", he said.
When they see the leak, they'll say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
Oh, I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... did you leak the documents?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't leak.
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't, he said, faking the senator.
The letter, which included a description of the charges against Kavanaugh, was sent to Ford Feinstein last July, and leaked in September - but Feinstein denied leaking the letter from his office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak anything", Feinstein told the committee in The Hill's report.
He told me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret, according to his word.
But the president didn't digest it, he opened his mouth at a rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what, it was very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen worse body language.
Speaking on behalf of Supreme Court nominees accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President said Democrats are using the allegations for their own ends.
They want power back at any cost.
Look at the low-minded, look at the mean, don't stop them from hurting anyone, don't stop them from stepping down to gain power and control", the president said.

The area is shaking repeatedly in the strong aftershocks and people are stuck in the rubble of the Palu.
But despite the fear of all his colleagues fleeing, 21-year-old Anthony Guanawan Palur's pearls did not escape from the horribly hanging control tower of Sis al-Jufri airport.
He went on to confirm that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could fly safely.
Then he jumped down, fearing the control tower would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesian Air Navigation spokesman Johannes Seiret said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News in Australia.
We arranged a helicopter from Baliqpaapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died before the helicopter reached Palou this morning.
"We are heartbroken to hear this news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities feared that the death toll could exceed thousands, the disaster response agency said that connections to Donggala, Sigi and Butong have been limited.
The death toll is believed to be on the rise, as many bodies are trapped under the rubble that has not yet been reached, said agency spokesman Sutopo Puro Nugroho.
The six-meter-high wave of destruction is blowing through the lagoon where mass graves will be arranged on Sunday.
Relief and assistance is being provided by military and commercial aircraft.
Reza Kusuma, 35, told Sky News: "Every minute there are bodies in ambulances.
There is no clean water.
Small markets are looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfund, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rapidly bringing aid to the living, but we don't know what to see there.
It's already sad, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the country on Sunday and told the army: "I urge you to stay in rescue work day and night.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Lombo, Indonesia killed more than 550 people.
Air New Guinea says one person is missing in a plane crash in Laguna, Micronesia
When an airline plane crashed in the Pacific lagoon of Micronesia, they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea reported on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to track him down.
The airline immediately declined to provide details such as the age and nationality of the passenger.
Local boats rescued passengers and crew after the plane crashed while attempting to land at Chuck Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were also in hospital on Saturday, and all are in stable condition.
The cause of the accident is still unclear.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the plane sank before reaching the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jens said the plane went down very low.
"That's a very good thing", says Jens.
Jens said he and others crossed the waistline to reach the emergency door of the sinking plane.
He said the flight crew was screaming in terror and he had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were also working on a nearby jet repair also assisted in the rescue operation, taking people ashore by a windy boat before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) in water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died on the PNG-registered airline in the past two decades, but no crashes have occurred on Air New Guinea.
Analysts have managed to track the burning of the living woman.
Prosecutors on Saturday put the case before a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. forensic analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cellphone records to create the story of the 29-year-old suspect Quinton Teles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he recovered several cell phone records suggesting that Teles and Chambers were together on the night of his death, which is contrary to Teles' previous position, Clarion Laser reports.
Reports indicate that his cell phone was with the chamber at the time, although he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, police have spoken to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that night.
When councilmen asked if Teles was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that it was a lie because his truck was in Nashville that night.
Another discrepancy is that Teles said she knew Chambers two weeks before he died.
Cell phone records show they had known each other for only a week.
Rolette said that shortly after Chambers' death, Teleus deleted text, call and contact information from its phones.
"He's wiping her out of his life", Haley said.
The final arguments in the case are scheduled for Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to go to the jury the next day.

Another black?!
New York Nanny sued a couple for firing after a racist text.
A New York nanny is suing a related couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misleading text from a mother that she called "another black man".
The couple denied the allegations of being racist and filed a lawsuit for the allegations of Zulum.
Two-year-old mother Lindsay Plasco-Falksman expressed disappointment after arriving on her first day at work in 2016 to learn that Gisele Morris, the new baby sitter, was a black woman.
Another black woman, Ms. Plasco-Falksman, texted her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Morris, twice.
Later realizing her mistake, the disgruntled Plasco-Falksman fired Ms. Morris. She said that she expected a Filipino to work poorly with their former nanny, who was African-American, the New York Post reports.
Miss Morris was given a day's quarantine and then Uber called her home.
Morris is now suing the couple for compensation for the eviction and is seeking compensation of $350 a day for six months, although she was initially hired as a stay-at-home nanny without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, that can't be done", he told the Post on Friday, adding that further yoga yoga yoga yoga tax yoga, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple said against their claim that they were racist that it was reasonable to expel Maurice for fear that he would not be trusted after being charged.
My wife didn't want to say what she sent.
He's not a racist.
We are not a racist couple, " said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
But will you leave your children to someone you have abused, even though they have done wrong?
Your newborn?
Tell me what.
Regarding the allegations of Zulum, Plasco said his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and was in very difficult circumstances.
Would you like to go up against someone like that?
It's not a good thing to do, says the investment banker.
The public court has strongly condemned the couple's behavior and argument on social media in the context of ongoing legal proceedings.
Paddington Publishing fears that readers may not be able to relate to talking bears, the new paper says.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to say what the first reader will think before publication.
It's a lot of fun to know after Paddington's big success.
His father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write children's books from a small toy bear, said he was optimistic about his job being rejected. He added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "unforgettable" to him after his death last year.
Regarding Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", her father said he was very proud of her ultimate success.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not a proud man", he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that it was like your own child had achieved something: you were proud of him, even though you had no part in it.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was the product of his own creativity and imagination, he always credited himself to Paddington.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Soon after landing, her daughter was taken to Nice Hospital, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Nad called regularly saying that it was too bad, and he probably wouldn't survive, Ms. Ednan-Laperoz said.
Then I got Ned's phone and I knew he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him on the phone.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart functioning were slowly stopping working in her body and leaving her body.
He died a while ago, and then it all came to a halt.
I had no choice but to sit and wait, you know.
I couldn't even cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold on.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperoz, then mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - she was uncomfortable with the difficult situation.
No one knew, he said.
I was bowed down, and my eyes were continually running down.
It's impossible to describe, but I was sitting on the plane, feeling Ned's insatiable pain.
That she needs my love and compassion.
I know how much he loved her.
Bednarat posted a suicide stop card on this woman's bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to stop others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries posted inspirational messages and phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge where people can call for help.
Miss Davis' son Tyler suffered from depression from the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I'm constantly feeling", she said.
Miss Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a promising chef and had an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile made the room brighter.
But before he died, he had to stop, because he had gone through the darkness.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, was found dead.
Miss Davis: "I am constantly worried that this effort will be interrupted.
Miss Davis created a card to let everyone know that there is someone you can talk to, and that they can be friends.
Don't sit still - you need to talk.
Miss Humphries, who has been Miss Davis' girlfriend for many years, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark shortly after her mother died.
She never said she was upset or depressed or anything, she said.
I noticed some changes in her habits two days before Christmas.
She was in a very bad situation on Christmas Day - she didn't even look at the kids when they opened their presents.
She said her death was a huge emotional blow to them, but they had to cope: it created a huge vacuum in the family.
It's torn us apart.
But we must walk and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is being questioned by the FBI when it begins its investigation.
"I thought, if we could give something he wanted - since the investigation time is limited, the opportunity is limited - we could probably bring some unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters ask for an FBI investigation?
Their obligations are time-bound.
With only five weeks left until the November 6 midterm elections - if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, their efforts to win the Supreme Court's nomination will be very weak.
George W. Bush is calling the Senators and asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House under Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would then allow Vice President Mike Pence to break ties and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
North Korean resignations have been reduced under Kim
North Korean resignations have declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung-seog, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, said that the number of resignations last year was 1,127 - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the main reasons for this were strict border controls between North Korea and China and the money laundering of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
A large number of North Korean dissidents have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most have fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than through the DMZ between the two Koreas.
China treats these refugees not as refugees but as illegal immigrants and often forcibly returns them to their countries.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are still actually at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks centered on stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This follows the historic June meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, who unanimously agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for lack of progress.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Lee said, "If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such a situation we will not in any way unilaterally disarm ourselves first".
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a hysterical patient, saying she was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi has described Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterically-ridden" and said he is inherently unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever did something like this, she would be called hysterical", Pelosi said of her response to Kavanagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has strongly denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Kristin Blazy when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was emotional, screaming and holding her breath as he talked about his family and high school life.
He clearly denounced the Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a "wild and yogi-like character organized by the Liberals", alleging that it was done out of anger over Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election defeat.
Pelosi said he believes Cavaniff's testimony proves he is not qualified for the Supreme Court, as it proves he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he has proven himself incompetent in the statements he made and in the way he has challenged Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
When asked if he would impeach Kavanaugh if confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi made a statement.
"I would say that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only not qualified for the Supreme Court, but also the court he's in now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Circuit Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned that Kavanaugh would oppose the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he was a Conservative justice himself.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh has avoided the question of whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"It is not allowed that a hysterical, biased person will go to court and tell us whether it is not great", Pelosi said.
And women should control it.
It's a fair debate, months and years of anger, and she can't help but cry.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's rare, what do you say?
She also said that a female executive helped me a lot who said that she too cried when she got angry. But she chose the approach that when she started crying when she got angry, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You may think I am sad because I am crying".
I'm really pissed off.
Then he kept going.
I thought it was amazing.
Tears serve as an expression of anger in part, because they are primarily victims of misunderstandings.
I have a vivid memory of my early job, a man-managed office, where I once saw myself crying in incredible rage, an old woman holding my scarf -- a feared manager I was always a little bit afraid of -- who pulled me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to see you.
Patrick Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with her during Gary Hart's presidential campaign.
When Mr. Hart was caught in a monkey business boat overseas in 1987 about being divorced and dropped out of the race for dirty work, deeply frustrated Ms. Schroeder thought there was no reason not to run for her own presidency.
"It was not a very thoughtful decision", he said with a smile after 30 years.
Seven other candidates are already in the running, and no one else wants one.
One called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
He was behind in raising funds because of the delay in the campaign and so he vowed not to run until he raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He saw that if a supporter gives a man $1,000, he gets only $250.
"Do they think I will get a discount?" he asked in amazement.
When he announced that he would not campaign, he became overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude to his supporters, frustrated with the system that made raising money difficult, targeted voters without representatives, and became ill with anger over gender discrimination.
"You may have thought I was nervous", Ms. Schroeder recalled the media reaction.
You might think that Clinix is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, where are they gonna bury me?
Did he cry?
How can this US-China trade war go in Beijing's favor?
The first phase of the US-China trade war was tumultuous, and when the war is over, Beijing could benefit from the conflict in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump first warned earlier this year of tax hikes on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase was this week, when new tariffs were imposed on almost half of total imports from China, amounting to about 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds).
Beijing has retaliated the same way it has done - most recently, it has increased tariffs of five to 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has decided to fight with its eyes closed and there is no way that the world's second largest economy will soon lose its eyesight.
Withdrawing Washington would mean a rollback, but publicly bowing to the United States would be highly offensive to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play the tail right, the pressure of the US trade war could help China to reduce interdependence between the two economies in the long run.
"Any swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could lead to a situation that could lead to economic collapse in both countries, which is far more dangerous than the Waqibah Mahall idea", said Abigail Grace, associate researcher at the think tank, Center for New American Security, who discusses Asia.
Syria is ready to take back its refugees, the Foreign Minister said.
Syria has said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and has appealed for the reconstruction of the country, which has been ravaged by seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said the situation in the country is improving.
The situation is stable and secure today due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate to restore normalcy to areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now favourable for the voluntary return of people who have been forced to leave their country due to the daily life and livelihoods being disrupted by terrorism and the surrounding economic conditions.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people who have left the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said the Syrian government welcomes all assistance in the reconstruction of the country.
However, he also stressed that no conditional aid will be accepted or any aid from the country that supports the rebels will be accepted.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating USA with a final score of 16.5-10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The USA lost six straight times on European soil and have not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Led by Danish captain Thomas Beans, the team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States and regained the title.
American star Phil Mickelson, who did not play well for most of the tournament, drowned his T-shot at the Par-3 16th hole, losing to Francisco Molinari in his match.
Italian golfer Molinari became one of only four out of 1 to score above 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979, with brilliant performances in all rounds.
American Jordan Speith, the lowest ranked player in the European team, has been topped out at 5 and 4 by Denmark's Thorbjørn Olsen.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost to Ian Polter of England in 2 and 1, who probably played his last Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Sergio Garcia of Spain holds the record for most career wins in Europe with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't this time.
It's been a bad year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and for trusting me.
I'm so happy to have the cup back.
It is a team achievement, I am happy that I was able to help", said Garcia, enthusiastic about the European victory.
He handed over to his country's John Ram, who lost to US legend Tiger Woods in Sunday's Singles 2 and 1.
"I am very proud to have lost Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old John Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and his Ryder Cup record stands at 13-21-3.
That's an uncanny statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles since just top-ranked Jack Nicklaus.
The team has been in the USA all weekend except for high-quality performers Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of them, they fought.
This morning we put some pressure on Europe.
We couldn't.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll turn around, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
I love these 12 and am proud to be their captain.
You have to respect them.
We didn't make it to the game.
Red Stream updates: Pines, Manati and Sarasota have decreased densities
