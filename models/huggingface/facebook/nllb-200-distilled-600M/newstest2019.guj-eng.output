A thousand farmers reached the high court in front of the Gujarat development dream project bullet train
The High Court has filed a petition against the Union Government's acquisition of land from Gujarat farmers for the Dream Project Bullet Train.
During the hearing of the petition, 1,000 farmers expressed the fact that the State Government has no right to acquire their land by signing a deed.
The bench of the Chief Justice had given the ultimatum to the Central Government that if the Central Government does not reply on the land acquisition by 26th, the court will issue a final order.
The High Court has also turned a blind eye to the Central Government for bribing the High Court and Supreme Court orders.
Further hearings on this matter will be held on September 26.
The High Court took the State Government's cue after hearing an appeal against the allegations of a thousand farmers in a total of eight districts of Gujarat in the Interstate Bullet Train Project.
You are misleading the court.
You said that only four or seven farmers objected to your presentation, but a large number of farmers were also indicted.
Farmers' Advocate Anand Yaagnik argued that the Union Government has not been providing a response to the country's most expensive project of Rs. 1 lakh 10 lakh crore, which is linked to more than one state, despite the fact that it has taken more than 3 months to complete, and does not follow the guidance of JICA.
The Central Government is making efforts to avoid the case going forward in the High Court without giving an answer.
Since the Centre or the State Government has no strong defence against land acquisition, the last weapon being the threat of collectors to the farmers.
As new conditioned land is being taken, blackmail is being done to seize land.
The threat of confiscation is being made if the land is not acquired.
Despite the Supreme Court's order dated August 10, the Union Government has not submitted a response to the High Court.
As a result, the farmers will go to the Supreme Court again tomorrow and demand that their order be complied with.
Over 3,000 farmers from 8 districts of Gujarat will travel to Japan to save their land and inform the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) of all facts about the injustices committed against them by the Central Government.
The Union Government's agreement with JICA also provides for cancellation if there is injustice to farmers.
Farmers will inform JICA that a contract for bullet trains with JICA of Japan has been signed for the bullet tram for thousands of crore rupees.
But Japan has not yet given more than Rs 300 crore in installments.

Internationally, China is trying to make the yuan an international currency at the same level as the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
Given the potential for economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are looking for ways to make the deal in rupees and rubles.
International Desk: India and Russia today agreed on S-400 defense missile system amid the clamor of US sanctions.
The MoU will be signed by President Vladimir Putin of Russia on the second day of his two-day visit to India with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The path to approval of the S-400 deal is in the process of finding a way between the two countries to get the US dollar for payment of the deal.
Sources claim that given the potential for economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are looking for ways to make the deal in rupees and rubles.
The US imposed a ban on China during the deal.
It is worth mentioning that in September, Russia signed an S-400 missile deal with China.
Following the deal, US President Donald Trump decided to ban China.
The ban made it almost impossible for China to buy a missile using US dollars.
However, over the past few years, China has sought to establish its currency as the yuan as an international currency against the dollar.
Since this initiative, China has been continuously trying internationally to convert the yuan into an international currency equivalent to the dollar, euro, yen and pound.
On the other hand, China has the largest US dollar reserve in international trade.
China wants to make the yuan an international currency
The US could impose a Qatsa ban on the $5 billion mega defense deal (CAATSA) through the Counter-American Adversaries Section.
Last month, the US imposed a ban on China buying S-400 missile systems.
India and Russia have since begun to establish an alternative arrangement for this deal.
The US ban on the repair deal for the INS Chakra, which was previously leased from Russia, has led to an estimated $2 billion deal between India and Russia.
The economic analyst claims that to get out of this situation, India should exercise the use of the rupee-ruble exchange as an international currency.
It is worth mentioning that all defence deals concluded by India with Russia so far have been made using the dollar.
Why was the American Law of Quit?
President Donald Trump approved the Katsa Act in August in response to Russia's modern defense missile system. - The United States has drafted the law to prevent Russia from acting against American interests internationally.
It is worth mentioning that the US law was drafted in response to Russia's actions.
These include Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine, the annexation of Crimea, involvement in the Syrian civil war, and interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
Then suddenly a thousand-year-old secret was revealed.
This is the story of a Turkish man who made a big discovery while repairing a house.
When the wall of his basement collapsed while repairing, he collided with a secret door.
From here he reached an underground tunnel, where he encountered a thousand-year-old city hidden in the ground.
The pictures of the city show how about 20,000 people lived here in this underground city with all their belongings and food and drink.
600 gates to enter the city:
The story is set in 1963, when a Turkish man living in Cappadocia discovered an underground city.
The wall of his basement collapsed while repairing the house.
From here, an underground city called Darinyuku was found, located at a depth of 280 feet underground.
Its depth was equal to that of an 18-story building.
This underground city was sometimes home to 20,000 people, with preparations for everything from rooms, kitchens, schools, churches, cemeteries, etc. to ventilation.
There are 600 gates to enter and exit the city.
Heavy doors are installed here to stop intruders into the underground city.
Each floor can be closed separately.
It is believed that the city was built between 780 and 1180 CE during the Byzantine era to protect the people from the Arab-Byzantine war and natural disasters.
Turned into a tourist attraction:
Darinkuyu is not the only underground city in the world.
There are many other cities like this but this is the largest underground city among them.
It is only halfway through the city but has become a popular tourist attraction in Cappadocia.
Because of its historical and cultural significance, people come here to see it.

Whether or not prayer in mosques is an integral part of Islam, Supreme Court today decides
The High Court is likely to pronounce its decision on Thursday on the petitions of the Muslim group demanding a big back review of the 1994 decision of the High Court on the right dispute of Ram Janam Bhumi - Babri Masjid Mallaka.
It is worth mentioning that the High Court had said in its decision that prayers in mosques are not an integral part of Islam.
According to the news agency, Chief Justice Deepak Mishra and Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice S Abdul Nazir will deliver their verdict on the backs of the judges.
The back had secured him on July 20.
A radical M Siddique in the Ayodhya case had objected to this particular conclusion in the 1994 decision in the case of M Ismail Farouki.
It stated that mosques are not an integral part of the prayers offered by followers of Islam.
Siddique is dead and is represented by his legal heir.
The Muslim communities have argued before the back of the Chief Justice that the decision needs to be reconsidered by the five-member back of the High Court's observation.
Because its Babri Mosque - Ram Temple, will have an impact on land disputes.
Senior Speaker Rajiv Dhawan, speaking on behalf of Siddiqui's legislative representative, said that the mosque is not an integral part of Islam.
The High Court made this comment without any kind of investigation or consideration of religious books.
The Uttar Pradesh government had told the Supreme Court that some Muslim communities are seeking to reconsider the comment that the mosque is not an integral part of Islam and are trying to delay the long-standing Ayodhya Temple-Massjid land dispute.
Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, speaking on behalf of the Upper Government, said the dispute had been awaiting final decision for almost a century.
The biggest drop in rupee to date, against the dollar, reached 71
The dollar demand increased amid rising crude oil prices and the rupee today reached a low of Rs 71 with a 26 pence drop in initial trade.
The domestic currency opened at Rs 70.95 yesterday against the dollar in the interbank foreign exchange market and then went to Rs 71 level.
The rupee closed at 70.74 on Thursday.
According to currency traders, strong demand for US currency from oil importers at the end of the month, with trade tensions between China and the US hoping for higher interest rates, the strengthening of the dollar against other major currencies in the world affected domestic currencies.
The rise in crude oil prices has also affected the inflation risk and the domestic stock market, which is also affected by exports from the reserves of foreign institutional investors.
At the beginning of Asian trade, the price of standard braite crude reached $78 a barrel.
On the first visit, the secretary had taken the prophecy to Earth Sha.
Sports Desk: Pherithi Shah has made a century in his Test match debut.
The comparison of Earth Sha is being made with Sachin Tendulkar.
Just as Earth has played a big innings at school level, Sachin has been in the discussion of innings.
Sachin Tendulkar tweeted his greetings to the century-winning Bhiti Shah.
On the first visit, the secretary had taken the earth to Shanna.
Sachin Tendulkar was also seen happy with the start of Prithvi Shah.
The Secretary also praised the Earth.
Sachin recalled the day when he first saw Pratibha Shah batting and said take him away.
Sharing his experience, Sachin said about 10 years ago his friend Jagdish Chuha once asked me to watch Pṛthī Shāya bat.
'This young player wants to meet you and if you can meet him, it will be fine,' said Chuhan.
Sachin believed his friend and went to see his batting.
'He still remembers today that he told his friend that this child will play for India one day,' he told his friend that he was looking at the future Indian cricketer.
Then the friend of the secretary said: "Are you telling the truth?
On which the Secretary said, "Remember my words, this child will play for India.
The secretary told about the greatest beauty of the earth shah.
Praising the earth shea, the secretary said, "What I have seen, he (the earth shea) learns quickly.
It is different to have talent in a player but it is more important to know what you do with that talent.
If you want to succeed in international cricket, you need to have the ability to learn quickly.
Adaptability (ability to play according to circumstances) is required to play for long periods of time in different grounds and conditions.
I think that Earth Sha has the ability to play in different situations in terms of game and this is the biggest strength on Earth.
The secretary said that the coordinates of the hands and eyes of the earth shaha belong to Kamal.
The way he holds the line and the lanth of the ball is very rare in players.
This is a natural gift of the Earth, which is not in many of these players.

What is the meaning of the word "the king"?
How can the Darbari language of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, the destroyer of the Somnath temple and a villain to the common Indian, be Sanskrit?
In fact, research by Professor Shantha Pande, a historian at Delhi University, has shown that the official language of Ghazni was Sanskrit.
It was only natural to question that when the Shri Somnath Trust honoured Dr Gautam Patel and Dr Mani Bhai Prasadpati for their service to Sanskrit, Sanskrit was only the language of the so-called upper-class Brahmins.
The Punjab Pandit, a slave from Mumbai, was remembered.
The 87-year-old scholar, who speaks Sanskrit, which is easy for the Riksha to understand, is still finalising the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Qur'an before its release.
The word holy Quran is Sanskrit in their eyes.
Quran means the voice or teaching of the Messenger on earth.
He was not only educated in the school of Solapur, but is now considered one of the greatest Sanskrit scholars of the country.
However, the very simple life of Panditji does not seek to go to America or other countries to give lectures as a Sanskrit scholar to market himself.
The Princess of Thailand is a Sanskrit scholar.
There he teaches himself Sanskrit.
Usuko has to go to the University of Bonn in Germany to learn Sanskrit from the US.
In India, besides the Hindu University of Banaras, most universities also have a Ph.D. thesis in Sanskrit which is written in the language of that state.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught in Gujarati, but remember that in Takshila and Nalanda universities, education was given in Sanskrit medium.
The Pradhan Mantra of Sanskrit in Afghanistan, Shantha Pande has said that not only was the Darbari language of the Sultan of Ghazni Sanskrit, he also inscribed his money coins in Sanskrit.
The coins are inscribed with Quranic importations in Sanskrit and the Sanskrit grammar author Panini is a resident of Shalapur, Afghanistan, the Pande also noted.
Pandit Nehru has said that the Pashto of Afghan and Patan derived from Sanskrit in a large chapter in "My Hindu philosophy" entitled "The Strength and Sustainability of the Sanskrit Language".
Today, it is widely accepted that not only Indian languages but also Indo-European languages are derived from Sanskrit.
Another surprise about Dr. Ambedkar's national language is that the chief framer of the Constitution, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and several other Muslims and members of the South Indian Constituent Assembly proposed that Sanskrit be made the national language of the country.
The Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. B. V. Keskar and Nazruddin Ahmed were among those who proposed Sanskrit as the national language when the discussion on the national language was held in the Constituent Assembly on 13 September 1949 on Hindi vs. English.
The discussion of the day and the report published in the National Herald of 11 September 1949 before that date suggest the agitation of the Sanskrit language.
Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to determine a national language.
22 Indian languages including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu are included as official languages in our Constitution, but none are the national languages.
As per the 2011 census, Sanskrit is now the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country. We have placed Sanskrit in a position like a gangia of beauty.
With respect to Sanskrit, Prime Minister Nehru also spoke respectfully about Sanskrit in the Constituent Assembly.
In a related chapter of his book, he turned to Sanskrit and explained the importance that Sanskrit has been given by scholars around the world: "In 1874 Sir William Jones said, 'God knows how ancient the Sanskrit language is, but its design is amazing.
He is more complete than Greek, more abundant than Latin, and more polite than both.
Nehru further notes: "I don't know how many times Sanskrit has become a dead language, i.e. when it became a folk language".
Today, Sanskrit is the language of taking oaths through members like Union Minister Smriti Irani as a Prayer or Member of Parliament.
We need to celebrate the year of Sanskrit and make it a living and folk language.
If the dead language of Israel could bring Hebrew back to life, Sanskrit is still a living language.
It is only when a serious effort is made to make it a folk language rather than a symbolic effort.
After the airport reception, who did Narendra Modi point to and ask to come with him?
