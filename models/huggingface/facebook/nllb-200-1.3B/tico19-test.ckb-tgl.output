Obtaining the number of confirmed and confirmed cases of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) reported the number of COVID-19 cases in all countries worldwide, only from official sources such as countries' health ministries, regional health authorities and WHO, and updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
As a factor in the development of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day short-term COVID-19 case prevalence and thus the natural COVID-19 cycle in each EU country and UK during the period 1 January-15 March 2020.
We also provided the estimated number of reported cases in each of our countries at 8:00 am on March 15 compared to the number in Italy during the period January 31-15 March.
COVID-19 trend in EU and UK countries
The 14-day COVID-19 case summary order in EU countries and the UK generally follows the order in Hubei Province in China (Figure 1.

This was largely due to the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but all other EU countries and the UK showed a similar trend in their own COVID-19 infection rates.

This indicates that at 8:00 am on 15 March, the total cases in 15 other EU countries and the UK were equal to the total cases in Italy in 3 weeks or less this week.
Our results show that the number of reported COVID-19 cases in EU countries and the UK is increasing rapidly.
The observed COVID-19 prevalence patterns show that this prevalence is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and are not always the same in terms of national public health response, as well as in terms of case definition and protocols for identifying patients for testing for COVID-19 infection.

Data on hospitalization of COVID-19 patients in a hospital and in an intensive care unit in EU/EEA countries are currently only 6% and 1% respectively (data not shown).

A study conducted in November 2010 shows a significant difference in the number of ICU beds available in Europe, with the figure in Germany being 29.2 beds per 100,000 people and in Portugal 4.2 beds per 100,000 people.
This suggests that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds per 100,000 people in November 2020).
The modelling scenarios for healthcare capacity utilisation, with the prevalence of COVID-19 sleeping sickness in each EU country and UK associated with a risk of over 90% increased capacity of intensive care beds, are included in the sixth update of the ECDC's Rapid COVID-19 Risk Assessment.

2019-COVID coronavirus pandemic, caused by coronavirus 2 (2-SARS-CoV) respiratory infectious syndrome (SARS) has so far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 people in China and other countries worldwide, which could be catastrophic for humans.
Like its cousin, the SARS-CoV coronavirus, which infected thousands of people in 2003, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 may have been transmitted by bats and may have caused similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
COVID-19 is less severe and less deadly than SARS, but has a much higher transmission rate and affects older adults and men more than younger men and women.
This article provides a timely and comprehensive assessment of the rapidly evolving research in response to the increasing number of publications related to this emerging disease.
We will discuss the basic principles of pathology, causology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction and prevention of disease.

The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the respiratory infection syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the related disease COVID-19.
The pandemic originated in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to approximately 50 countries around the world.

WHO warns that COVID-19 is "public enemy No. 1" and is much stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, over 200 articles have been published about COVID-19 covering the areas of virology, pathogenology, causology, diagnosis and treatment of the disease since the first reported case on 7 January 2020, and have identified the genomic sequence of the virus in several different patients.
This assessment seeks to abstract the research trend in this new journal as it rapidly evolves.

On January 20, infections were reported among healthcare workers and it was noted that the disease was capable of human-to-human transmission.

On December 24, the first medical study reported that of the 41 confirmed cases of the disease, only 21 people had direct exposure to the seafood market and thus the first known source of the disease was identified.

SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but most are aged 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the cases were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old and only 14 cases were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 was more prevalent in males (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
Covid-19 outbreaks have generally developed in Hubei and surrounding areas.
Covid-19 takes an average of 5 (9-2) days to become diagnosed.
The median time between infection and onset of disease is 4.8 (7.2-3.0) days.
The average time to death is 9.5 (13-4.8) days.
The initial R0 of the disease was 3.77 (95% CI:3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 4.82-2.32.
The number of cases increased significantly before 23 December, coinciding with the mass movement of people ahead of the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate among confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI:1.10-1.86%) and the co-morbidity rate among all cases was 3.06% (95% CI:2.02-4.59%).
Tri top risk factors for COVID-19 are gender, age (over 60), and acute respiratory infection.
Coronavirus is a large, coated family of single-stranded RNA viruses.
The virus can be divided into four genera, namely, alpha, beta, gamma and delta. The alpha and beta corona strains can infect humans.
In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses, the glycoprotein spike (S) layer is co-receptor with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipoptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and membrane coagulation occurs.
The RNA genome of the virus is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the virus genome, the genetic RNAs are combined with glycoprotein sheaths and nucleosapsid proteins to form the vesicles of the virus which then fuse with the plasma membrane to infect the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome sequence was announced on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus with 99.98% of the genetic identity among 10 samples collected at the primary site of the virus' origin at the Hunan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.

ACE2 in humans has been identified as a receptor for both SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-CoV coronaviruses.
SARS-CoV-2 is much less likely to infect humans than SARS-CoV, and therefore the severity of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is less than that caused by SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2s also can form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a decay protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus orf3b may play a role in pathogenicity of the virus and in inhibiting IFNβ expression; whereas, orf8 has no known functional role.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and colleagues reported the cryo-EM structure of the entire human ACE2 at the A 2.9 concentration in combination with the amino acid phosphate B0AT1.
They found that this open-closed, dimer-like structure and ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins together, providing evidence for the identification and replication of the coronavirus.
B0AT1

G et al. ont identifié le virus comme transmissible de la chauve-souris à l'homme, générant une synthèse homogène avec une protéine de type S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolin - a parasitic mammal that is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine - may be the central host of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus because there is a 99% genetic similarity between the virus found in pangolin and the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

The physical and chemical properties of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus are not yet fully understood.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses can survive in a dry environment for up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 °C and a humidity of 40%-50% in an out-of-body state for up to 48 hours.
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and 56 °C heat for 30 minutes; acyl alcohol, 75% ethanol, chlorine if containing antiviral, acetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty acids, other than chlorhexidine, can effectively kill this virus.

In general, after a virus attacks its host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including C-type transcriptional receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors, and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).

SARS-CoV N-type protein also helps the virus escape the immune response.

T-lymphocyte, in which CD4+CD8+T cells play an important role in immunity.
CD4+T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8+T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells are cells that produce cytokines prior to infection, intended to help the immune system.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Liquid resistance, including complementes such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also essential to fight viral infections.
For example, antibodies taken from recovering patients will inactivate the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the immune system's self-regulatory response spontaneously generates large amounts of free radicals that can cause massive damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst-case scenario, lead to multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 is a mild form of coronavirus infection that is more likely to affect older adults and pregnant women.
Some people who are exposed to high levels of viruses or have a compromised immune system are more likely to be infected than others.
According to a study of 425 initial cases in Wuhan, the estimated survival time for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with a peak of 3-7 days.
Similarly, a study of 1,099 cases showed a median incidence duration of 3 days and ranged from 0 days to 24 days.
Recent studies, also mentioned above, show that the incubation period was 4.8 (7.2-3.0) days with a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important for health authorities to establish effective quarantine timing based on the most accurate time of onset of disease, thus preventing transmission of the virus from asymptomatic individuals to others.
As a general practice, people who are infected or exposed to other patients, usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Do you need to extend the quarantine period to 24 days?
It is often the primary symptom of COVID-19 that can be seen alone or with other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, gout, diarrhea, burning mucous membranes, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, heart confusion and diarrhea.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In severe cases, the disease progresses rapidly to respiratory problems, hypertension and organ failure, bioacids and hemophilia.

Two recent studies on familial mildness and mild transmission from an asymptomatic individual have found similar results.

80% of these patients, however, required artificial respiration, which is much higher than in COVID-19 patients, and this is consistent with the higher MERS death rate from COVID-19.
Spasm (26%) and lead burn (21%) were also seen in MERS patients.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️


For MERS, according to a demographic survey in June 2012, the fatality rate was 37% in 2,494 confirmed cases.

A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 is given in Table 1.1.
The above variants suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is more transmissible than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV viruses, but less lethal than the other two.
Sars-CoV-2 is much more difficult to control than the two MERS-CoVs and SARS-CoV.

For example, a lymphopenia with a white blood cell count < 4x109/L had a lymphocyte count of < 1x109/L and elevated levels of aminotransferase aspartate and viremia were seen in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of muscle enzymes, bile, and myoglobin in the blood have been seen to increase in some patients, and C-reaction protein and red blood cell placement have been seen to increase in most patients.
In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the levels of D-dimer, a precursor to fibrin, in the blood, were elevated and the number of lymphocytes decreased dramatically.
The chest x-ray abnormality was observed in most COVID-19 patients and is characterized by a triangular patch on either side or a dark, glass-like appearance in the lungs.
Patients usually show abnormal pneumonia, severe lung damage, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).

The malfunction of type 1 and 2 pneumocytes which decreases the levels of sulfactane and increases the absorption of substances, thereby reducing the lung's ability to expand, and increasing the risk of lung failure.
The more severe the patient's chest x-ray, the more likely the disease is to be hidden.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed that killing of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membranes, and theft of interstitial lymph nodes, and synaptic cells in the lungs of patients who died from the virus, were similar to those of viral infectious disease and ARDS and similar to those of SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was considered as a key measure for the detection of COVID-19.

Similar situation occurred for the diagnosis of SARS.
It is a combination of pre-existing conditions, clinical signs, laboratory tests, and diagnostic findings that are needed to achieve an effective and orderly diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group described a protocol using the SHERLOCK or CRISPR-based technique for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which detects the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in 20x10-18mol/L to 200x10-18mol/L (10-100 copies per microl injected) by sampling from a single drop in less than a minute without the need for precision instruments.

It was also found that cytokine swelling, a result of reactions in the immune system of SARS and MERS patients.
Cytocin release is a form of systemic inflammatory response that is mediated by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines force immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which is a major cause of ARDS and various organ failure.
Immunosuppression for the treatment of cytokine overdose, especially in patients with dementia.
Corticosteroids and tosilezomabs, and a monoclonal antibody to IL6, have been used to treat cytokine inflammation.
Other immune system suppressor treatments for cytokine overdose include inhibiting the immune system response to T cells, blocking IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF and inhibiting JAK; blinatomab; cytokine4 signaling inhibitor; and HDAC activator.
Steroids, as immune system stimulants, are widely used to treat SARS with the intention of reducing the severity of infection damage.

Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug that was originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Malvorog viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also demonstrated its effectiveness in inhibiting single-stranded RNA viruses, including SARS and MERS viruses.
Accordingly, Gilead has provided this component to China to perform testing of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus patients and the results have been very predictable.
Also, baricitinib, alpha interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin, are recommended as potential medications for patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection.
Spawn, heartburn, vomiting, gallstones, and other adverse reactions may occur after the use of lopinavir/ritonavir combination therapy.
The interaction of these drugs with other drugs in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody production

In fact, recovering patients often have high levels of antibodies to fight the pathogen in their blood.

TCM has been used for thousands of years in China to treat a variety of ailments.
However, its effectiveness mostly depends on a combination of multiple components in a formula that differs according to the diagnosis of the disease based on the theories of TCM.
Most active ingredients remain unknown or obscure because it is difficult to extract and verify the ingredients in this form or suitable mixture.

For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been shown to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest treatment rates of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces of China with 87% of patients receiving TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), whereas in Hubei Province TCM was used for only 30% of COVID-19 patients, and the recovery rate was lowest (13%).
This is a very small proportion, however, as many other influencing factors such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease must be taken into account in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli ZHang and colleagues conducted a study on comparing Western medicine (WM) treatments alone.
They found that the time needed to recover body temperature, symptom remission, and hospital admission in the WM+TCM group were significantly shorter than in the WM-only group.
Significantly, the rate of symptom worsening (from mild to severe) in the WM+TCM group was lower than in the WM-only group (7.4% versus 46.2%), and the mortality rate in the WM+TCM group was lower than in the WM-only group (8.8% versus 39%).

Then, overcoming this problem is very difficult due to the prolonged time needed to develop a vaccine (about 18 months) and the changing mobility of coronaviruses.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its clinical cycle in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover without the disease.
However, just like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is causing a lot of morbidity and death in rare cases.

According to the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be related to the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table33):
Age: Age is the most important factor in the recovery time from SARS as well as COVID-19.
COVID-19 was more prevalent in the 65-30 age group and in a study involving 8,866 people 47.7% of patients were over 50 years old as noted above.
Patients who needed close medical attention were more likely to have other diseases and were significantly older than others (median age 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a predictive factor for outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus infects men more than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as previously reported.
Problems: COVID-19 patients who require intensive medical attention are more likely to have acute cardiac disease or cardiac arrhythmia.
Cardiovascular events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes which may cause jaundice in COVID-19 patients.
It is argued that age and underlying disease are genetically linked and may interfere.
Lab results: Levels of C-type response protein (CRP) in the blood indicate the severity of the infection or tissue damage and are a predictor of underlying cause of disease, drug reaction, and eventual recovery.
The relationship between CRP levels and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been suggested.

Klinikal na Symptoms:Pregnancy and complications of COVID-19 should be considered with chest X-ray and timely progression of clinical symptoms and other issues.
Steroid use: As mentioned earlier, steroids are immune system suppressants and are often taken as an adjunct to infectious diseases to reduce the potential for infectious damage.

Therefore, if necessary, it should be taken in low-steroid diet and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.
Depression: As previously stated, during the COVID-19 pandemic many patients experience unusual anxiety as many have endured prolonged quarantine and extreme uncertainty and have witnessed the death of family members and friends.

According to the cross-sectional studies done so far, COVID-19 has different modes of transmission compared to SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 can also effectively reproduce in the upper respiratory system and may be mild or asymptomatic in the early stages of infection, as are other coronaviruses that cause a common cold.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
SARS-CoV is transmitted in a way that prevents infection, whereas most transmission does not occur in its early stages.

The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the decline will take 4-3 months.
Though, some experts are not very optimistic.
Paul Hunter and colleagues estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be far more devastating than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues created a comprehensive model to predict the outcome of this disease, and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus could infect two-thirds of the world's population.

It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, this SARS-CoV-2 will become less infectious and eventually die or mutate into a less pathogenic virus and remain with humans.
A comparison of the prevalence of COVID-19 with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by the cochlea, and possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been detected in feces, which suggests a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A new study of 138 cases shows that 41% of cases may have been hospitalized, with 17 patients having pre-existing conditions and 40 being health care workers.

The first line of defense that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection is the use of face masks; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirators (Chain No. 1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent the transmission of droplets from an infected individual via the air or contact with the surface of objects from where they can be transmitted to other people.
Though this is true, only N95 masks (chain number 1860) can protect against inhalation of small viruses of 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of viruses can be completely spread; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and is about 85 nm.

Healthcare workers should wear face shields and eyeglasses when working with patients.

Two feet is a reasonable distance from a sick person.

Though SARS-2 coronavirus came as a new virus to the world's population, it bears many similarities to SARS coronavirus discovered on 7/1/2020.It should have been a major cause of changes in China depending on the in-depth information of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the Wuhan International Center for Disease Control (WICD) has not reassured the public by saying that the virus has a low rate of transmission and is limited in its spread from person to person, and that there is no problem in preventing the disease.
The message effectively calmed the panic and anxiety of the people, especially as the whole country prepared for the Spring Festival, and the momentum was lost to controlling and limiting the disease to the minimum in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies and institutions may learn from this and make better progress in the future.
For example, such agencies and institutions should (1) be more vigilant when issuing public statements, as every word to their neighbours can change their decisions and behaviour; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to anomalous information from Norings, rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and official parties; (3) be more aggressive in limiting and controlling the epidemic in its early stages rather than reassuring; and (4) conduct more effective and active activities and training to raise public awareness about pandemics and response systems and to test and respond well to the community.
The outbreak of coronavirus-19 is caused by a new virus called SARS-CoV-2 that started in December 2019.

COVID-19 is affecting more elderly than younger, and men more than women, with higher infection and death rates in older than younger people.
SARS is more deadly than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
Patientes de COVID-19 transmiten el virus incluso cuando no presentan síntomas, mientras que los pacientes de SARS transmiten el virus cuando están en estado de enfermedad, lo que supone un mayor reto para prevenir y limitar la propagación del COVID-19 que para el SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
A standard RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovering patients can catch the virus again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.

SARS-CoV-2 originated from where?
Though there is 96% of the shared gene between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses such as bat SARS, we cannot say that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
What animal was the intermediate for transmitting the virus from the original host, say the bat to humans?

The outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome, also known as SARS, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, also known as MERS, has been a catalyst that has shown that being infected with a variant of HCoV can be devastating and life-threatening.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 re-emerged the coronavirus and boosted circulation with its high transmission capacity, but lower incidence than SARS-CoV-2.
HCoVs are transmitted from animals to humans, and understanding the animal-related origins of HCoVs can be useful.
Most HCoVs originated in bats, whereas they are not pathogenic.
HCoVs are known host cells.
Identifying host animals is a direct contribution to the prevention of human diseases.

About two-thirds of the genes contain 2 large open-frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are transcribed as: pp1a and pp1ab enzymatic diversity proteins.
Protein diversity is more likely to use non-basal protein 16, denoted nsp1~16.
The remaining portion of the gene contains ORFs for protein-containing structures, which include the S-head, E-sheet, M-sheet, and N-nucleotide.
A number of the same core proteins have been modified by different core strains of CoVs.

Of course, it was widely accepted that infection with the coronavirus strain was generally preventable until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating in history, infecting over 8,000 people, with a mortality rate of approximately 10%.
10 years later, the outbreak of the "Middle East respiratory syndrome syndrome" (MERS) has led to a persistent pandemic in the Arabian Peninsula with a steady spread around the world.
The 2019 coronavirus, (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the ongoing 2019 COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, which has killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.

In particular, we describe the general form of the coronavirus, which is not pathogenic in its host nature, but becomes pathogenic after it is transferred to a new host.
We also talk about the evolution of the coronavirus, where increasing transmission rates, always parallels decreasing hospitalization rates.
The continuing spread of SARS-CoV-2 is also discussed in the document.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.

A summary of the history of coronavirus detection in chronological order (Table 1) provides information and guidance.
The first case of HCoV-229E was isolated in 1966 in patients with respiratory distress syndrome, and subsequently developed in WI-38 lung cells.
HCoV-229E patients had normal symptoms, including headache, nausea, fatigue and diarrhea, with chronic symptoms seen in 10~20% of patients.
Then in 1967, HCov-OC43 was isolated from the brain stem and brain pathway of mammalian mice.

Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, primarily transmitted in the winter in cold climates.
The life cycle of these viruses is typically less than a week, followed by about two weeks of infection.
According to a volunteer study, healthy individuals with advanced HCoV-229E who have a cold
Only a few patients with severe immunodeficiency will experience respiratory ventilation.
SARS, also known as the invisible pneumonia, was the first well documented HCoV to cause an epidemic in human history, and SARS-CoV was the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS was reported in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
SARS was the outbreak of 8096 cases with 774 deaths spread across countries and continents.

SARS-CoV-2 patients initially experience muscle soreness, headache, nausea, and dizziness followed by nausea, cocaine, and nausea-like symptoms as final symptoms.
Lymphonia, patients with liver-command test disorders and elevated urea nitrogenation, is a common laboratory abnormality for SARS.
Sars patients experience lung pain, widespread spotting and increased macrophage.
About 20% to 30% of patients will later require intensive care and artificial ventilation.

HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a seven-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young and older children as well as in immunocompromised patients with inflammatory diseases.
Chorosis and pink eye rashes and nasal mucus rashes are commonly caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study reported extraction of the same virus from a sample of an 8-month-old baby who was suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.

The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to SARS in that it has the development of acute pulmonary fibrosis.
Unlike SARS, most MERS patients also suffer from renal hypertension, which distinguishes MERS from HCoVs.
Over 30% of patients have nervous system symptoms, including nausea and vomiting.

SARS-CoV-2 as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV causes severe lung infections in the presence of toxin, cocaine and respiratory infections.
Some patients get the birthmark.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop rapidly and become respiratory synapses.

SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and Mars-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is reportedly asymptomatic and may be contributing to its rapid spread worldwide.
By comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with all six other COVID, similarities and differences emerge that are noteworthy.
First, the life cycle and survival of HCoVs are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 is second only to the general trend of all six HCoVs.
Second, the severe symptoms of COVID-19 lie between SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 patients exhibit characteristics commonly seen in HCoVs, including moderate to severe symptoms and even absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small group of COVID-19 cases can be seen in SARS-CoV-2 cases, although the rate is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows the most striking examples of the characteristics of both HCoVs and community-acquired SARS-CoV.
On the other hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as the rate of HCoVs received by the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 reduces the likelihood of transmission to humans as in the cases of SARS-CoV and Mars-CoV.
Finally, the same as HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in urine samples.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It is also a matter of debate whether SARS-2 can be seasonal as well as community-acquired HCoVs.

All four HCoVs received by the community will produce moderate symptoms that humans have adapted well to.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four types of HCoVs.
Alternatively, both could survive the traditional HCoV strain.
HCoVs that cause human disease and those in which HCoVs have been isolated have been eliminated.

The longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts, the more vulnerable humans will be, and the more chance there will be for humans to fully adapt.

For several years, all four types of Coke collected by the community are delivered to the population.
These viruses don't need a hardware store.
The most common causes of illness caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and are not transmitted to humans.
They need to be present and spread in their biological warehouses and seek to be spread for human purposes, which may be through one or more intermediaries and the enlargement of host communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is similar to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and to all four community-acquired HCoVs.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It remains to be seen whether it fully adapts to humans and spreads within the human body without a storehouse or host of organisms.

A host organism for HCoVs can develop if it is isolated from a precursor that is closely related to it and exchanges homology at the nucleotide chain level.
The virus's ancestors always adapt well and are not transported to the host.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In both cases, host cells are naturally infected and host cells for HCoVs or for the parent virus.

This salt cell interface can serve as a source of biofilm for human infection and also plays a role in enlarging the salt cell by allowing the virus to multiply in a short period of time and then transfer to humans to increase the risk of human infection.
HCoVs can cross the infection barrier if they cannot support their own transmission within the amniotic membrane.
HCoVs can also adapt to moderate salinity and can even make room for themselves for long periods of time.
In this case, the central salt cell becomes the natural carrier salt cell.
The data shown below are a form of SARS-related biochemical data.
Analisis de casos demuestra que el transmisor anticovirus lgG está más extendido que entre la población general. Análisis de casos demuestra que el transmisor anticovirus lgG está más extendido que entre la población general.
The palm-masked cat (Paguma larvata) and the stray dog that live in the markets of Agilan, were initially thought to transmit SARS-CoV as viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no SARS cases were reported in the markets after all the Paguma larvae had been destroyed.

It is estimated that 80% of the varieties of shrimp in Guangzhou markets have received anti-SARS-CoV antibiotics, and that the small mammals' varieties may serve as an intermediate in increasing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
All of these appear to be the end of the SARS-CoV virus.
What makes the study different is that it removes the stigma on the nature of SARS-CoV-2 related bats, the term SARS refers to the Rhinolous-CoV HKU3 (SARSr-RH-BatCoV HKU3) bats that exist in bats from Horseshoe, China.
This species of bat is positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-RH-BatCoV HKU3 gene sequence.
This and other bat covers share 88-92% of the nucleotide chain with SARS-CoV.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS coronavirus receptor.
WIV1 was isolated from bat feces samples which showed that ACE2 is used by bat, cat, and human larvae as a receptor for cell entry.
Most importantly, the serum for the recovery of SARS patients is able to inhibit the functioning of WIV1.
WIV1 thus shows the closest pre-coronavirus SARS association in bats, with a 95% nucleotide spread in the equator.

Analisis genome of MERS-CoV groups for the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, DPP4, for virus entry.
The Mers-Cove RNA-associated RNA polymerase chain is biologically closer to the similar coronae of the Blind Saturn found in Europe and Africa.
To date, no Mars-Cove has been detected in the wild bat.
Mars-Cov and its COVID-HKU25-related equivalents share only 87 percent of the nuclear chain.
However, Blind Saturdays may not be able to leave a Mars-Cove fast food.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that monocotyledonous rabbits have unique antiviral antibodies to Mars-Cov, similar to those of Middle Eastern rabbits and native to several regions of Africa.
Mas-CoV has now been identified and isolated from single-celled mosquitoes that are likely to be infected by respiratory tract, further demonstrating that they are host to SARS-CoV.
It was also noted that symptoms were generally moderate but that widespread transmission of the virus was observed in the Mars-Cov-infected population.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Though, rats still exist since many Mars cases have been recorded and there have been no encounters with previously symptomatic rats, the source appears to be human-to-human transmission or the Mars-Cove involvement of small unidentified animal transfers.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% nucleotide homology to the COV-RaTG13 isolated bat from the Rhinelopus uniform bat.
As in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, differentiation modulation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is very good for family relationships.
As you said, it is likely that blind bats are not immediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 until known bats are found in the future.
It is thought that, at an advanced stage, the animal host for SARS-CoV-2 should be sold or killed among the mountain animal populations in the Hunan seafood wholesale brand, with the early cases of COVID-19 supported by the complete phenomenon of animal-to-human transmission.
Some of the studies that have been done on metagenomic regulation have suggested that a group of subgenic mammals known as pangolins (Mains javannica) may also be associated with SARS-CoV-2.
Cov genotypes of these newly discovered proteins show 85-92% sequence of nucleotide equivalence with SARS-CoV-2.
They are evenly related to RATG13 for 90% of the known nucleotide sequence.
They place two age lines for both SARS-CoV-2 as a virus in the genetic tree, one of which is the most commonly expressed RBD receptor with SARS-CoV-2, with 97% of the amino acid identifier remaining intact.
In complete contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RBD and RaTG13 are very different, although a higher degree of genome similarity is widely observed.
Previous studies on pangolin disease have also led to infection with viral DNA fragments from lung samples, which have been found to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
This study incorporated different methods and individual observations for genome sequencing, which accounted for 86.3% of the total viral genome collection.
We can't ignore that pangolin is a good host for SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no evidence yet to determine the primary source of the pangolin SARS-CoV-2 virus despite the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 co-infection.

SARS-CoV-2 development in bats, pangolins and other mammalian species is mediated by diffusion.
The relatively high sequence similarity found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 release the highest genome-wide sequence similarity.
It is generally believed that the high degree of similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 beta-associated pangolin RBDs and SARS-CoV-2 is assumed to be self-selective-compounded evolution.
The claim of a positive association between SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the tertiary mountain animal.
As an evolving force, fusion is widespread among beta-CoVs.
The evaluation panel is still outside the SARS-CoV-2 zoning.

History of evolution has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCOv-229E are of bat-derived origin, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 family viruses have been detected in rodents.
It has been suggested that bat corona virus known as ARCoV.2 (Coronavirus Antibody Program) has been detected in North America where it is seen in the form of a bat closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCo-229E has long been associated with another bat, Kove, named Hipposidores/Khanekwan/19/2008. It was discovered in Ghana during the Hustark era and was suspected to be a central host.
For clarity, the most recent information on the origin of the strains known as HCoVs is summarized in Form I and Table II.
The evolutionary history analysis has identified the occurrence of transgenic HCoVs in history.
When HCo-OC43 was transferred from organisms to humans via the domesticated tick in the late 1890s, a widespread respiratory illness was recorded.

Alpha-CoVs are very closely related to the HCO-229E that has been discovered.
Among them is the Cove-Alpa Alps.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
First, humans, unlike alpacas (a sheeplike animal with larger legs) may have had exposure to blind bats in a more symmetrical environment.
Rather, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, H-coronavirus-229E is related to bat coronavirus in a very different way and is not pathogenic to bats, whereas alpha-coronavirus strains are responsible for the spread of respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha alpine coronavirus has not been detected in rodents.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In fact, cockroaches are a direct source of human viral diseases such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, mumps virus and HANDRA virus.
It is therefore not surprising that HCoV-229E can be transmitted directly to humans.
On the other hand, whereas bat-coronavirus alpha acts as a gene pool for H-coronavirus-299E, the attached alga and vesicle may act as a central salt cell that transmits viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-COV.
MERS-KOV serves as the perfect model for the transmission of a half-species, from bats to unicorns and from unicorns to humans.
The origin of the evolution of MERS-COV in bats has been known since its identification and has been confirmed by subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that bats are a rich reservoir of virus species for species-to-species switching and interspecies transmission.
Ageing, the frequency of invasions, the combination of close proximity to a strong flight capability, all of these factors make bats a "virus vector".
Trouble, MERS-COV has been identified as a single-celled organism for decades.
It is well adapted to algae transformed from a central salt cellar to a stable and natural food store.
MERS-COV causes a very mild disease with a low rate of DNA mutation in these animals.
Transmission of the pathogen to humans is accidental, humans eventually becoming a dead MERS-COV cell, when transmission cannot continue.

In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs is a high risk factor for pangolin disease.
They may eventually become a dead host for SARS-CoV-related beta coronaviruses, similar to civets in the SARS-CoV context.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
First, bats can carry a host for SARS-CoV-2 related virus which is very unique to SARS-CoV-2.

Second, pangolins may be the growth cell hub of the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 related virus.

Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 re-integration may have occurred in a third species that had both bat and penguin exposure.
The search for the SARS-CoV-2 protozoan is ongoing.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
First of all, the average cross-sectional rate of RNA binding is high.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated toxicity of COVs ranges from "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate - 10-4 replications per year per site. It has reached the stage of adaptation of COVs to new host cells.
The Covars have evidence-based Xoribon Classi (RNA ribonuclease inhibitor enzyme), wherein the deletion of any of the outcomes is either highly variable and debilitating or non-functional.
In particular, nucleotides-like remdesivars are known to inhibit the coronaviruses by blocking entry into the outer nucleus and RNA-dependent and RNA-activating enzymes.
Remdesivir is one of the SARS-CoV-2 breaking virus antivirals being tested in the Laboratory Testing Unit.
Though, the average jump rate for COVID is approximately one million times higher than for the average.
Though, the jump averages are often higher when Covid is not well adapted to hostels.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It is thought to have adapted similarly to other host cells close to humans.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Theoretically, a different subset where the genetic drift leads to the development of a vaccine and antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 is a non-functional subset.
Second, the large RNA genome in the coronavirus makes more effort to adapt than the modified genome to jump and recombine, and therefore more likely to evolve into coexistence, which is beneficial for the recombining of new covid when conditions improve.
This is supported by the unique peer-reading framework and the way the protein works on coding in the final third of the genome.
Third, covids continuously randomly change their shape during RNA division by a 'selection-replication'-specific mechanism.
In a host that serves as a fusion vessel, a jump occurs when the RNA is copied from the host.
RNAs with long, subgenomic equivalents may reassemble to form new COVID.
Evidence of phylogenetic re-aggregation has been found in both HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, such as animal coronaviruses such as bat SL-COV and bat COV-HKU9.

RBDs in COVID S protein bind to cell membranes and are specifically selected by host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is based on 318 to 510 amino acids on the S1 subunit, which binds to human ACE2 as an excuse for the virus to enter the host.
SARS-CoV-2 RBDs can recognize ACE2 derivatives in various animals, including bats, civets, mosquitoes and raccoon dogs, allowing for transmission of the extinct viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been identified that are distinct from human and CIV-RBD isolates, and 4 of these were localized on receptor-receptor-interacting ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV-2 has a jump from RBD's K479N and S487T, which may enhance the interaction of the spike protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
Alternatively, alternatives to these two amino acids may be critical for the virus' suitability for humans.
It is plausible that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell cycle as SARS-CoV.
30% gap between SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV-1 in the S1 unit of the S protein that shares the corresponding transcription of the S protein with the human ACE2 that has been modified.
actually, EM cryo studies show that the probability of this binding is 10 to 20 times higher than that of human ACE2 and S ARS-KOVS proteins.
It's also important to know if any of the co-receptors are required to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, the NL63 coronavirus also fuses with ACE2 but with a different S component.
There are other H-coronavirus receptors, such as the amino-peptidase N enzyme for H-coronavirus 229E, as well as 9-O-sialic acid for H-coronavirus-OC43.
They may be responsible for the successful reception of CoVs in humans following this interspecies transmission from infected animals.

The spread of host proteins between humans and the natural host sites of the coronavirus, such as bats, camels and rodents, may create a barrier to transmission between species.
Coronaviruses must invade the host's autonomic factor and block the host's limiting factor, in order for intercellular transmission to be successful.
In this regard, the chemical resistance of the important area, where the virus is present and exposed, is identified and described.
A large, neutral variant of the gene responsible for the isolation and restriction of the host for SARS-CoV-2 using state-of-the-art CRISPR genetic technology may be produced.
Coronavirus fusion: Back to basics
The variation and diversity of bat-like coronaviruses gives a good chance of HCoVs convergence.

For example, the gain or loss of a protein-rich cell has the potential to manipulate the mass of a large sample.
Among the similarities of the SARS-CoV proteins, ORF8 has been shown to mutate and come to humans, where SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been isolated but found to mutate to ORF8 protein.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 29-nucleotide-dead in isolates at the beginning of the pandemic.
The staining, ORF8 divides into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a mutation that improves host cell metabolism.
Also, SARS-CoV has a history of cross-linkage with alpha and gamma coronaviruses, which have a greater number of regulatory regions in RNA-binding RNA polymers.
The locations of these configurations were identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and a subset of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV pandemic has been shown to have experienced a different setup at different times, which occurred in Saudi camels.

It should be noted that artificial detection can be an unwanted and widespread mutation of genes, which is likely to result in the spread of the virus in a specifically targeted area, such as the body's immune system.
An example of such effects is the complete loss of ORF4 of the primary coronavirus-229 E, leading to 2-nucleotide deficiency and blackout.

In contrast, carriers that are characterized by immune system responses, are isolated from CoV multiplication and replication.
The same strategy of blocking the immune response may be effective for immunization against SARS-CoV-2.
The response rate of the cell proteins that express the virus is very strong in bats.
Thus, the administration of cell-derived proteins, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, should be beneficial.
The activity of the NLRP3 protein diversity, however, is not complete in bats.
Logically, the presence of the NLRP3 multivariate protein with MCC950 could be useful for the treatment of coronavirus.
Sars-CoV-2 fusion brings the new form, which gives rise to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

They remain in their natural habitat, until they have a chance to spread.

Continued monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the environments of CoVs and their natural habitats, which has proven beneficial in preventing transmission from animals to humans and the future of their spread.
Ultimately, the most effective way to prevent animals from transmitting disease is for humans to stay away from environments where animals carrying viruses are native.
Some animal-derived puzzles of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.

According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), to ensure that a suspected case must combine each of the epidemiological history feature items with two clinical symptom items to perform a comprehensive analysis, or it must include three clinical symptom items if the epidemiological history is not clear:
History of epidemic: (1) History of travel or residence in Wuhan and its environs, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 have been reported within the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (2) History of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infectious case (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) History of exposure to patients with up to or symptoms of respiratory distress in Wuhan and its environs, or other communities in which COVID-19 has been reported within the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (4) History of exposure to a group of confirmed cases (>= 2 cases with up to and/or symptoms of respiratory distress occurring within 2 weeks in a small location, such as a home, office, school, etc.).
Clinical signs: (1) respiratory symptoms and/or symptoms; (2) with the characteristics of radiation exposure to COVID-19; (3) white blood cell count that indicates normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte count in early onset.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We can see that real-time PCR testing for respiratory nucleic acid or blood samples was added to Volume 2 (January 18, 2020) and Volume 3 (January 22, 2020).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
These modifications were based on the researchers' ongoing work to find a nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, with respiratory pathway samples including blood samples, which increased the availability of differential samples, and supported positive antibody-specific results within assured parameters.

, need to update the Zhou et al. chart, because they counted people who had no clinical symptoms as being "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be tested in clinical practice and further research.
As a result, we hope more direct evidence will be available and we invite readers to contribute their comments.

Our team will update our guidelines to provide assistance.

CBS reported that more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday from coronavirus infection, based on data from Johns Hopkins University.
Worldwide, countries have announced more drastic measures to stop the spread of the disease.


The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the vote was 215 for, 10 against, and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extends curfew in holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the entire day; previously, curfew was only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWayne announced that the state had extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Australia: Stores are reducing the amount of toilet paper in every transaction


These restrictions were posted as a message on the doors and the series' Facebook page.
It was reported that customers were buying more because of the fear of COVID-19 in case people needed to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Wolverines restricted the purchase of toilet cleanser to home delivery to only one package per order.
These changes followed the previous four-package restrictions announced by Wolverines and Coles on 4 and 5 March.
Coles, in his media release on 8 March, stated that the implementation of the four-package restriction, "still sold out in the majority of stores within one hour of delivery", and called the request "unforeseen", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unforeseen".

Last week, Costco in Canberra changed the allowable amount to two packages.
To balance the shortage, Coles requested more packages from suppliers and increased delivery times, Woolors requested more supplies, while ALDI dispensed its supplies for an early availability scheduled for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, CEO of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers are trying to increase the volume of goods, but local council restrictions on the timing of truck deliveries are making it difficult.
It predicts higher production costs, as suppliers attempt to meet demand, and with less specialization.


He noted that the toilet clenchy is a volume item, which results in a small amount of items in terms of numbers, and, when sold, makes a shelf too empty, making it difficult to feel deprived.
According to ABC News, Zimmerman said that Coles and Woolworths have a view[] that if there is a lot of stock on the shelves, if products like toilet cleanser and deodorant are [purchased] and quarantined, then you might reduce the fear.
The manufacturer of the recycled toilet cleanser Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they were out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes Kleenex toilet cleanser and Sorbent solar paper, emphasized that they worked 24/7 to preserve supply, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some home sellers were offering free toilet cleaning to first time bidders of add-ons in Melbourne, when fewer add-ons were made as sellers had more time during Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily print newspaper in Darwin, included eight pages of content to be cut and used as toilet paper.

We are very concerned about the high levels of spread and severity and the significant levels of non-conformity.
According to Dr. Tom Friedin, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unpredictable".
He said, in some reporting by CNN in the February issue, "Apart from influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced back to emergence until the ongoing global outbreak".
Gebreuse shared similar thoughts, saying "We've never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before".
He added, "And we've never seen a pandemic before that could be controlled at the same time".
The new status as a global pandemic follows the decision by WHO in January to declare the pandemic a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the United States Institute of Allergy and Epidemiology, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "In short, it looks like it's getting worse".

Around the world, authorities have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, traffic bans, trace hazard controls, and closures of facilities.
The pandemic has led to a global socio-economic disruption, postponement or rejection of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies due to over-investment.
Schools and universities are closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.

Health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei Province) reported a batch of pneumonia cases on 31 January 2019, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.

The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus related to the bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, SARS-CoV. The first known person to have symptoms and then become ill was on 1 January 2019, the person was not identified by the Fresh Meat Market Association.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Monring Post suggested that a case dating back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old man in Hubei Province, may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization said that, with new cases declining in China, but suddenly rising in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, for the first time the number of new cases outside China has exceeded the number of new cases within China.
A significant number of cases may go unreported, particularly among those with mild symptoms.

Cases refers to the number of people who have been vaccinated for COVID-19, and who have been confirmed to have tested positive according to official protocols.

A study published on 16 March concluded that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had gone undetected, and these unrecorded infections accounted for 79% of the reported cases.

The initial estimate of the production number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a rating of 5.7.
Most people who have COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may involve people who have died being screened - for example, in elderly cells, etc.

A spokesperson from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that "we know that [the reported death toll] is a low prediction", a statement along with one-by-one reports of non-compliance in the United States. Often this undercounting occurs during pandemics, such as the 2009 N1H1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.

These figures vary by region and time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and general health. The death rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases detected over a given period.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.

Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine predicts that the overall mortality rate for the pandemic will be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above estimate is consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzes the effect of the test on the CFR predictions.
The World Health Organization reiterates that the pandemic is manageable.
The latitude and longitude of the extinction are not clear and may vary by location.
"Without testing, epidemics are generally high and then start to decline when the disease no longer has available hosts", said Massey Bonney from Penn State University.
"n't possible to predict right now when that's going to happen".

On March 17, Adam Kocharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will be around for a year or two".
According to the Imperial College Open Leadership study by Neil Ferguson, social distancing and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus - because it's so transmissible - will be completely gone" and "it's likely to be a seasonal disease, coming back every year".
The severity of the spin is dependent on the mass resistance and the rate of jump.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively undetectable and infected individuals may not have symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are ta (88%) and dry cough (68%).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies acute burden symptoms as: difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden fluidity, difficulty walking, and facial or lip blue-blue; immediate medical attention is required if these symptoms are present. Further exacerbation of the disease can lead to acute pneumonia, acute concomitant pressure of the respiratory system, toxicity of the blood and death.
Some cases may be asymptomatic, with no clinical signs but with test results confirming infection, so researchers have advised that those who have close contact with infected individuals should be closely monitored and screened to rule out infection.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) is 1 to 14 days; the most common is 5 days. As a non-specific example, the estimated proportion of those with COVID-19 who have lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and then dropped to 15%.

The disease is believed to have been spread primarily during close contact and small bursts during cooking, smoking or talking; close contact is typically 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 ft).
The researchers concluded that the cocaine deposited causes the spray to be transported by 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some have suggested that the virus may be transmitted via small droplets that remain in the air for long periods of time, which may be formed during speech. Respiratory droplets may also be formed during breathing, including speech, although the virus is not usually transmitted through the air.
The droplets can be inhaled from the mouth or nose of close relatives or inhaled into the lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause the pulmonary secretions to leak into the air and thus cause airway discharge.
It can also be spread when a person touches a dirty face, touches the skin, and then touches their eyes, throat or mouth.

The Chinese government has denied the possibility of blood-borne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most prevalent during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although outbreaks may occur before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.

There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend washing hands after touching animals, such as after contact with surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, first isolated from three people who had acute pulmonary infection in a group of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 has all the characteristics of a related coronavirus. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which coats its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
He is believed to have an animal ancestry.
Analisis umum telah menunjukkan bahwa koronavirus secara genetik bersatu dengan gen betacoronavirus, yaitu dengan subgenus sarcocoronavirus (Line B) bersama dengan dua steren yang berasal dari bat.
96% is similar to the genetic level of other bat coronavirus (BatCov TaTG13) samples.

A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is more robustly sensitive than PCR, with less specificity, with characteristics of radiation that are incompatible with other processes of pulmonary infection and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for testing or as a first-line test for detecting COVID-19".
The World Health Organization has published several protocols for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.
The test uses real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on a breath sample or blood sample.
Results are usually available in a few hours to a few days.
The test is usually performed on the nasal-thoracic swab, although a splenic swab may also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological testing, which detects antibodies.

In the United States, serological testing was developed by Cellex and approved for emergency use only by trusted laboratories.

The Italian Radiological Society maintains an online database of radiological results of confirmed cases.

A large study in China compared CT results to PCR and showed that although radiation is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it should be considered as a screening tool in epidemic areas.

This means that the virus can spread within communities, and members of some communities may not know where or how they were infected. Health care providers care for a person who may have been infected who is instructed to use standard early warning and exposure watch and eye protection. Tracking exposure is an important way for health authorities to identify the source of the disease and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and over 100 other organisations providing explanations and calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.

Users will then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions have spread about how to prevent infection; for example, washing your nose and choking with mouthwash is not effective.

Lavarse las manos se recomienda para prevenir la propagación de la enfermedad.
CDC recommends that people wash their hands early with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are clearly soiled; before eating; and after wiping the nose, using cocaine or pyjamas.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which inhibits its function.
CDC further recommends the use of a deodorant containing at least 60% deodorant when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The masks may be cleaned with a number of filters (within one minute of exposure to the detergent for the steel coating), including 62-71% isopropanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hydrochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% iodine-povidine.
Other compounds, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate crohexidine, are less potent.
CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in an institution such as an office or daycare, all locations such as offices, toilets, common areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by a patient should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and throat with a clen or clen during cocaine or pyjamas, and discarding the clen immediately.
Masks are recommended for those who may be infected with the virus, as wearing masks reduces the size and distance of the displaced droplets from the breath during speaking, coughing and sneezing.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines for when and how to wear masks.

The World Health Organization has recommended masks by healthy individuals if they are at high risk, such as those caring for a COVID-19 patient, although it acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid losing their faces.

In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks made of cloth. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by the healthy general public, especially during close contact (1 meter (3 ft) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded areas. Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded areas.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out without wearing a mask or masking their nose.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that anyone going to the store must wear a mask.
Israel asks all residents to cover their faces when they are in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, has required train and bus passengers to wear masks from 1 April.
Panama has mandated masks when outdoors, while recommending masks at home for those who cannot afford masks.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.

Individuals may practice social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, using non-confrontational greetings, and avoiding physical distancing from each other.
Most governments are now mandating or promulgating social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of the gathering was reduced by US government bodies and health organizations from 250 people (if there is no known COVID-19 outbreak in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure and immune problems are at higher risk for serious illness and have been advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible where community outbreaks have occurred. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health authorities began to change the use of the concept of "social distancing" to "physical distancing", to explain that the goal is to reduce physical exposure during social interactions, either metaphorically or remotely.
The use of the concept of "social distancing" meant that individuals should engage in complete social distancing, rather than being encouraged to stay in contact with others through alternative means. Some authorities issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
These include recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with, who is HIV positive or has no symptoms of HIV.
Self-isolation at home recommended for those who have COVID-19 and those who are suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued guidelines for self-isolation.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for all residents living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine guidelines are issued for those in high risk groups.
Those who may have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where there has been widespread transmission are advised to quarantine for 14 days following the last exposure.
Strategies in controlling an outbreak include containment or quarantine, and mitigation.

Prevention requires much more, with the goal of reversing the spread of disease from person to person to less than one part of management and dealing with an emergent outbreak of infectious disease is to try to reduce the peak of the outbreak by correcting the outbreak curve.
This reduces the risk of over-reliance on services and gives more time for vaccine and treatment development.

Other countries have also taken a series of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has implemented mass screening and local quarantine, and has issued warnings for the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore has provided financial support for those infected who have quarantined themselves and imposed severe penalties for those who fail to comply.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and imposed penalties for mass purchases of medical supplies.The same for Great Britain and the United States shows that mitigation (slowing down rather than stopping the spread of the epidemic) and containment (stopping the growth of the epidemic) are major challenges.

Quarantine may be considered acceptable but should be delayed until the virus circulates within the human community (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that is the case initially), as transmission will increase when measures are relaxed.

Taking anti-obesity medications, drinking fluids, and resting may help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intramuscular fluid, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of catalysts may worsen the results.

The World Health Organization also stated that some "topical and topical treatments" may provide relief for SARX-CoV-19 symptoms.

The ECDC and the WHO's European Regional Office have issued guidance for hospitals and primary health care services to shift resources at multiple levels, including shifting focus from laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, declining alternative arrangements whenever appropriate, isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and enhancing intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of hand-held respirators and beds available.

A March 2020 literature review found that "thoracic radiographs play a minor role in diagnosing the disease in its early stages. While detected on CT (computed tomography) scans may occur even before the initial symptoms".
Types on CT include a multi-degree double-glazed instrument and a geometric imaging instrument and a non-discrete instrument and back division.
Subplural dominance, insanity and stiffness disorders are treated as growth disorders.
A scientific study comparing PCR to CT in Wan at the epicenter of the current pandemic has suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, albeit less accurate, with characteristics distinguishing it from pulmonary fibrosis and pathology.

They can be used to test people within 7 days of infection onset or after the onset of early symptoms to determine immunity and in the diagnosis of disease in the brain. Tests can be performed in a CLT or by a Point of Care (PoCT) scan.
The high rate of automated systems in some medical laboratories is available to perform these tests but their availability depends on the average output per system.
For CLT, an external device blood test is most commonly used, however a series of samples can be used to delay the clotting response.
PoCT is a blood sample taken by piercing the skin.
Unlike PCR measures, a removal step is not required prior to testing. On 26/3/2020, the FDA released the names of 29 authorized authorities that had submitted notices to the regulator as requested and are now available to distribute their test antibodies.

The test is capable of taking a set of samples in an hour and is therefore faster than a standard PCR test for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the initial infection, and as of early April, the UK had not detected any laboratory antibodies, so it purchased antibodies that were safe to use.
Hong Kong has introduced a plan whereby suspected patients can stay at home, providing the emergency department with a syringe whereby patients can take samples, inject them and return them, and then receive the results of the screenings. The UK NHS has announced that they are piloting a plan to screen suspected patients at home, where they risk infecting others by the patient if they come to the hospital or need to use an ambulance. While vaccinating for suspected cases of COVID-19, a healthcare professional will take samples using appropriate screening.
South Korea has been assisted by delivery centres, which are conducting some of the fastest and most extensive screening in the country. In Germany, the International Union for the Regulation of Physical Health Insurance in 2/4 said it was able to perform 12,000 screening per day in its mobile work, and 10,700 screening was done in the previous week.
The costs are covered by the health insurance when the test is ordered by the doctor.
According to Robert Koch, President of the Institute, Germany has the capacity to perform over 160,000 tests per week.
On 19/3 a roaming test was offered in several major cities.

The first measurement laboratory shows that as of the 12/2020 week calendar, at least 483,295 samples had been broken and between the 12/2020 week and 33,491 which was (6.9%) positive for SARS-CoV-2, in Israel researchers at Teknion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a new method to test samples for 64 patients simultaneously, by collecting samples and testing detailed data on the probability of positive mixed samples. In the city, a temporary laboratory of 2000 meters of emergency research called "Ho-yan" was opened on 5/2/2020 by BGI, which can test 10,000 tests per day.

In March, due to the scarcity and lack of chemical glass, Mebarak glass was used for high-powered testing in Europe and the UK.
This led the authors to investigate the sample preparation protocol whereby samples were subjected to a temperature of 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to extract samples of RNA material for detailed analysis. On 31/3 it was reported that the United Arab Emirates was conducting more per-population coronavirus testing than other countries, and was working to raise the testing levels to the highest possible population level.
It was based on a combination of the ability to test vaginas and the purchase of laboratory equipment from 42 groups and BGI (backed by Hu-wan Emergency Testing Laboratories in Xin).

The World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the German idea of making testing kits and sent them to poor countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German idea was published on 17/2/2020, the protocol developed by the United Nations Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28/2, delaying the availability of tests in China and the United States There were problems with the reliability of testing kits at the beginning of the outbreak, these countries and Australia were unable to provide the testing kits needed to satisfy demands and orders for testing by health professionals.


On 16 March, the World Health Organisation called for increased vaccination programmes as the best way to monitor the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the United States, testing kits were developed online by the CDC which contained errors and then the government removed the legal barriers, which prohibited private testing. Spain purchased testing kits from Shenzhen Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not accurate.
The company explained that incorrect results may be due to sample collection errors or incorrect tooling.
The Spanish Ministry announced that it would return equipment that had failed, replacing it with various laboratory equipment supplied by Schengen Biotech. 80% of the laboratory equipment that the Czech Republic had purchased from Cine had failed. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million pieces of laboratory equipment from Cine that had been found to be inaccurate.
Slovakia's Prime Minister Matović suggested that they be removed to the Danube. Atis Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health stated that the Turkish laboratory equipment purchased from Sini was "highly defective", and "not used". The UK purchased 3.5 million laboratory equipment from Sini but announced in early April 2020 that they were not for use.

Researchers worked on the Italian city of Vue, where the first deaths from COVID-19 were reported, and conducted two tests for the entire population of about 3,400 people, over a ten-day period.
Almost half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases were quarantined.
Traveling to specific areas, he did not leave completely new cases.

Most countries have implemented isolation and suspension of travel, testing and quarantine to deal with the pandemic, but without strict travel restrictions like Iceland and South Korea.

The World Health Organization states that countries that do not have the capacity to conduct testing and national laboratories with COVID-19 experience should send the first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO laboratory sources for testing confirmation.
Of the 16 laboratory sources, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America, and 1 is in Australia.

A country that only tests those who are hospitalized has a higher rate of positive outcomes than countries that screen all populations, whether they have symptoms or not, the rest is the same.

The primary medical purpose of handwashing is to clean the hands of microbes (bacteria, viruses, or other microbes that can cause disease), and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who cook or work in a medical area, but it is also an important practice for public places.

In developing countries, the average infant mortality is associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases which can be reduced by introducing different behaviors such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate in those countries by almost 50%.

48% reduction in chain diarrheal diseases can be attributed to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is one of the most effective and cost-effective ways to prevent cough and Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI), as an automated practice in homes, schools and communities worldwide.
Tuberculosis, a major component of ARI, is the number one cause of death in children under five years of age, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths per year.
Diarrhoea and dysentery together cause the deaths of approximately 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, the practice of washing hands with soap before eating and praying before going to the toilet with a persistent touch can save more lives than all medical treatments, preventing deaths from diarrhea by 50% and preventing deaths from acute respiratory disease by one in four.

Alcohol-based detergents are used to kill bacteria, bacteria resistant to many antibacterial agents (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and certain viruses (including HIV and STDs, RSV and RHV, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
70% alcohol-containing detergent kills 99.97% (reduction by 3.5 logarithms, equivalent to 35 reductions per unit volume) of bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4-5 logarithms of reduction) of bacteria on hands one minute after application, hand sanitizer is more effective against bacteria and less aggressive against virus.
Alcohol hand sanitizer is not effective against the most commonly transmitted (or norovirus) strains of the virus, which can cause the development of a foot and mouth disease.A cleanser or a laxative should be used to wash or wipe hands thoroughly.
The front and back of both hands and between and end of all fingers are wiped for 30 seconds until the liquid, mucus, or liquid material is removed.
The tips of the fingers should also be neatly washed and worn through the palms of the hands. The United Nations Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing prior to hand washing with liquid, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The prevalence of these substances depends on their ease of use and speed of killing of microbes, however, they should not serve as a substitute for hand washing unless soap and water are available.

The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or prevented by adding glycerin or other skin creams to the procedure.
In medical treatments, alcohol hand sanitizers contain skin creams that are less likely than soaps and antibacterial tanners to cause skin irritation or dryness.
Sensitivity to hand-held transdermal agents, high-throughput thermoplastics, or highly sensitive to alcohol or to the additives of laxatives is rare.

Alcohol's ability to clean hands relies heavily on ingredients and formulations, and has historically failed.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have sustained and accumulated antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to have a reduced effect after reuse, possibly due to a high degree of skin discomfort.
Many people in developing countries cannot afford their soap and use dust or ashes instead.
Dust or ash may be more effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if dust or ash is contaminated with microbes, it may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The World Health Organization recommended dust and ash as a substitute for soap when soap was not available.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the United Nations Centers for Disease Control to prevent transmission of disease includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with running hot and cold water.
Temperature of the water is not shown to make a difference.
Hand hygiene involves washing with soap, the back of the hands, and between the fingers and the soles of the nails.
Soap removes microbes from the skin, and scientific studies show that people prefer to wash their hands with soap than with water alone.
Rub your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds.

The washing went well with water.
Lavarse las manos en plato puede hacer que las manos se ensucien.
Wash in a clean cloth or let it air dry.
Wet hands get dirty easily, the most common places where dirt is dangerous are the horse's hoof, the blade, the area between the fingers and the fingernails.
Artificial nails and artificial nails may be places where microbes congregate.
Touch-softening skin fillers are recommended to protect hands from drying out, as dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the transmission of the infection.

The rise and popularity of handwashing with soap can influence policy making and raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing and become a long-term behavior in the population.

A systematic review of 70 scientific studies found that social approaches are more effective than handwashing promotion in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of handwashing promotion in schools is the Three Star Approach by UNICEF which encourages schools to adopt, for example, low-cost measures to ensure that students start washing with soap among other hygienic requirements.

The effects of hand washing on human health - particularly for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers with children or wounded soldiers in hospital - were first reported in the 19th century by two inventors of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the inventor of the English nursing method.

In the 1980s, dietary and infection-related disease awareness led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to increase the use of hand washing as a grinding method to stop infection transmission.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased awareness of the importance of handwashing with soap in many countries to protect individuals from infectious diseases.
For example, "Right-sharing handwashing techniques" posters were placed next to hand washers in public toilets and in office toilets in buildings and airports in Germany.
The term "hand washing" means declaring a person healthy to take responsibility for something or to commit to it.


It has been found that people who have thoughts of immoral behavior, turn to hand washing more than anything else, turn to hand washing equipment.
Though, those who are instructed to wash their hands after meditation are less likely to engage in other acts of hygiene, such as volunteering.

Hinduism, Judaism and Islam mandate washing hands after toilets.
Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews and Muslims also practice hand washing before and after eating.

Workplace harm controls for COVID-19 is a program to implement safety and health practices to control harm to prevent the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).



This includes workers who are in contact with the general public such as schools and high-end industrial work environments and some high-end aviation organizations.
To control the risks to these groups, as well as basic infection prevention measures, including air conditioning with advanced air filters and Pfizer protectors and having special protective equipment if a person has COVID-19.
OSHA considers health alert and morgue workers who are at high risk for COVID-19 to be at high risk, and the risk is significantly increased if the worker uses air conditioners or collects samples of suspected or infected COVID-19.

The COVID-19 outbreak can have many effects on the workplace.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Business partners may change the desired goods and the reason for demanding those goods (such as marketing at the time people come to the market or delivery or resale).
Recently, cargo ships in geographic areas damaged by COVID-19 may be detained. Preparedness for an infectious disease and survival planning can be used to perform protective actions.
Planes publish the risk levels associated with the workplace and work tasks, including sources of infection and associations of increased risk factors in the home and community and individual risk factors such as advanced age or chronic disease conditions.
They also outline the necessary controls to address the risks and contingency plans for situations that may increase the spread.
Infectious disease preparations and plans may be subject to national and subnational mandates.

The disease has been strongly impacted by the community in which it has been reported.

Engineering controls involve workers avoiding harm without relying on worker behaviour and can be the most proactive solution to implement.
Managerial controls are changes in the work ethic or steps that require action by workers.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and management controls, but can help prevent infection to a lesser extent.
All PPE types should be identified based on worker harm, appropriate classification such as applied (e.g. respiratory problems), appropriate warning, legal packaging, extended, tracked, as needed, appropriately removed, cleaned, stored or prepared to avoid contamination.
According to the United Nations Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupational hazard reduction is less associated with public and corporate workers.

The United Nations Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers who have symptoms of illness stay home until they are free from the wheel, wheel signals and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of sedatives or other medications, and when the disease situation subsides, allow workers to stay home to monitor sick family members, and workers who are aware of the measures.
According to OSHA, the central risk of work includes those who are in close or close contact with six feet (1.8 m) tall individuals who are not carriers or suspected of COVID-19, but may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 due to mass transmission or because the individual is traveling internationally to a place with COVID-19.
These include workers who are in contact with public places such as schools, industrial workplaces or shopping malls. Engineering controls for this and high-risk groups including the installation of advanced air filters and the increase in the frequency of air conditioners and the installation of medical barriers such as plastic kitchen protectors and the establishment of a delivery window service for customers. Management controls for this and high-risk groups include encouraging workers to stay home, tracking face-to-face encounters with electronically connected facilities, establishing shift switching and disrupting unwanted visits to workplaces or workplaces to prevent the spread of COVID-19, collecting information among workers, providing training and education and other ways to protect workers and workers from COVID-19 and other workplace hazards, and providing ideas and advice on how to protect workers and workers from COVID-19 and other workplace hazards.
Workers in this high-risk group are rarely asked to use respirators.

The COVID-19 pandemic is something that is making it impossible for our global social connections and responsibilities to be the same towards each other.
We have no precedent for its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on our brotherhood and our collaboration and our collective building which is the most important part of this process.
We see a sense of empathy and connection among all our friends in e-mail and phone calls and chat which is an incredible contribution of humanity that we are happy to use with them.

Last week, some people have been applauding me for our work.
They reminded me how much this means to the world to go to Wikipedia right now, how powerful symbols are to see it as an online resource and to make it available to everyone.
Your actions will make it happen, whether you cause the site to be blocked or pay our employees or burden our communities.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, now more than ever.
n't just time to think about what we do, but how we do it, to make a meaningful impact on the world.

Angiotensin-dependent enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is localized to the cell surface of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ACE2 inhibits the activity of the related angiotensin-containing enzyme by reducing the dose of angiotensin-twin and increasing Ang (((1-7), making it a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also provides a cell-entry gateway for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is most commonly expressed as hACE2.
Zinc-containing metal angiotensin is expressed on the inner surface of the walls of the tubules and other cells.
ACE2 protein is composed of the N-region transporter M2 peptide protein and the C-region transporter that binds to the dominant carrier amino acid.
ACE is a type I monoamine protein, with the enzyme active on receptor cells on the surface of lung cells as well as other tissues.
ACE2 is secreted by the major cell membrane and transported to the major protein, the enzyme P, called shades, where it becomes a polarised protein in the bloodstream and is significantly separated and excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is expressed by cell membranes, particularly in cyclin-dependent type 2 C cells, cells in the small intestine, the membrane of arterial and vascular cells, and in the vascular smooth muscle cells of most organs.
ACE2 mRNAs are also found in the frontal lobe, in the midbrain, deep within the brain, and in the brainstem.
ACE2's primary function is to balance ACEs.
ACE is the hormone that doubles angiotensin one to angiotensin two in the bloodstream.
ACE2 is converted during carboxyl-termial amino acid phenylalanine from anigotensin II (Asp-Arg-Bal-Tyr-IIe-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses into the vasodilator angiotensin (1 - 7, (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Lle-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also bind a number of other peptide bonds such as -[des-Arg9] bradykinin, apelin neurotensin, dynorp hin A, ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the natural amino acid amplifier SLC6A19 and is also found in Hartnap disease.
As a transporter protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, such as HcoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the transcription of the S1 strand of the SARS-CoV protein and SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 subunit on the cell surface results in the large-scale translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosome inside the cell.
It is speculated that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight the disease.
However, some professional associations and bodybuilders recommend continuing with ACE reduction standards and ARB treatment.
The Revised and Developed Analysis Form published on May 11, 2020, found "The use of ACE inhibitors was developed with a 34% significance in reducing the risk of side effects compared to controls".
"There was a lower risk of acute lung disease in patients treated with ACE inhibitors than increased risk of lung disease, particularly in those who had had a stroke and heart failure".
The use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with the management of water-associated pneumonia, although the results have been less healthy than the overall risk of pneumonia.
ACE2 (rhACE2) is proposed as a novel treatment for severe lung injury, and has been shown to reduce pulmonary hemorrhage and hypoxia in piglets with lipoposaccharide- successful in the treatment of severe respiratory symptoms.
ErhACe has a half-life of approximately 10 hours in humans with a 30-minute half-life of 24 hours.

The proposed plan by Google and Apple was intended to address the ongoing problem of monitoring by removing the monitoring mechanism from mobile operating systems when it was no longer needed.
Some countries use the Internet based on location monitoring instead of software, eliminating both the need to download a software, and the ability to disable monitoring.
In Israel, the Internet was monitored.
The Internet is based on a solution to the problem of accurate encryption of data in empty locations.

In South Korea, a non-software-based system was used to perform communications monitoring.
Rather than using a specific software, the system collected surveillance information from a variety of sources such as mobile device surveillance data and transaction card data, and combined these to generate a note in written letters to the hidden victims.

This information is made publicly available through a number of software and websites. Countries such as Germany have set up both data collection centres and privacy protection systems.

As of March 2020, there is one DNA-based MERS that has completed phase 1 clinical trials in humans, and three others are in development, all of which are viral-targeted pathogens, two are adeno-targeted (ChAdOx1-MERS and BVRS-GamVac), and one is MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Media outlets have published a theoretical plan to create a virus behind COVID-19 that was known to be available in the past.
The innovations were prompted by viral posts on social media that suggested the invention was a genetic function and a link to other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Common symptoms include coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time to onset of the initial symptoms is normally around five days but may vary from two to fourteen days.

While these tiny droplets are formed during breathing, they often fall to the ground or onto surfaces and are contracted from great distances.

The virus can persist on surfaces for more than 72 hours.

The use of masks is anticipated for those suspected of having the virus and their monitors.

Less commonly, symptoms of upper respiratory distress such as fever, cough or sore throat may be seen.
Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in the statistics.
Some cases of chest pain were initially only severe chest pain and rapid heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease may progress to pneumonia, damage two organs, and death.
This is called the onset of symptoms.
Five to six days may change to two to 14 days.
So, within 11.5 days of infection, reports indicate that not all infected individuals develop symptoms.
The role of asymptomatic carriers in the transmission of the virus is not yet fully understood, although preliminary evidence suggests that they may be the cause of the spread of the disease.
The proportion of patients who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of confirmed cases remain asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
The International Health Commission launched a report on asymptomatic cases of daily cases in 1/4: 166 infections on that day, 130 (78) asymptomatic during the course of the vaccination.
Both leak and vomit can carry large viral loads.

The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says that while it is generally not clear how quickly the disease spreads, it is possible for one person to infect two to three people. The virus can remain on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus is detectable for one day on cardboard, for more than three days on plastic (polymer flexible foam) and clean plastic, and for more than four hours on 99% copper.
However, heavy loads are dependent on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are effective if used correctly, soap products break the protective levels of viral fats, forcing them to release onto the skin and other surfaces.
Other treatments, such as chemical detergents and antiviral detergents (anti-inflammatory breakers), are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, leak samples were taken from a chart two days after the start of a hospital stay.
Five out of six patients, the first patient showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on day two of testing.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, first isolated in three people with cases of pulmonary disease associated with severe respiratory distress in Wan.
All of the novel SARS-CoV-2 viruses originate from related coronaviruses in nature.

The lungs are the most susceptible organs to COVID-19 infection because the virus enters the host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant type 2 alveolar cell of the lungs.
The virus uses a special glucose-like surface called a "peplomer" to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac failure was found in 12% of patients hospitalized in Wan, Xin, and is more likely to recur in severe illness.
The symptoms of cardiovascular disease are high, resulting in systemic fluctuations and immune system disorders, but heart muscle failure may be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are expressed in cardiac order.
High bleeding rates (31%) and blood clots (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with a lower chance of recovery.Analyses of people who died from COVID-19 have found prevalent alveolar alveolar damage and inflammatory lymph nodes.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a propensity for ACE2 respiratory epithelial cell expression, patients with severe COVID-19 infection have symptoms of systemic inflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF pathogen-secreting T cells have been shown to bind to IL-6-secreting monoclonal antibodies and acute pulmonary disease in COVID-19 patients.
The lymphocyte receptor is also reported in the anatomy.
WHO has published several screening protocols for the disease.
The standard method of detection is the anti-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is normally performed on respiratory samples obtained by nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasopharyngeal swab or a nasopharyngeal swab may be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.

Seni scientists who were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and distribute its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
As of 4/4/2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and if someone has been infected before) were in development, but sometimes the vaccine was not used.
The experience of the Sinees with the frying has shown that the accuracy is only 60% to 70%.
FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21/3/2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at the University of Wan suggested ways to detect infections based on medical ethics and epidemiological risk.

Treatments to reduce the chance of infection include staying home, avoiding violent situations, washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, good breathing practice and avoiding eye and nose contact with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when you cough or sneeze, and recommends using a diaper if a handkerchief is not available.
It is recommended to clean your hands after each cooking or smoking.
CDC has recommended the use of a face mask in public places, to limit transmission by asymptomatic persons. The social distancing plan aims to reduce contact by infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, suspending travel and denying large public gatherings.

CDC also recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are clearly dirty, before eating, and after wiping the nose, cocaine or pidgin.
It further recommends using an alcohol hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only when water and soap are not available. For areas where hand sanitizers are not available, the WHO proposes two rules for local production.
In those cases, the antibacterial activity is increased by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores from alcohol; this is "not an active ingredient for hand anti-inflammatory".
Glycerin was added as a moisturizer.

CDC recommends that those suspected of carrying the virus wear a plain mask.
Oxygenated extracorporeal membrane (ECMO) has been used to diagnose respiratory distress, but its benefits are still under investigation.
Personal hygiene and healthy living and food safety are predicted to boost immunity.
Therapies supportive may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the International Commission on Mental Health have published medical recommendations for monitoring people hospitalized with COVID-19.
United Nations medical observers and pulmonologists have collected treatment recommendations from viral receptors in a free package, IBCC.

For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol over ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in healthcare settings where performing procedures can create aerosols, such as putting on a ventilator or hand ventilator.

Recommended supplies: PPE chair, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. When available, respirators (instead of face masks) are recommended.
N95 air conditioners are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) supervision.
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for untested uses.

Most COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require ventilators or swabs, but a proportion do.

It is unknown whether each of these genes has the same benefits for people with serious illnesses.
Some doctors prefer to stay with a rapid-air conditioner if available, as this method limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a tracheotomy. Severe cases are more common in older people (those over 60, especially those over 80).

A scientific trial in Sin found that 5% were allowed to be in the care units, 2.3% needed ventilation support, and 1.4% died.

Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to be severely affected by COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to require special attention than nonsmokers.Caution has been raised about the long-term consequences of the disease.
Hong Kong Government Hospital has discovered a drug that can reduce the lung capacity of 20 to 30 people who have recovered from the disease, and also the lungs of the organs that have been damaged.
This may also lead to the importance of careful health care for later recovery.

Immunity is based on the behaviour of other viruses, but other cases that have recovered from COVID-19 are identified with positive coronavirus test results that are revealed in the next few days.
Tis believed that these cases are aggravated by prolonged infection with the possibility of recurrence.
The virus is thought to be natural and originated in animals, from the spirochondria.
The initial outbreak is unknown, but by January 2020 the outbreak was fully human-to-human.
The study of the first 41 cases of COVID-19, published in the Lancet in December 2020, has the earliest date of onset of visible symptoms as 1 January 2019.
The official release from WHO is scheduled for 8 December 2019.

These figures vary by region and time spent, and are influenced by the size of the screening, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, time from initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex, overall health.

According to Johns Hopkins University, the global death rate for the disease is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region, with other metrics such as the case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who have died from the disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed or undiagnosed) who have died from the disease.
These statisticians are not affected by time and do not look for a specific infected population when making decisions about cases.

At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) died.
"Gangelt", the disease spread through a carnival festival, spread among young people, caused a lower death rate, and not all COVID-19 deaths were classified as such".
Though, the German healthcare system has not yet improved.
In the Netherlands, 3% have antibodies, which are derived from blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) confirmed that they died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.

The greatest fear is for men in their 50s.
In China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8% and for women 1.7%.
The exact cause of gender differences is unknown, but genes and genetic morphology* may be involved.

In Europe, 57% of cases were men and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were men.

Research has shown that different viral diseases such as Ebola, influenza and SARS affect men and women.

The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO President Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO is the marker for coronavirus, VI for disease, and 19 for the time of the outbreak when it was first diagnosed: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen by avoiding denoting a specific geographical area (e.g. China).
WHO often uses "COVID-19 virus" in public discussions.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".

In January 2020, WHO suggested that 2019-nCov and 2019-coronavirus strongly spread as two temporary names for disease and virus in relation to the 2015 guidelines against the use of place names in disease and disease names.
The official names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Because of the size of the blocks according to Chinese ink standards, some digital fabrication engineers print health-critical items such as lead-sheet and parts of ventilator devices.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently requested ventilatory ventilators, and stakeholders were unable to deliver them in time as requested, a local reboot of the emergency ventilation system was implemented and ground to 100 requests for ventilators at night.

It is thought that humans are capable of transmitting the virus to some animals.
Scientific studies have failed to find evidence of duplication of the virus in pigs, sows and chickens.
No medication or formula has been approved for the treatment of the disease.

No formula is available, but different parties are actively producing candidate formula.

Tri Stratasys are being hunted.
First, the goal of research is to create a patch for every virus.
The use of viruses that are either non-viable or dead, for the purpose of a rapid immune response to a new infection with COVID-19.
Second, subtypes are intended to create a pathogen that makes the immune system sensitive to specific parts of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these studies focus on the S-spike protein which helps the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme substrate.
The third strategy is to nucleate nucleotides (DNA or RNA nucleotides, a new form of cutenation).

The Korean government and the Chinese health authorities have recommended the use of chloroquine. Chloroquine is a malaria-causing agent.
However, the Wuhan Institute for Viral Research, while recommending a daily meal of one gram, notes that skipping two meals at a meal is dangerous and fatal.
On May 28, 2020, the FDA announced that the use of hydrochloroquine and chloroquine in the emergency response to people with COVID-19 was authorized in the 7th edition of the Chinese guide to interferon (natural body resistance to the virus), ravavirin or amifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that dietary intake of ribavirin is essential for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been suggested for further in vivo drying following the demonstration of low SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. Studies have shown that the primary spleen protein produced by the muscle protein-transfer enzyme 2 (TMPRSS2) is the basis for entry into SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
