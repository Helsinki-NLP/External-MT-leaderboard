The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: 29% in total
The perceived weakening of both existing parties in the Grand Coalition and the marked strengthening of right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), in which the position of the current President, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously wavering, has suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the deputy prefect of Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to national politics.
According to provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the vote, but it loses 5.5% compared to the last election in 2006.
Even worse for ÖVP, which lost by 25.6% almost 9% of the vote.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in postwar Austrian history and above all the literally catastrophic results of the popular vote, which led to early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the popular preference over SPÖ was a considerable advantage.
But the voters have obviously punished them for bringing down the government.
Already in the early reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party chairman, Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday during the extraordinary party leadership summit.
This development should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely exit from the electoral outcome, namely the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
The strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) gained 18% and the BZÖ 11% of the vote early - but the Social Democrats also revealed the concern of another 1999 when the populists agreed with the people to a collective government (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) that was even the reason for sanctions by the European Union.
This is clearly the case with Mr Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and is assuming a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party also managed to enter Parliament but fell slightly, dropping from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If the problem is not solved with the Czech scientists who have been accused of illegally collecting beetles in India, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there will be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it were not resolved, then yes, there would be a certain cooling", he said after the meeting, which took place on Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that the executive could hardly interfere in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charges and fined, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved", said the Minister.
Mukherjee said Emil Kucera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, would rather appeal to a higher court.
Then you can ask for bail and wait for your release.
Mr Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed the same opinion during the negotiations.
"Request the High Court and then you can get the pardon", said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get involved is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support", the Indian Minister argued.
At the same time, he said that such support was already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have a strong interest in maintaining the best relations we have had for many years with India.
The Indians also admit it", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider the imprisonment and the accusation of these Czech scientists a profound mistake", he said.
The Minister avoided answering the question whether he had obtained the Indian side's promise to deal with the matter.
"I got relatively many promises", he merely noted.
A Czech judge in the Battle of the Seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall that depicts Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
But it's not about the continent, it's about a little lost spot in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and to the sea bottom.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 workers from the OSN Ocean and Maritime Rights Division.
His chief, the Czech lawyer, the head of the division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exposition and adds something every now and then.
It's a great way to get a job and a great feeling.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metallic minerals and other minerals, but also living organisms unknown until now that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest bottom of the mainland
Coastal states have begun to take an interest in the underwater territory.
The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which is the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, is that they take advantage of the laws that they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf which often extends up to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the State concerned.
That one has an exclusive right under the Convention to all the resources of the continental shelf.
'In short, continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often over 200 nautical miles", explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the Scale of the Continental Shelf must be accompanied by a very extensive technical and scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
'One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical professional assistance.
The Committee has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominations were successful", Mikulka adds.
Australia's recent success in substantially expanding its marine holdings has received a worldwide echo.
But New Zealand has also gained us -- the surface of the seabed, which was allocated to it by the commission last week, is about a mile square, so about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits, which they promise will be invaluable from the seabed in the future.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years after the Montego Bay Convention was ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor which the Convention has declared a common heritage of humanity begins.'
No state has an exclusive position here anymore.
The right to extract in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Naval Foundation is not Klondike", says Director Mikulka, exaggerating, "with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regimes established by contract".
The Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed is now also part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, the Convention granted the company, as did investors from a few other countries, the status of a "pioneer investor".
It has the right to mine in the Clarion Clipperton area in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is shattered, it's almost a submarine replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich polymetallic field containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker at the Macedonia division, Rober Sandev, brings a relic to show.
It looks like a little potato or with a little imagination, a legendary pattern, like in the legend of the Golem awakening.
German special forces were present at the hostage release.
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in the release of the hostages.
When the situation became critical, the special forces were ready, but they didn't intervene.
More and more details are coming to us about the circumstances surrounding the release of the 11 European hostages.
The rescue operation, as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, involved German special units.
In addition to the army specialists, GSG9 units, the Federal Aviation Police, the Federal Criminal Bureau and the technical establishment's logistics experts were present on the scene.
As the ministry spokesman said on Monday evening, German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of forced intervention, released the hostages on the run.
The Egyptian government accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
"We didn't get there by chance", says a spokesman for the interior ministry.
On September 19, attackers abducted a group of travelers in southern Egypt: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian woman as well as their eight Egyptian companions.
After the abduction in a deserted area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers was kept secret until the end as were the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the liberated arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages released are under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't elaborate on the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin about when they would return to Germany.
According to Bild, the five vacationers and special units are expected to fly a military air force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The first chamber of the US Congress just failed the $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones is down.
With 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's financial market bailout.
Despite the calls of US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority for the programme, which would have been enough to stem the financial market chaos.
In a dramatic move, supporters have tried desperately to persuade critics with the heavy $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the negotiators, urged the MPs to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
È difficile avere riconoscenza per evitare qualcosa, che non è ancora arrivata..
While the vote was in progress, the Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent, or 600 points.
The investor's reason for concern was that the state bailout could fail.
It resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of the failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect further serious turmoil in international financial markets.
The Commission has already decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the programme is implemented.
Promoters are recording rising bookings
It looks like it 's going to be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to one study, the turnover on travel bookings for the coming months compared to the previous year increased significantly - for the winter season by more than 30%.
Despite the weak views of the situation, the desire to travel in Germany is still strong.
Travel agencies have recorded a 31% increase in their winter bookings compared to the same period last year, the German tourism association DRV said on Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey by the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking quotas for the autumn months.
The surplus of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would therefore amount to around 11%, the DRV reported.
The GfK analyses booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
Travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 would also be included.
The report also highlights the importance of the use of the euro as a means of supporting the development of the euro area.
The increase in reservations here would be about a third.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should adopt a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
In particular, all-inclusive travel is highly rated, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Given the rising costs of energy and food, costs in this case would be 'better calculated for customers than for an individually organised holiday'.
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts on bookings made well in advance or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months would also have been very good for booking, with a surplus in turnover again recorded compared to the previous year - although a further study showed that the number of Germans travelling had fallen compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Oktoberfest
Ballermann hits, a pint of beer and a Vip in dirndln scratched.
A debut at the Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't actually have much in common.
She's blonde, TV host and wears a custom-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing we all have in common: just three minutes at Wiesn, photographers are already throwing themselves at us and taking pictures until they fill the memory of the very flattering cameras, and this is when I first visited Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The two-dollar dirndl seems to be getting its point.
As a tourist in Wiesn and a resident of the White sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress to this day remains limited.
And when you get to Theresienwiese, it's not that bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed  everything perfectly normal.
Only my dirndl's crutch collects strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A nun makes me notice that I would tie the bracelet wrong: "On the left you are free, in the center you are virgins, on the right you are engaged, behind the widow".
I'm just going to fix my nose from behind to the left.
All right", he says, laughing.
Others waste subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, which are labeled "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch their bare back against an uninvited person.
The boy with the exhibitionist leanings is Bob, he's from England and he's also visiting the Oktoberfest for the first time.
She finds it "gorgeous", with a "ooooo" shredded.
This is what he tells me, after he got rid of his beer mug from a liter of beer he drank before.
Right next to one of these watermen, who everyone thinks is a pimp.
Bob is one of those notorious "Wildbiesler" guys.
Others are not fortunate enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about 8 p.m. the paramedics, who have to take care of the poor beon, march in packs on the party square.
The nurses appear in packs every time  always 4 at a time dragging a barrel of tent covered into the tent.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: you go empty, you come back full.
Whoever lies under the curtain in this blood alcohol coffin, you don't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn", shouts one of the paramedics and disappears into the shed.
Victim of an accident identified by police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking to Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died shortly after.
After the accident a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the finest relics of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the tour guides tell you.
The building stands on a horseback at the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking out at the world like some German provincial town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the ceiling to the vault, there is no doubt about the greatness of the enterprise of what was the most westerly passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a backward in the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions of dominating the Middle East by this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond into what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed
British and dominating forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station too.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then it has been slowly decaying, largely outdated by history.
But today, this railway exit to Anatolia and all the points to the east, serve - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever-growing diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, caused by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
Now there's a new commitment policy.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the bed car to Ankara, the Turkish capital, to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a run of skid skates along the tracks that produced the ancient world sequences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in Turkish consensus.
He's suggested some suspicion in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built on purpose - in a developing suburb, surrounded by built-up shopping malls and power bakeries, where business executives - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry too.
"The foreign policy party's goal now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbors.
The Cold War was an anomaly", he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its land.
Today, you must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't either one of them.
It must be both.
"But surely at some point", I ask, "Turkey will be forced to decide?"
"Turkey", he says, "does not want to face that choice".
It also points out a point that almost all of the people I have spoken to have memorized: the links of the Middle East and the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically run those railway lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another night of nothing, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had watched this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that the ambitions of Europe in the Middle East can now be largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I wait at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At least then there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent should make claims on this fascinating country.
Remember the days of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As music director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, September 11) had the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir in charge.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under 21 or under 21, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, many of us were in our 20s - we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-mutant) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face everything that music presented to do, whether madrigals or Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the entire orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and it was all because of that man's inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant through the years.
How often Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique of using the stick was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial or flourishing.
Whatever the musical standard, it was getting higher and higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to be knighted, a conductor would be Vernon Handley.
I got to know him very well during his two decades as the conductor of the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years or so, I've watched more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I've never disagreed with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "ridden around the world on one or two well-known war horses".
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary by William Woodruff (September 25) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... studying for a bachelor's degree in science, a master's degree in letters and a PhD at the same time".
This follows from Woodruff's note in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a university lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the U.S. as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, we don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his black and white photographs, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have caught my attention for the simplicity and strength they convey, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
A show that conveys a lot of emotion.
Resino can capture magical moments".
Second assault for the Honda over-the-counter
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already well-equipped, this new single-seater has an even larger interior space.
To this must be added refined mechanics, which increases driving comfort and saves fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz is aesthetically similar to the previous model, the changes in this single-cylinder are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before we go on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the first generation entered the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has updated this model in shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz model is less well known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan alone, almost one million units of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
So, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which corresponds to 6,7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish branch officials expect to sell about 2,000 Jazz units within a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce sales in Spain to a considerable extent.
In fact, the company's executives expect to reach the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 fewer than in 2007, down 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8%, compared with 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To do that, Honda relies on another new model to arrive.
It is a five-door, compact-shaped Insight hybrid - 4.37 meters long - that the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For the markets and according to the estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned for the first months of the year, immediately after its corporate launch in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and diameter 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the living interior is also enlarged.
This advantage is derived, on the one hand, from the introduction of a new platform, and, on the other hand, from the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the  double-backed trunk - rises to 399 litres, or 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the dimensions of the 1.4 engine version, and that the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 trunk is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear-view-glass or the possibility of mounting panoramic glass - include an improvement in rear seat accessibility.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions open at an 80 degree angle, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also, the engines in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be offered in 1.2 and 1.4 litre petrol engines.
Both mechanisms include i-VTEC technology which allows lower consumption, less carbon dioxide emissions, optimizes mechanics while keeping engine torque high at all stages.
The 1.2 litre model allows for a power output of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion  which in previous Jazz reached 78 horses - uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions equal to about 125 grams.
Compared with the previous generation, which used 83 horses, 100 are now available.
The 1.4 horsepower Jazz achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
The bee car to avoid collisions
In developing accident prevention technologies, Nissan has taken inspiration from nature, and especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, for example, by flying bees, can avoid accidents.
It's the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is an extension of the Nissan four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is designed to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the manufacturer.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the bees' compound eyes, which can see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly uninterrupted in its personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, engineers have developed what they call a localization laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within two metres and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that immediately prevents collision.
"The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels at a right or higher angle to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If it wasn't, the robot wouldn't be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate up or down, nor even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can turn and not by exploiting endless directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid collisions.
"This device just needs to process the information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It doesn't require the storing of information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruptions and with only a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, and we're not talking about mega".
It is the first step towards developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to get the driver to their destination avoiding obstacles along the way.
Shake before you ask for a loan
We must recognize that the US Treasury Department, besides having a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and to prevent Americans from getting involved in junk loans in banks with dubious insolvency, they created a fun and educational game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "bad credit hotel" or the "problem hotel".
The dark aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to make you think not once, but two or even three times before applying for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
The information provided by the game is certainly useful, but it is not very detailed.
It's more of a teenage page than a site for the general public.
What happens if the game is complete?
Well, there's a drinking room inside the hotel.
It's always something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk about...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that it has signed an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, to invest $9 billion in a 21 percent stake in the company, following a sharp decline in its stock market shares.
A week after the provisional agreement was drawn up, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum equal to $3 billion.
The price established is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will also invest $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, providing a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley has stated that the global transaction would be carried out on the basis of an average price of $29 per share, or a percentage below its current price of 28%.
At 5 p.m., however, Morgan Stanley stock was down 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to a bank holding company", explained John Mack, the group's US CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to diversify its stock and yet bring it under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than previously assumed.
The arrangements set out on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained: "We thought our stake would be solely of ordinary shares.
But given the current state of the world economy and market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect ourselves".
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will acquire Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their carrying amount of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the diluted equity".
The agreement provides that MUFG can convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares within one year if, over a given period, the latter are traded more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or at around US$47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG would allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its budget and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to provide details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After the investment by MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier 1 solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said it had "clearly" eased its balance sheet from the end of August.
The last few weeks have been a tough one for the group, which has seen its stock value halved while the cost of risk insurance has skyrocketed.
The cost of the project was high, however, at around 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" among Wall Street's major investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa to Quito, we're going to Monday.
To found the republic on socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuela's Hugo Chávez, Bolivia's Evo Morales and Ecuador's Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, he was the last to give voice to the draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to official results, 64% of voters voted yes to the referendum, on an 80% basis.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, the "no" was 7% and the "white card" was 0.7%.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polling stations and an estimate by a non-governmental organization announced a staggering "yes" victory, placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft Constitution in the night between Sunday and Monday.
"The Constitution triumphed gloriously", he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians in the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was held in a calm manner under the Organization of American States (OAS) election observation mission, was based on a 444-point text to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the President.
This draft Constitution confers on the state power over the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially on the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
The draft, conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, also gives greater power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, and has the possibility of dissolving the assembly.
Correa has already announced his intention to take advantage of this amendment and to re-apply for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also states that health and education are free, which the President has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched an assault on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions who were abducted 10 days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive in the desert for 10 days were returned to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon, safe and sound.
In the morning, they were liberated in Chad by an Egyptian command.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived at the Almaza military base near Cairo International Airport at about 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft.
On board a helicopter, they were immediately transferred, without being able to give any press interviews, to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for analysis.
They are in "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to the hijackers", said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna, on the runway.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been unloaded from hiding place to hiding place by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists  five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian  and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the safari organising agency.
An Egyptian security official said 30 special forces members, aboard two helicopters, launched the assault during the night, just before dawn.
"There were gunshots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled", said the official who requested anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lamp" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed from Belgrade the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We must admit that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our intelligence services, the special forces", he said, without adding any further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle aboard which the kidnappers were on board and to have killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and captured two.
According to the army, the kidnappers were linked to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a claim immediately denied by the latter.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
On the front page is a debate on the financing of culture that the current election campaign is focusing on.
That's all right.
But a part of our cultural life is always in the shadows.
Who will speak out against the poor amounts allocated to small museums, archives, archaeological digs or starving national historic sites?
What politician will dare remind the federal government that it is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is paying three and a half million euros for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley alone?
To our American neighbors, it is the Constitution that states that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all this by common accord.
In Quebec, at least 40 000 volunteers are employed by the Federation des sociétés historiques du Québec, which, grouped into 211 societies for the safeguarding of historical, genealogical, archival and heritage assets, preserve, with four coins, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate agents and decision-makers use their bulldozers to attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize a part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries are helping through partial nationalization the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which has been in trouble for the first time in Europe due to the American credit market crisis: the three nations will provide EUR 11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level over the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
The first major crisis in the euro area in the context of the difficulties facing the international financial market for more than a year is that of Fortis Bank, and in some respects the decisions taken in this regard can set a precedent.
Under the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank's share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch company ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week Fortis' stock had started collapsing vertically, and serious signs of the institute's crisis were showing up later in the second half of the week.
Analysts agree, however, that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too big to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank's shares fell nearly 12 percent on Friday, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
The total capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the bank's management this is not real.
The company's top blames the collapse of Fortis shares on uncertainties in the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US$700 billion plan.
The headline picked up again on Monday.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank's new CEO.
The financial institution has also sought out private buyers but so far no one has come forward with a worthy offer.
The Belgian government had already assured investors that they should not fear losing money.
The bank's customers were not panicked, the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary Fortis owns independent subsidiaries and has also acquired leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurers, based on people's medical billing data, often refuse to take out an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
'There is a privacy programme whereby the use of prescription data depends on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it's like entrusting the chicken to the fox", writes the Washington Post, citing Richard Dick, author of the program to follow prescriptions for medicines.
Insurance companies shall subordinate the insurance rate and the surcharge in case of accidents to the health status of the potential customer and if they consider the risk too high they shall not provide insurance.
A long time ago the client had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was only concluded after the examination.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure 10 years ago: the customer's identification code can easily give you information from pharmacies about which medicines he has bought in the last year and a half and from that the program shows which diseases he suffers from and what health conditions he is in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, that means that your blood fat level is virtually undeniably high and you're classified as the highest risk category.
There are several versions of the programme on the market, some of which also determine the risk multiplier, the insurer, so apart from paperwork, there is not much left, even if there are minor difficulties.
Some medicines are used for multiple purposes, such as some compounds are used against migraines or heat stroke, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is a risk-increasing factor from an insurance-commercial point of view, while the first two are not.
Separate companies have been formed to request and process data and before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies they ask for the patient's approval.
Now the authorities are forcing you to do so even though they have not imposed fines for negligence so far.
Some companies have also recently processed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to data on drug use to provide a more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data and at the same time, controlling usage will become increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law but it only applies to health services and insurance.
There is a bill before Congress that gives authorities control over data services firms.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough: he has therefore developed a programme that links the data forwarding with the express approval of the person concerned.
The other issue is that the person concerned cannot so much as deny approval because otherwise the insurers do not stipulate the contract.
So then the chickens are finally entrusted to the fox's mercy.
The overall menu of Marseilles
EU and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are mainly trading partners, this theme was also the agenda of the ninth summit, as well as all other global issues.
Today there will be a French-Indian summit, which will focus primarily on cooperation on nuclear energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is becoming a major democratic power and should be given more voice in international affairs, but member countries have yet to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So this was not the issue that was raised at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, acting President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double trade in five years, i.e. increase it to EUR 100 billion.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods increased from 25 to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious target.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements, so air traffic can also start in the future.
India would like to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The aim is to balance because while the EU is India's top trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth among the EU partners.
The summit focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism have been condemned in all its forms by both sides and have called for a UN conference to be convened.
They called for the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both sides played a role in its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will continue to be part of the energy and climate programme, meaning that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as that a global agreement should be signed at the next year's climate conference and that greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will travel to the French capital today to prepare for a bilateral meeting to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, French companies are expected to receive a contract worth 20 billion euros to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to our press agency, the deal would last 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expected to attract more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, who will occupy the 171,790 square metres of the fair with over 403,000 titles on display and Turkey as the guest of honour.
The Italian Government will be represented by the Undersecretary at the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Heritage Francesco Maria Giro at the Italian Pavilion opening ceremony.
The meeting with the press will follow at the Structural Room in Bucharest's hall 5.0 to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors on the total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and children, is gradually decreasing.
The plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago, was found.
The wreckage of Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-meter-high plateau in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, there were no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson avoided the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it's exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared", he said at a news conference.
The sheriff then said no human remains were found in the plane or the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was presumed dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (Ntsb) said that a team of investigators was dispatched hours after the wreckage was spotted, and identified the apparatus as the Bellanca 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, again in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal effects were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents in Fossett's name, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a vest.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire had earned his place in history through a long series of primates.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a round the world flight on a balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had flown around the world without a stopover.
Among his many records, he also flew at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you're not expecting
An out-of-the-box SUV with an original design and well defined lines, wide surfaces and sharp corners.
This is, in short, the latest generation of the "compact" offroad of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a new lease on the industry.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a directive on the marketing of the Suv Glk.
The advertising campaign that will accompany the debut of the new car will also trigger an unprecedented mode of communication through a futuristic 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi-affirmations, divided into three different phases, which will dominate the central shopping street of Milan, the Como Corso, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the picture will give the impression that the car is leaving the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then reassembled into a single image.
No doubt Mercedes is trying to introduce something new with this advertisement into the stereotyped field of automotive communication.
Will this formula be able to spark interest from prospective buyers?
That's who the Italian hooligans are.
Del Triveneto, they're risking the DASPO.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the Ultra Italia group that has been following the Blue National for years and that has never, in fact, created too many problems.
He never had a run-in with the opposing fans.
The group extraction is on the right.
The prosecutors are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
These were joined in Sofia by small groups (a few units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-color flags where the militants' hometowns appear: they were removed on Saturday night to avoid identification.
They're inspired by the English typhus.
They found a typhoid of real Nazis in Bulgaria, the Levski.
Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all nominative, so easily controllable.
And Viminale had controlled them all: among those who went to Sofia there was no one with a Daspo going on, no one who had been prevented from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had previously committed stadium crimes, had been denied a ticket and prevented from transferring.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the documents that will come from the Bulgarian police and then take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the riots.
An international stage that prevents you from going to Italian stadiums and all of Europe.
Our hooligans, I mean, they're not gonna set foot in a stadium again.
I'm glad you did.
But now there is the fear-emulation: that to those little more than a hundred and fifty, they add others.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave this way", the Viminale argues.
So, "keep your eyes open especially for Wednesday's national match in Lecce".
In fact, there is a small core of supporters of Ultras Italia in Puglia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can count on a section of the Aise, that is, the secret services, which deals precisely with stadium problems.
"The Duke-Duke choirs and the arm stretched out during the hymn of Mameli?
This is the thought (expressed in a really unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks director of the Viminale Observatory (he took the place that was first Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been mayor of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to play the Duce but certainly the behaviour of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist", adds the Observatoire's No. 1, "the crimes must be attributed to the country where the crime is committed.
So far this group has been in line, so now we will see what happened and we will assess for the future.
But let's also talk about whistles in the hymn of Mameli: those too are not a crime, but if you will excuse me, they are not education... "
