Gutach: more safety for pedestrians
They are less than 100 metres apart: on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian crossing at the village car park in Gutach was put into operation - within sight of the older town hall crossing.
Two plants so close together, was it intentional or a prank?
The mayor of Gutach gave a clear answer to this question yesterday.
"The town hall lamp was installed because it protects the school road", explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser-Ampel are safe for cyclists, bus passengers and residents of the Bergle.
The plant, which was officially put into operation yesterday, was important for the intersection of Sulzbachweg/Kirchstra√üe.
We have the museum, two churches, the health resort, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank, and the traffic flow from the Grub residential area.
"With the high volume of traffic and pedestrians, a new traffic light was needed to ensure their safety", Eckert said.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landrat Office Offenburg.
"According to current measurements, about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B33 daily, of which about 10% are heavy goods vehicles", Arnold emphasises.
The construction of another traffic light is therefore more than necessary: "Safety is simply here", says Arnold.
In total, four traffic shows were carried out, and a roundabout was also envisaged, but was rejected again because of the narrow junction between Sulzbachweg and Kirchstrasse.
Arnold says that the location of the traffic lights was tested beforehand: "We used a special transporter for us, loaded with particularly long logs, to test whether these vehicles could leave Sulzbachweg and go to B 33 without breaking the traffic lights".
The lamp system itself, which costs around EUR 15 000, is "the most modern on the market", Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that shine so brightly that the lights can be easily seen by motorists even in the deepest sunlight.
And it's also economical: The older lights use about 100 watts, the newer ones just eight watts.
There are three lights per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian presses the traffic light, the radar sensor on the top tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, it's green for the pedestrian immediately, if it's not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be terminated for the pedestrian.
"If a group of people or disabled people cross the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone can cross the road safely", explained Arnold.
Of course, the driver would have to think alongside the driver and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: the pedestrian traffic light barely showed green, a luxury vehicle was rushing through - with a bright red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has written about the hardships of his childhood and youth.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the lack of language, the penchant for crude violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - have been described by the Carinthian poet many times.
The Booker Prize winner is known primarily as a prose writer, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage of prose texts Gerhard Fresacher is therefore putting together a collage of prose texts for his performance "Wetterleuchten auf der Zungenspitze", which can now be seen in the Garage X on Petersplatz.
The theatre-maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminations from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003), for example.
On the largely empty stage - an important prop: a crumpled sofa, on which, by allusion, copulation and masturbation are carried out - the eight-member ensemble is hanging on to the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text.
The 70-minute performance overshadows the template with a wealth of director's influences, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic play forms.
The actresses in particular are affected by the sometimes questionable scenic transitions.
They are touched hard, their heads are submerged under water, their evening gowns are tacked to the wall.
Trapped in cellophane or tights, they strike dangerously high stakes through the staging, either monologuing loudly or lying completely silent on the stage floor.
But the text is hardly transmitted in this restricted way.
The best moments are the evening when the band is singing - from Deep Purple to folk music.
It is only towards the end that the exaggerated performance comes to a halt, and Winkler's absurd humour is revealed.
A black box in the car?
American road planners are looking for a source of funding to fix the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a little black box that fits in the dashboard of every car.
The devices, which record every dangerous mile and report the information to authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding U.S. roads.
The normally rather boring field of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined with environmental groups to advocate that the government use the little boxes to record the miles driven  and possibly where they were driven  and then use the information to calculate tax returns.
The Tea Party is terrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and has raised a number of privacy concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states are not waiting any longer.
They are looking at how they can move over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is a must for our country.
"It's not something we're just going to use", said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which plans to record the miles driven by all California motorists in the state by 2025.
The way we pay these taxes is going to change.
The technology is there for that.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by the taxes Americans pay to the column, is bankrupt.
But America doesn't fill up as much as it used to.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not been raised for 20 years.
The Commission has already taken steps to ensure that the Community's energy policy is not undermined by the failure to implement the directive.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable", says Lee Munnich, a traffic law expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mileage-based pay system.
'This is the most sensible alternative in the long term,' he said.
Bureaucrats call it an email-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is popular with urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way that traffic jams and greenhouse gases are reduced.
California planners are relying on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state's ambitious, legally mandated climate change goals.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees this as the most viable long-term alternative.
The Reason Foundation's free marketers are also intrigued by the idea of paying drivers by the mile.
"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole", explains Adrian Moore, Reason's Vice President for Policy.
People pay for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transportation secretaries who, in a 2011 report, called on Congress to move toward mail-based billing.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives blocked the move, responding to the concerns of rural MPs who represent people who often have to travel many miles to get to work or to the city in their daily lives.
Nevertheless, several states and large cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon be paying the mileage instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering one.
Illinois is testing it on a limited basis with trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes the transportation departments of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently studying how to implement the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently fitted with the devices, motorists were skeptical that the government could be tracking their every move.
"It was a big problem to have concerns about Big Brother and things like that", explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test was underway, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into full-fledged surveillance devices".
There is no need to build up a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking at affordable technology that allows the state to track the miles driven, but not exactly when and where.
Khan said that would also help the public.
The pursuit of this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not enter the business to help states tax motorists.
Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are expected to pay based on miles driven.
But the devices she tested are also of interest to road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which is regularly uploaded by modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and location are not recorded", said Ryan Morrison, managing director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot schemes have been seriously flawed.
There are far cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose not to use any equipment at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all residents of the state.
Other agencies hope to sell the concept to a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more features rather than fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials are planning to develop a taxing device that would also pay parking fees, require insurance to be paid only for miles driven, and collect real-time speed data from other vehicles to help motorists avoid traffic jams.
'Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits the system offers', says a city planning document.
Some traffic planners, however, wonder if all the talk about paying per mile is just a giant distraction.
Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay Area said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other low-fuel vehicles so that they too pay a fair share.
"There is no need for surgery if an aspirin is enough", explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's Head of Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
K√∂nigsfeld: Small team beats themselves
The volunteer fire department handled their autumn recruitment challenge with bravado despite staff shortages.
Only 11 men took part in the exercise.
In his training, the division commander, Hans Kammerer, had chosen the property in the Burgberger Stra√üe.
There's a short circuit that's been created by the sawing.
The resulting fire and smoke caused two injuries, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
Two Wehr's respirator bearers, after the first check of the situation by Hans Kammerer, prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, the first person was found and led out into the open.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not easy, since there was a narrow stairway to be climbed.
The building, a workshop with a two-horse stable, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw in it.
Then there were electric machines for working wood.
The first fire was from the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was run through a flood hydrant about 100 metres away.
Now three erasure attacks could be designed.
A hollow-beam tube was also used in the building.
The exercise also aimed to show what could be done with the limited staff available.
In an emergency, support is provided by the K√∂nigsfeld day-time task force.
The commander was satisfied with the way the exercise went.
Networking between universities and firms is important
The Commission has also been asked to present a report on the implementation of the directive on the protection of workers from harmful exposure to asbestos.
At the Hochschwarzwald Support Centre, he studied this important question together with the managing directors of the vocational schools and the district school and the chairman of the parents' council.
"Education is an important location factor", underlined Claudia Stehle, Head of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the F√∂rderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and Vocational School Center in the city of W√§lder.
He also praised the family-friendliness of the district.
"It is important to look at not only the family phase, but also the care phase of caring for relatives because of demographic change", Wolf explained.
He also noted that more and more workers were taking care of their loved ones.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting strain on employees can lead to termination of employment", said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose a skilled workforce, he said.
Another factor, particularly important, was the networking of universities and companies.
"Those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies often retain the knowledge and skills acquired in the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region", the President of the Landtag was convinced.
The Commission has also proposed that the new system of vocational training should be introduced in the Member States.
In his opinion, the district's location advantage is its advantageous location in southwestern Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport in the area on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg.
"Keep on being persistent and make sure that public transportation is better", he told the assembled local politicians.
Enjoy an Afternoon of Music
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has invited the elderly of Dietingen for coffee, cake and afterwards a vespers.
In the past, the elderly were accommodated in the rest home.
Meanwhile, this afternoon, we're at the St. Joseph's Home for the Aged.
The locals were delighted with the delicious cakes and pies.
Later, they had sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with common melodies.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall, which was the front partition between the old schoolyard and the Kirchstra√üe, which is to be renovated, is to be included again in the cost plan for the city of Br√§unlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, during the first work of the renovation of the front schoolyard, a small angled wall was built to stabilize and relieve the static load of the over one hundred year old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The next step, according to Alexander Misok of the Br√§unlinger city planning office, is to involve the Landesdenkmalamt in the planning and to draw up a concept for the rehabilitation of the old wall.
The cost calculation is then to be carried out by experts and submitted to the council for decision and determination of the next course of action.
A decision on this is expected to be taken as early as next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old schoolyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the boundary walls in need of renovation must be renovated from the ground up and placed on new substructure in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure.
The historic, one hundred year old separation wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstra√üe, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, in need of rehabilitation and has an arched slope forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones indicate weather damage, but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse.
A solid wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by pupils, which has been done through the current fortification works.
The renovation of the school yard was originally planned for 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure caused a delay.
An important word in the historical school renovation, which has even been used for filming, will be spoken by the National Monument Office.
If the site is subject to any regulations, the town of Br√§unlingen is hoping for grants from the monument protection authorities.
The pupils of the Br√§unlinger Grundschule, who are now taught in a well-restored old school building with a new classroom, will soon be able to use the old school yard.
√ñzdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem √ñzdemir, the leader of the Greens, has now joined the ongoing discussions on the future of music colleges in Baden-W√ºrttemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic training at the Stuttgart University of Music", √ñzdemir told the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music are now coming together in the jazz city of Stuttgart.
The Green-Red government is thus in opposition to √ñzdemir, who is considered to be the favorite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the September 22 Bundestag elections.
The Commission is forcing a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden-W√ºrttemberg on the basis of an expert study.
The programme of studies Jazz and Pop is to be transferred from the Stuttgart University of Music to the Mannheim University of Music.
US border: 'Super Tunnel' for drug smuggling discovered
On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super-tunnel" for drug smuggling.
The U.S. Customs Service said the 500-foot-long pipe between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail, and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested and eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
The tunnel was reportedly not yet in use.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can get under the radar", said Laura Duffy, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California, at a news conference outside a warehouse in San Diego where one end of the tunnel was discovered.
"If you continue to build and use tunnels like this, "we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money".
Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a constant battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in drug-related crimes.
Designed by experts
Because of the elaborate design of the tunnel, investigators believe that it was designed by architects and engineers and that construction took about a year.
The railway was equipped to allow the use of electrically powered cars.
On the Mexican side, the entrance is in a building that's 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads to the actual tunnel entrance, 20 meters down.
The tunnel is 4 feet (1.2 m) high and 3 feet (90 cm) wide.
He would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for possession of marijuana.
All three face the maximum sentence of life imprisonment, officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, the press conference in San Diego said.
But it was the first time cocaine had been found in such a tunnel.
Usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "despair" of drug gangs whose traditional routes have been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the San Diego DEA.
They'd do anything to get into the U.S.
No details were released about the detainees, but at least one was said to be Mexican.
You're looking at up to ten years in prison.
2014 is the year of Geisinger
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer.
When the year ends in about eight weeks, the Jubilee year will be here.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were mentioned together for the first time in 794.
A charter was drawn up in Kirchen, mentioning both places.
On March 15th there will be an official opening ceremony for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening ceremony will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
The anniversary is being celebrated with a number of events in Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen.
Kirchen-Hausen will celebrate its 125th anniversary in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate your return.
On Friday with a festival, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
This weekend is also the Kirchenhausen Kirchenfest.
The city's music director, Rudolf Barth, has written a commissioned composition for the city to mark the anniversary, which will be performed at three dates.
On June 21st, together with the Black Forest Club's solstice celebration, on July 12th in the arena with fireworks and on December 13th as the first concert of the city's music in the new ballroom.
The new building will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, with the official date being the last weekend of September, 27 and 28.
On the occasion of Geisinger's city anniversary, a new chronicle is also being published.
"It is not intended to be a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but a printed work on Geisingen today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen", says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also the Geisingen of today celebrates 2014 birthday, in 1974 the present-day space was completed with the enthusiasts.
The new chronicle is to be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year of many anniversaries.
The Strohglonki madhouse begins on February 8 with a ceremony to mark its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen turns 90 and has the festival banquet on March 29 and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger school has been 50 years old at its new location and celebrates this on May 10, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Fountain Festival from July 4 to 7.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a donation certificate in the possession of the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The deed was made in Kirchen (Hausen), which was then the courthouse.
Both communes are therefore mentioned in the same document.
In addition to the celebration of the 1250th anniversary in 2014, the municipal reform is 40 years behind.
Council takes aim at railway installations
Should the Am Hirschen railway crossing be extensively rebuilt to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the town council has decided.
Schiltach has to take 220,000 euros in his hand.
Deutsche Bahn is going to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
The aim is to improve safety at railway crossings - collisions between trains and other vehicles are a regular occurrence across Germany.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must contribute one third of the costs, the remainder being shared between the railways and the federal government.
Schiltach's town planner Roland Grie√ühaber explained to the local council the special features of the railway crossing "Am Hirschen".
The city plans to build an extension on the west side of the railway tracks at the level of the tunnel mouth.
Larger vehicles, such as those carrying longwood, could also be stationed there in the event of oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grie√ühaber therefore proposed that a necessary retaining wall be constructed so that the city could widen the road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed controversially in the town council, as some councillors questioned the need for road widening: Thomas Kipp's statement brought the mood of the critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money for so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for longwood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the section at the Hiberlesbr√ºcke because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a bypass for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, argued Haas.
It was foreseeable that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and rehabilitated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, and that the railway crossing 'Am "Hirschen" could also have an important transport significance for a longer period.
The councils agreed to have an examination of the costs of the proposed widening of the road.
Nevertheless, the majority of votes were cast in favour of the conversion of the railway crossing, on the condition that the required retaining wall would be built in such a way that the city could extend the adjacent road towards the "Bahnhofstrasse" to around 5,5 metres, if necessary, for interchange traffic.
The conversion of the railway crossing at Gerberei Trautwein could, however, create a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the rapidly rising "Geroltzh√§user Weg".
The administration had the plans for the conversion of the track examined by the engineering office Breinlinger, as it had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzh√§user way was then still possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it could not be excluded that the road gradient could cause longer vehicles to be stuck.
The responsibility for this was again borne by the city as the road-building burden-bearer.
The conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the timber supply and the bending were working in the current state of development, Haas argued that the conversion of the railway crossing should not be approved.
The risk of a collision with a vehicle on the crossing is also much lower than at the other crossings because the central stop is located directly next to it and there is good visibility.
Even trains from the central station would have to stop at this point to avoid a collision.
The majority of the councillors rejected the proposal to rebuild the railway crossing, saying that the city of Schiltach would have to "solve" the problem of standing cars, as the railway could withdraw its responsibility after the construction work was completed.
The committee considers that the conversion of the "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" railway junctions, for which cross-connection agreements with the railway have already been concluded, is not problematic.
ESA decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Far away planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects they want to launch in the next few years.
Thirty proposals were available for selection, five are still in the race.
Far away worlds.
More than 1,000 planets have been found by astronomers around other stars.
Whether there is life on at least some of them, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: Should we look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origins of the cosmos?
Or search for Earth-like planets and perhaps discover alien life?
These are the questions that the heads of the European Space Agency, ESA, are asking themselves.
For their programme Cosmic Vision, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make a decisive contribution to research.
The budget for such 'L-missions' is about one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were up for debate, five of which have now been narrowed down.
Numerous bodies reviewed the proposals, checked with the researchers.
A final decision is expected to be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee in the next few days.
In total, ESA has selected four major questions for the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme, which was launched in 2007.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes that lead to the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus to the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, what are the conditions under which life can arise?
To address this question, the Cheops space telescope is to be launched in 2017, to study in more detail the 500 known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could image Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, searching for "biomarkers", gases that are considered indicators of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is ultimately intended to reveal the conditions for the origin of life.
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation it emits with the planetary system play an important role.
In our solar system, these processes can be studied by example.
The European Space Agency has already approved an M-class mission (with a budget of about half a billion euros) for this purpose, the Solar Orbiter.
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and will closely monitor the Sun's surface and activity.
Of great interest to researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.
They want to know what role this giant planet played in the evolution of the solar system.
The ESA is planning the first of three L-mission missions under the Cosmic Vision programme.
The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is to study the planet's atmosphere and the icy moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter in extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws of nature we know still apply there.
Perhaps there are deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory that would unite all known laws of nature.
How did the universe come into existence and what is it made of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was born from the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter we see, which is made up of stars, planets and living beings like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters together, and dark energy, which speeds up the expansion of the universe.
Scientists still do not know what the laws of physics were during the first few seconds of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy are.
With Euclid, ESA has already approved an M mission here, scheduled for launch in 2020.
Using a special telescope, the probe will study the distribution of matter in the universe across the entire sky for the first time, allowing conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chance of being approved as an L-mission is, according to many experts, "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
Physicists understand this as changes in the structure of space-time, predicted by Albert Einstein nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to date.
Elisa could do it, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission will include a two- or three-probe detector to be stationed in space.
Unlike facilities on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that were created in the Big Bang, providing new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called Athena, which will explore black holes, among other things; Icy Planets, another mission to the outer planets of the solar system; Prism, a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation; and Exoplanet Finder, which will track down and study Earth-like planets.
Proposals already outlined include the return of samples from Mars, the exploration of the Moon, Venus and asteroids, and solar physics.
Snowden willing to "cooperate" with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower for the US intelligence services, has declared that he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Str√∂bele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin by Str√∂bele on Friday, he writes: Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a breach of faith and tries to criminalize political expression with criminal sanctions, in which no defence is possible.
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden says he is confident that the support of the international community can convince the U.S. government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make that possible".
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained by allegations that the NSA has tapped the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who chairs the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said that the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness should be taken if possible, "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US".
Str√∂bele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.
Str√∂bele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee, Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
The EU's new Commissioner for Justice, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, has said that the EU should be more involved in the fight against corruption.
Snowden's letter explains that he has been subjected to a "serious and ongoing" campaign of persecution that has forced him to leave his home country.
He was, however, concerned by the worldwide reaction to 'my act of political expression'.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior politicians in the United States, have called the revelations of an uncontrolled system of widespread surveillance a public service.
In his letter, Snowden offers cooperation to the German authorities 'when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved'.
Frontier Airlines is charging for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday said passengers would be allowed to keep the entire can.
The new charge applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat remain free of charge.
Frontier explained that the fee is $25 for those who pay in advance, and $100 for those who pay at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is aimed at persuading travelers to pay up front.
'We do not want to calculate this amount,' she said.
In 2008, airlines began to charge for the first and second checked bags.
Passengers who tried to avoid these have therefore stuffed as much as possible into hand luggage, with the result that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way of encouraging passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
The most loyal customers of Frontier, who have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on the Frontier gate may be able to take one piece of luggage free of charge, but the next person on the gate will have to pay $100 for a similar piece of luggage.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures were being changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they arrived at the gate.
Frontier's new hand baggage fee doesn't take effect until the summer, but there's no exact date yet.
Passengers often complain about baggage allowances and other fees, but airlines are happy to use them.
They argue that transporting the baggage costs money and that passengers should pay for this service if they want it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage fees as a sign that airlines are taking in enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them, however, have so far been spared the fingers of hand baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, followed by Allegiant Air, another low-cost carrier.
The only other airline with such a fee is Wizz Air of Hungary, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely following the surcharges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's hand luggage fee generates $50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former executive at Midwest Airlines, recently flew Spirit and was curious about what would await him on the tarmac when passengers were confronted with the airline's unusual hand baggage fee.
'The boarding process was one of the most smoothest I have experienced in my career in aviation,' he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and hand grabbing discussions on the flight deck.
The plane was full, he explained, and the boarding was smooth.
Frontier is also following Spirit's lead in the $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought soda or juice would be allowed to keep the whole can and be refilled with free coffee.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried charging for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed this seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontiers' move to charge for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to its website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz between $10 and $25 for every ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to encourage passengers to buy directly from them rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company started to offer only half as many frequent flyer miles when booked through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced again to 25 percent of the flight distance.
A flight booked with a third-party provider with a border of more than 1,000 miles therefore brings customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively by purchasing directly on Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue declined 9 percent and airline capacity shrank by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has been trying to get a handle on Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs From the Bible
More than 40 women attended the last women's breakfast this year in the Evangelical church in Bisingen.
The theme of the day at the parish hall was "Propositions From the Bible" and "Discourses From the Middle Ages".
Zita K√∂hler, the chairwoman of the church council, discussed the biblical proverbs in a lecture after breakfast.
"Ethics contains life's wisdom, precepts or warnings", she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible verses and explained their meaning.
She used proverbs like: "Let the woodpecker be alert, let the scales fall from the eyes, cast an eye on someone, the Lord gives it to his in sleep, wash his hands in innocence".
Several times the speaker also let her listeners guess which proverb was being used.
The Church's minority, Christel Dehner, adopted the proverb from the Middle Ages: "All good things are three: make blue, cut something".
She explained the meaning and origin of the sayings she called "bridges to the past".
Finally, a raffle was drawn.
The prizes were laid out on a table and described in humorous terms before they were handed to the winners.
Among the women who attended the breakfast, was Mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of being unemployed: pilot project for unskilled tourists
A pilot project for the tourism industry is being launched today on the Mecklenburgseep.
Under the guidance of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who are already working in the sector as unemployed will be trained over three winters to become skilled workers for hotels and restaurants.
"The new thing is that the six-month courses end with degrees", said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg employment agency.
The benefits are manifold: participants would not be unemployed, firms would have access to skilled workers, which were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA says an 'internal error' and not hackers was to blame for the website crash
The shady National Security Agency said late Friday that a bug had brought down its public website for a few hours, not hackers, as claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error during a scheduled update", the spy agency explained in an e-mailed message.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack was not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website had been inaccessible for at least six hours and this is still not the case for some users.
Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not compromised in any way".
The spokesman said that no classified information was in danger.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have crippled the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website crashes.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the target system's internal network.
The once-super-secret NSA, whose nickname was No Such Agency, has now come into the public eye, facing increasing criticism after revelations in recent months about its extensive domestic and foreign surveillance program - a result of secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the intelligence agency has fueled initial speculation that today's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate was 3.1% better than last year and also better than in September, "we had hoped for more", says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the employment agency in Sonthofen.
The reason for this is that many companies have been slow to recruit.
One reason, according to Felder-Bauer, is that "we have a shortage of skilled workers in the craft sector, in health care and in elderly care".
Since September, the number of vacancies in the hotel and catering industry has been increasing again.
The winter season begins there in mid-December.
The full background report can be found in the Allg√§uer Anzeigeblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Bombardier's loss of profit after falling deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc. reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, after being weighed down by declining orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in its railway division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and provided no new information on whether the aircraft could enter commercial service next September according to the ambitious schedule.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago has been followed by only three other launches so far, which makes it doubtful whether the test phase is proceeding as planned.
The results were below expectations and led to a fall of over eight per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
National Bank Financial analyst Cameron Doerksen on Thursday lowered his rating from "outperform" to "sector perform" in light of the limited potential for the stock to sell in the next one to two quarters.
'While weaker delivery figures were widely expected for aircraft, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector,' said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test programme for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to be more sceptical of the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft line will catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
However, so far, firm orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, as potential buyers want to wait for the flight test results to see if the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet transport aircraft are true.
At present, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
The Chairman of the Board, Pierre Beaudoin, is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the jet is put into commercial use.
The company's management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the programme was on schedule.
'The test aircraft did not stay on the ground for longer than expected', Beaudoin said on a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates had been scheduled during the aircraft's service life.
Every manufacturer has a different design.
We decided to make a first flight and then to take a review period, which we did.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to be launched in the next few weeks, with the rest shortly after, the company said.
However, analysts remain sceptical about whether the first customer will be able to operate a CSeries aircraft 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier stated that it was reviewing the EIS and would update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of flight testing, even though it is apparently in line with Bombardier's internal planning, reinforces our view that the start-up will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015", said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ending September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share is unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents a share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 planes this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The order book in the aerospace division stood at $32.9 billion on 30 September, unchanged from 31 December.
'In the aerospace sector, the results were within our target, but the low level of orders and the overall market situation were disappointing,' said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace division fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest manufacturer of railroad trains, announced that its railroad revenue increased by just under 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order book on the transport side was USD 32.6 billion on 30 September, slightly up on 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by the problems of processing some large contracts.
According to the company management, there will be new specifications for the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's stock was down 8.5 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday, to 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that Google's chief financial officer, Patrick Pichette, would be moving to the board.
The Brazilian firm Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
USA: Shots fired at Los Angeles airport
An unknown gunman opened fire at LAX on Friday morning.
While the airport authorities tweeted that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
Media reports also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama is being kept informed of the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident took place in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses claimed to have seen a gunman with a rifle in one of the departure lounges, as reported by several media outlets.
A traveler told CNN that many people were panicking and seeking shelter.
Travelers would have cried and children would have wept.
The police said that the crowd had panicked and that many had hidden behind chairs.
He heard two shots, a traveler told the Los Angeles Times.
A TSA employee suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was "like a movie".
After that, he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots were reported to have been fired near a security checkpoint.
Airport building evacuated
Television footage showed numerous ambulances and police cars driving past a terminal.
Hundreds of people were evacuated from the building.
Users posted photos on Twitter of a special operations team and a rifle lying on the ground.
The airport tweeted that the incident began at 9:30 a.m. local time.
Access roads were closed, which according to CNN, led to long delays.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment in the event of a fire.
However, CNN also showed several of the planes taking off.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles International Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine lawyer who warned drug lord of police investigation sent to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed information to the underworld's most powerful man, Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come out.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court .
A prominent criminal defense attorney who warned a drug lord against a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug habit might be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld big man Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" by criminologists, was arrested in his home in 2011 after police raided Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug case.
Officials observed Scarborough, 32, delivering three bags of cocaine to the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he and colleagues were having a dinner at the bar.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a regular user of Class A drugs, after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They were later arrested along with 32 others after police seized ¬£1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and ¬£200,000 in cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed information to criminals because he was afraid his drug addiction would be made public.
Today Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice.
He admitted to cocaine possession in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was arrested after police investigating Scarborough discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta since February 2011.
Two officers followed the suspect to Ditta's house, where he placed the drugs, 60 percent pure, in a black golf glove, under the lawyer's trash can.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough made regular phone calls to Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer went back home, got the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two of them.
It was revealed in court that Ditta was a 'regular user' of cocaine after tests detected class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine and said he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming their discussion was subject to "attorney-client privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During police questioning, he stated that he had an office both at his home and at his workplace and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it was revealed that he had called key players in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests, and informed investigators what he knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don't break the law".
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney by becoming too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but that of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer for these individuals.
But this was way beyond the bounds of a normal attorney-client relationship.
He interfered with the police investigation as much as possible, so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta has brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately".
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: 'Mr Ditta took the step from criminal defence to criminal the moment he started to acquire drugs from organised crime.'
His cocaine addiction led to hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime who hired him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and instill confidence and trust in the public.
Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Ditta, which also resulted in convictions in three cases for cocaine possession and obstruction of justice, underscoring our resolve to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to traffic heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other drug traffickers were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offenses.
On his website, Ditta posted a Q&A about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, that his ultimate dinner guest was Muhammad Ali, and that inequality was the motivation for his work.
A revolutionary work of church music
The celebrations for its 160th anniversary will conclude with the Dunningen Liederkranz, which will be accompanied by two services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which enthused the audience in the spring of this year, the Liederkranz will enrich two services with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert to conclude the anniversary year.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be heard from 19 during the evening mass in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 a.m. at the service in St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass, with the original title "Songs for the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a sacred musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost considered revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass will be performed as part of the services, as the commissioner Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass band of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism is giving way to confidence
The parish council elections in 2015 will bring fundamental changes to the pastoral care unit in Haslach (SE), for example.
There is then only one joint parish council for all six parishes.
The committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, M√ºhlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes at a joint meeting on Saturday.
The basic decisions of the diocese are not to be changed and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
The day was marked by a shift from scepticism to optimism.
From the ideas and expectations for the 2015 changes to the concrete proposals for the future composition and size of the parish council, the six committees held highly constructive discussions with the main staff members of the pastoral care team.
The regional dean Georg Schmitt gave a presentation on the new guidelines for pastoral care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
The Commission has decided to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the Treaty in respect of the application of the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to the activities of the SE Haslach.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the parish priest of Kraft Amtes will be represented.
The parishes are to be represented by at least two elected members from each parish, and so-called community teams are to be formed in the six parishes.
Their task will be to promote the church life in the village.
The question of the finances of the individual parishes then became a matter for discussion.
The new regulations provide that accumulated funds in the parishes are to be kept for their intended purpose.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the community as a whole.
There were great reservations, particularly with regard to the large investments planned, which would then be undertaken by all the parishes.
"In the past, too, only projects that could be handled by the individual parishes were invested in", said Bruno Prinzbach, chairman of the parish council in Haslach.
The practical experience of a joint committee for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the committee in the pastoral care unit in Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had made it their mission in 2006 to become one, stay five, and they had to realize that it's not that simple.
The committees of the Haslach pastoral unit then set about answering questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the parish teams.
The work will be further developed at further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six committees next spring.
At the end, the new logo of the pastoral unit was presented by the parish priest Michael Sch√∂ner from Steinach, and it was approved by a clear majority.
Electricity is getting more expensive in Pfullendorf
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the public utility, J√∂rg-Arne Bias, confirmed to S√úDKURIER, an additional cost of EUR 70 to 90 per year for a Pfullendorf family of four is expected.
The main reason for the price increase is the increase in the EEG surcharge from 5,277 to 6,3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This rate is re-established each October by the four operators of the major electricity lines.
These companies calculate the additional costs they incur as a result of the energy transition, which they can collect by charging a premium on the electricity price.
The Pfullendorf municipal utility is the last link in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company had even assumed a higher rate in its forecasts, as J√∂rg-Arne Bias reported.
The concrete figures would now have to be calculated before the municipal authorities could inform their customers of the exact price increase next week.
"We are assuming an increase of 1 cent plus x", says Bias, with the figure more likely to be close to 2 cents.
Keep the lights on: watch for waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The circuit breaker in the street is not responding, or the light sign is defective.
What are you supposed to do, drive on red?
If a person has waited long enough at a red light and the intersection is clear, he can continue driving, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
The waiting time must be 'reasonable', which could be interpreted differently in each case.
Becker advises that you wait at least five minutes before you assume that the light is malfunctioning.
However, if you continue driving despite the red light, you must be aware that you are responsible for any accident that may occur.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the term 'competition' in the context of the directive on the protection of consumers.
In the case under consideration, after about three minutes of continuous red, a driver had ignored the traffic light and was held responsible for a carelessly violated red light.
The light was not faulty, but it turned green a short time later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
Municipal Council welcomes sound budget
Whenever the budget is discussed in city council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal budget in Herdwangen-Sch√∂nach is well-stocked and the administration has been free of debt since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be considered a success in this respect.
This was demonstrated in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts.
The Commission is also proposing a new budget line for the European Union, which would be based on the same principles as the one used by the European Council in Brussels.
The surplus on the administrative budget was also about EUR 1 million higher than the estimate, at about EUR 1 800 000.
The surplus was mainly due to higher income tax revenues and the municipal share of income tax.
The budget for assets was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the planned EUR 1.5 million, it amounted to EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher level of funding from the administrative budget", says Rothmund.
As the investments made in 2012 were lower than planned, the reserve was also higher.
The general reserve was increased by some EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and his team for their good work.
"You don't just shake a piece like that out of your sleeve", Gerster said, looking at the annual report.
He and the city council were clearly pleased about the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but these very good figures could soon come at a cost to the citizens.
The good financial situation of the municipality has allowed it to avoid high rates of interest in the past.
But this, according to Gerster, has already led to a number of cuts in subsidies from the country.
There are conditions for these grants from various compensation funds.
The Commission has also proposed that the Community should provide a financial contribution to the Community for the development of the fisheries sector.
"We have to look at the issue of special rates, because in the coming years there will be investments for which we would like to have subsidies", Gerster said.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter has been in the choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's history with the men's choir C√§cilia is almost twice as long as that of the Autumn Festival, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter was on stage in the colors of his men's choir as usual.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir, which he has come to love.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and his association he received several awards: J√∂rg Kohr, pastoral lecturer on behalf of the Cacilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - as the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard F√ºrst.
His fellow singers presented him with the certificate of the German Choral Association and an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the tribute, the 31st autumn festival took its usual course: With the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the Baisingen singers' department and the local music association, the Vollmaringer had a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the about 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with soulful songs like "Im Weinparadies" and "Fun, ihr Br√ºder".
They prepared a small piece in honour of their guest singer Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's choir Betra also sang classic choral songs such as "J√§gerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "Wann du durch durchgehn des Tales".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "Impulschor" - provided the female quota of the festival.
The mixed choir, with the Neapolitan folk style, abducted "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulchore" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The choir of the Baising Sportverein returned to their home territory with "Was isch der Schwob?" by Hans S√ºssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical finale.
For the children there was a small side programme - "Oma Hanne" aka Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read some stories, which kept the children busy during the lunch.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and day-care centres in the Zollernalbkreis receive mail these days.
The Black Forest Bote, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, would like to support the facilities in the realization of their building and beautification wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
The action is open to all kindergartens, day nurseries and cr√®ches in the entire district of Zollern.
If you have a building or beautification wish for your institution, you can apply with this to the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your kids and surprise the jury of the Kindergarten Construction Site action.
A jury, composed of representatives of Schwarzw√§lder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, will select three wishes from all the submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be fulfilled with building materials of a maximum value of EUR 2000 and in one (action) day.
In addition, the winner must provide for many hardworking construction workers.
What's with the action day and the helpers?
Bauhaus is providing the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the nursery school on the agreed day and then handled directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course the educators and the children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
We are in a scary situation and one may ask: What is stopping Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?, read the newspaper, which considers the draft law unconstitutional.
"The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it", said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal ¬ìwill always be biased because it is an extension of the government¬î, and restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's standing in the global economy.
'I hope the President hears us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament' he said.
The Star newspaper said the new law effectively "strangles the media", while The Standard said democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had "suffered a severe blow", calling the bill "draconian".
The passage of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
Kenyan media outlets drew the ire of authorities after publishing security camera footage of the alleged robbery of the luxury shopping mall by the police.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a leading media figure for questioning, although the summons was withdrawn after a media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, and risk losing their professional recognition or being barred from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "a single penalty can bankrupt most radio stations".
Furthermore, the newspaper believes these measures could have a devastating effect on what it describes as Kenya's "vibrant blogosphere".
If they can silence the media, politicians can do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know", wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the Nation, who calls the Kenyan media a crucial controlling factor in public life.
"If politicians are left to their own devices, they will lead the country to bankruptcy and take us back to the days of hunters and gatherers", he said.
Kenyan lawmakers have incurred public outrage in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts mandated by the National Remuneration Commission and restore their hefty salaries of about 532,000 shillings per month tax-free - among the highest in the world.
Bad-D√ºrrheim: a dream come true for the FC
The official inauguration of the artificial turf field, despite the cold weather and the rain, was of no consequence to the importance of the town and the football club.
Everyone had wished for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter refused to join in.
So were all those who came without umbrellas or who for some reason could not keep one.
The musicians who performed the opening act felt that way, as did many of the speakers.
That is why FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker was also wet, and he spoke of a dream come true.
He thanked the Mayor Walter Klumpp, who had been very involved in the implementation of the project, the City Council, the companies involved and the members of the association who had contributed.
Here especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The hardworking retirees laid out 1,300 square feet [400 sq m] of paving for the new roads.
The German parliament member Karl Rombach also paid tribute to this remarkable voluntary commitment.
Further greetings were given by the city sports committee, Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Bad football association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the club's youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that the weather conditions in spring and autumn had made the original lawn unplayable.
The first suggestions for solving the problem were made 15 years ago, when the idea of building a third course near the football club or the Realschule on the Salinensee was considered.
Both were rejected.
Six years ago, the idea of a synthetic turf sports field was born, and it was widely considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning was started two years ago when FC took over the lease of the Schabelstube in Erb, agreed to share the costs of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the site and the Land approved subsidies of EUR 104 000.
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 of the total cost of EUR 560 000, summarised Klumpp.
The construction of the 68 by 108 meter artificial grass court began on June 4.
During the construction phase, which lasted for over three months, 3000 cubic metres of earth were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike path.
The Union and the SPD continued their coalition negotiations on the subjects of the Interior and Justice.
The working party responsible met in Berlin in the morning.
The issues include direct democracy, the corruption of MPs and the Federal Police.
The working party on migration and integration also wanted to continue its deliberations in the morning.
The Commission has also proposed to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the term 'common carrier' to cover all other vehicles.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
The Socialist Group has voted in favour of the amendment to the directive on the protection of workers from the risks arising from exposure to asbestos.
The Commission is also proposing that the European Parliament should be given the right to vote in the Council of Ministers, and that the Council should be given the right to vote in the European Parliament.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of the health and safety of workers in the event of the occurrence of a serious accident is a very important one.
The introduction of a toll for all passenger cars would, in Pronold's view, be only a first step.
"There is a risk that compensation for Germans will be abolished at a later date", he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing of the F√∂hnwelle on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was not the question on Friday evening on the open air stage Killesberg.
It was a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So, the best conditions for hit-star Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Motorists seriously injured in an accident
A car crash on Thursday night left a 37-year-old Aachen driver seriously injured.
According to police, a 41-year-old woman was driving from M√ºsch to Grefrath at 21.15 on the Kempen Outer Ring.
As she was trying to make a left on St. Tonis Road, she overlooked the oncoming car of the 37-year-old.
The wheels collided.
The Aachen resident suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
Constance: Blocking after an accident on the tailpipe
Police said the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza was driving out of town on the left lane of the two-lane Reichstra√üe on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m.
Shortly before the roundabout at the Sch√§nzle, he noticed that he was on the left siding in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstra√üe and changed to the right lane.
The accident was caused by a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanz driver.
Also damaged was a 19-year-old's VW Passat driving behind the BMW.
The police said that there was a total of about 15,000 property damage.
The road had to be closed during the accident, it said.
Vienna airport abolishes passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In future, there will be no more such statements at Vienna-Schwechat airport.
This eliminates much of the loudspeaker noise - the noise level is thus significantly reduced.
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Wien, the suspension of announcements concerning individual persons at Vienna Airport follows an international trend.
The airport in Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Dubai, for example, are already refraining from using the noisy telephone.
The removal of these announcements - on average, about 200 personal calls are made through the loudspeakers each day - should make things more quiet at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual announcements were perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flight boarding or departure times is also lost here a bit", Kleemann said in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake-tractor-car-race, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander games will start at 1:30.
They may have a Scottish tradition, but they're very Swabian in the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual competitors compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water-skiing.
The tree trunk is 13 feet (4.5 m) long and weighs between 25 and 30 kilograms.
"It doesn't matter how far", says organiser Peter Saile.
The log must be thrown straight down, turned over once, and then come straight to rest.
That's the one with the most points.
When you're a horseshoe thrower, it's all about accuracy.
From eight meters away, he is thrown onto a stake.
The contestants must demonstrate skill and strength in carrying a water container over 50 meters.
And the amount of water in a vat is measured at the end.
Two members of each clan or team may then compete in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
You can start training at 10:00.
Suitable clothing is desirable, for example, the competitors can compete in the Schottenrock.
But even weak-skinned suits are allowed.
For "Outfit", the jury will award a few bonus points.
Registration is one hour before the race.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander Games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour early, there's a lot of action on the mainland on Saturday.
At night, the music friends come on their own.
At 7 p.m. the music of Sch√∂mberg will be the main entertainment.
The band plays polkas and marches.
But their repertoire also includes soulful waltzes and a rich big-band sound.
The singing host and the Black Wurst Baron Heinz Koch from Weilen unter den Rinnen will be there.
He's already been to the Christmas market in Dornhan and the Fool's House.
On Sundays, the music club hosts Leinstetten for early drinking, and from 2 p.m. the peasant band B√∂ffingen is the guest, and the "Oldies" then let the festival end.
The stop-and-go party with DJ Ralf starts on Friday.
Other events on Saturday and Sunday include the Oldtimer and Tractor Meeting, and exhibitions of companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other Sunday attractions include the corn maze, the artisan market, and the sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, a straw-hop castle, tractor driving (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the association of the multi-purpose hall, the ski club and the tractor friends "Z√ºndkapsel".
Milk and egg alternatives in the spotlight
Vegan diets require plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Pure tofu with vegetable oil is a quark substitute, for example.
The Vegetarian League also calls November 1 World Vegetarian Day.
The German Vegetarian Federation is proposing a number of vegan alternatives on the occasion of World Vegetarian Day on 1 November:
Pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, so let's replace yoghurt with soy yoghurt.
Soya, oat, almond or rice milk could be used instead of milk.
The use of vegetable spreads replaces conventional spreads.
There are plant-based alternatives to eggs.
A half-crushed ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binding agent in a cake.
Also, 50 grams of apple juice or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed and three tablespoons of water are suitable.
Looser dough is made instead of using eggs, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But 50 grams of soy yogurt or silken tofu can also do the trick.
According to Vebu, some 800 000 people in Germany are currently vegan, or purely plant-based.
Sleepless in New York City
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest High School were introduced to the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we headed straight for the Brooklyn Bridge, which we walked to the heart of the city, Manhattan.
Here, one could already admire the world-famous skyline, which is particularly appealing in the evening light.
The time shift left the students up and running for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The City Never Sleeps", the day was decided in Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, the Statue of Liberty was reached by ferry and climbed on foot on the second day.
Then it went from the financial center to Wall Street to the 9/11 Memorial.
On the third day, from the 1,205-foot-high [373 m] observation deck of the Empire State Building, the students were able to enjoy a panoramic view of the fascinating city.
Then we drove through the bustling streets of New York City, past Rockefeller Center, and onto Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for a brief stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived at their host families and are experiencing the school night at Weymouth High School.
This year, on the name day of Saint Hubertus, a Hubertus Mass is celebrated in the parish church of St. Marien on H√ºlsbergstrasse.
St. Hubertus was the legendary, rather ruthless hunter, who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Li√®ge.
The jagdhornbl√§sergruppe of the Jagddreier Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth musicizes on Parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) according to old, originally French melodies.
The horsemen wear riding clothes because they are the principal musical accompaniment for riders, horses, and dog teams on trailers.
The solemn mass will be held on Sunday, November 3, at 11:30 a.m.
The newly designed front door is glittering with a new cafe.
One that invites us to stay and return.
One who wants to make the name the program.
D√©j√† vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed by the feeling that a new situation has already been experienced or seen.
In the case of the visit to the caf√© of the same name at Opschlag in the county town of Kleve in sight of the Rhein-Waal University, it does not have to remain with the pure D√©j√† Vu feeling.
After all, that is precisely what the caf√© with its beautiful name aims to do: to make a real stay not only in the mind, but in the hands, a recurring experience.
Because it's fun and it's beautiful.
A look inside the 8th house gives the viewer a good feeling at first.
The ultra-modern, but not cool, caf√© environment looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team, led by founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel B√ºttner, spoils the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
And there's delicious cake or individually wrapped fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, had already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before the opening of the ornate caf√© on the upper part of the square: in Kranenburg they ran the "Art Lounge".
The move to Kleve to the Opschlag is a move that the sympathetic caf√© lovers hope will bring more audiences.
Not least through the university.
"We do not have a specific target group", says Daniel B√ºttner.
Rather, these two want to appeal to young students as much as to seniors and all the ages in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The lovely couple behind the coffee pleasure.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in its various variations.
Other
Daniel B√ºttner is more of an espresso drinker and Mirjam van der Stelt is more of a cappuccino drinker.
"I'm into baguettes", she told the NRZ.
There were two events at the Hellen Caf√©.
More like one.
Because the harbour party was held outside - the Caf√© D√©j√† Vu didn't benefit from it.
But there was also the night of the wrestling.
"Beautiful, successful and funny", said the two 33-year-olds.
But not just anyone's.
Perhaps that's why Daniel B√ºttner isn't a big fan of event nights: "You can't please everyone".
And with an event, I only ever address those who are also interested in that particular event.
Which is why events are going to be the exception here.
"We want to disrupt normal operations as little as possible".
I guess D√©j√† Vu is also a word for reliability.
The quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the warehouse in Kleve.
The street, which is becoming more and more a food street.
To the delight of many clever people, guests from near and far and students who discover the gastronomic district and thus the Caf√© D√©j√† Vu.
The following table is added:
A day of thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation party to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had come gladly.
In the club hall of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious togetherness of the music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Day is also the appropriate celebration to pay tribute.
The special award "Singer of the Year" was given to the writer Rolf Wagener.
"You have not only written a lot for us, but also shot many rounds for us, for which we sincerely thank you", says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choral rehearsals by means of activity gowns went this year to the choral director Dieter Schulze with 44 participation, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participation each.
The fifth place was taken by goalkeeper Artur Br√ºckner.
The board of directors paid special thanks to the team of hostess Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again created a menu of the highest class, and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choral rehearsals every Tuesday at 19.45 in the clubhouse.
"We welcome new, joyful voices to sing at any time", says Schlotmann.
UN announces new goals to fight poverty
The United Nations is now starting to work out a set of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction, which were announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which kicked off in Rio de Janeiro this evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for the 'sustainable development goals' to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which are due to expire in 2015.
They have been included in the final draft of the document which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, said at the summit that the time had come to "think beyond national interests".
'I am glad that the Member States have agreed to start a process to agree on universal sustainable development goals,' he said.
These goals will build on our progress under the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals.
Even though SG Achim/Baden have been without a win for four days, the handball-Oberligisten are still in a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated.
But I hope we can win again.
"I don't know what a victory like that tastes like anymore", Malmon expects his team to be successful at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-tier reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet uprooted any trees, Malmon is warning in advance.
I trained a lot of players myself in the A-team.
So they're gonna be very motivated to go up against their ex-coach.
"We also have to wait and see if there are any reinforcements from the first", explains the SG-Coach.
To finally get back on the winning track, the Malmon team has to step up from where they were in the past.
The cover-up and the switch-up were the last things that went terribly wrong.
The use of opportunities must also be improved.
So I hope that my players have finally cleared their heads during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow amid clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique, to echo calls for peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability", said Vanessa de Sousa, a manager of an investment firm.
Fearing for the country's future, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For the past two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement was signed over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, supported initially by white-ruled Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace agreement of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts say it is unlikely that the country will revert to full-scale conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals alike.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal deposits in the Northwest could bring in over $50 billion in investment over the next few years from firms such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Frelimo party, which has been the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamo stronghold, on October 17.
Attacks on former rebels escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo's spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a "loser" who "wants to use his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
But concerns have grown since Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to start negotiations again, and we will do so seriously", said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions that have been fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are head-to-head", says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them are good at negotiating and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reform, has already announced it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a grassroots movement to win concessions and financial favors from the government.
Renamo's electoral successes have been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democr√°tico de Mo√ßambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency", Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capabilities Renamo has, but it has carried out disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south link.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but Beira is located in the port, which is used by mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga was reluctant to answer the question whether Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique", Mazanga said.
The instability has added to frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people are already worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnappings.
People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems, he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
'Nobody is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads,' he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "life models", says one author.
The stories of Thor showed that brute force has no chance against clever tricks, and the Arthurian legend demonstrates the importance of having a dream.
Many of the myths, however, were "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools", and Crossley-Holland called for a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education", he said.
I've been suggesting this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that children were "completely turned off" by authors and teachers who were "overly didactic", because in entertaining stories the messages were "under-exposed".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, stated: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background if possible".
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer writing for adults and a writer writing for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of right and wrong.
It must be subtle, revealed by history, not explained.
It's the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob is moving to Freihof again
One hundred years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob retired to Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were spent in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely entertaining scene.
From his arrival to the award of honorary citizenship until his death, scriptwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining play, which received much acclaim under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained the connections and bridged the gaps between youth and the approaching retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hans Jacob returned to his childhood home in his backyard.
And then the scene began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his paradox role as the great son of the city.
He was the first to win the Stilecht with the Zweispanner and the "Schwarzw√§lder F√ºchsen" by Erich Becherer from M√ºhlenbach.
Not only was he greeted with applause by the audience, but his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann was incredibly good at putting himself in the role of the sister and gave her a tremendous life in her facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual scenes, the M√ºhlenbach Peasant Band played appropriately selected pieces of music and rounded out the performance.
The honor of awarding the honorary citizenship was then given to Haslachs Mayor Heinz Winkler, who made his appearance on behalf of the then office holder H√§ttich together with part of the city council.
The three kings then joined the singers, prompting Hansjakob to exclaim: "Oh, how beautiful, here again young memories of my own Three Kings come alive".
They delighted the audience in the courtyard with their song "O Jesulein" as well as the Storchentagskinder with their loud "Heraus, Heraus".
Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church at the time, as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
He found his resting place in his motherland, behind his chapel on the hearth at Hofstetten.
"A troubled spirit had finally found its rest and gone home for good", the scene concluded.
The audience applauded the performance with many words of praise.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar Giants is growing
The chances of the retired Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players to stay in the league have increased.
Because if there is a wild card process, then there is now one less competitor for the Neckar Giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project is not applying for a possible back-up spot.
'We will not participate in the wildcard process', said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been developing the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
But the first sigh of relief was not heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't bother with the wildcard procedure until it was clear that D√ºsseldorf would not get a licence", Neckar giant boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Up to 23 May, Aufsteiger D√ºsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitration court and prove his economic fitness for the Bundesliga.
The Rhine-landers have been denied the licence twice.
The arbitration is the final court of appeal.
Haigerloch: the Church of the Holy Supper is in the spotlight
As part of the city's contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourist office will dedicate the last of its public themed tours this year on Sunday, 27 October, to the Church of the Holy Eucharist.
After visiting the Atomkeller-Museum, the Haigerloch period should be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The culmination of the visit is a visit to the Church of the Holy Communion.
There, the leaders are told the story of the building of the church and gain insight into the development of the Evangelical community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also has a view of the painting of the Last Supper, created by Friedrich Sch√ºz with the support of Walter Kr√∂ll and Georg Halbritter.
It is a faithful reproduction of the famous Milanese model by Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the second half-hour tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomkeller Museum.
Tickets are available at the Atomic Basement Museum.
The tourist office of the town of Haigerloch is available for questions and information.
Snowden could testify in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could testify in the U.S. intelligence affair from his Russian asylum.
The prosecutor's office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
The Interfax news agency reported this, citing unnamed sources familiar with the situation.
The Commission has already taken action in this area.
Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status", the agency quoted its source.
The EU is also committed to the principle of subsidiarity, which is the basis of the EU's policy on the protection of human rights.
Long-windedness pays off
Six men's teams competed in the club tennis tournament for the winner's title.
In the end, the endurance of the team Maier/Bronner decided the final match.
A dream had been given to the tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf for the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was the main focus of the tournament.
There were five games per team scheduled, with each team playing each other.
Played in double mode with one long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter is running the tournament .
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen M√ºller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were tied with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler), so that the last two matches had to be decided.
In the final, Carmen M√ºller was able to finally hand the Wanderpokal to Andre Maier / Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was taken by the Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic double.
The bronze staircase was reached by Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphalt Trace Team.
Late afternoon sun and coffee and cake was the winning outcome of the tournament.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwald open-air museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in the hands of children.
The museum traditionally welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24 and 25, as part of the summer holiday programme for a colourful children's and family party with numerous participation actions and events.
"Both adults and children can learn various old crafts on both days", says the press release.
Whether it's making soap, spinning candles, filing, or making rope, there's something for every age.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum workshop is also used for work.
By building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or whirlwinds, the young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship.
Many old-fashioned games, such as wheelbarrow racing and steeplechasing, also promise to be fun.
Speed and coordination are required.
For all the little detectives, the Open Air Museum offers a guided tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday at 12 and 2 p.m. respectively.
On a fun run, the children must guess which stories are true and which are lies.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the premises.
In addition, all children can look forward to Sunday's Clown Otsch, who will be doing his schabernack with the museum guests from 11 a.m.

Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They're distributing the coal from the ships to the flotilla.
The company has several iron in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard also relies on wind turbine logistics.
Black is the coal on the storage site in front of the dam.
Two huge blue coal-burning and back-loading machines distribute or reload the coal here as needed.
Every movement of the switchgear sends a squeaking alarm across the terrain.
"The signals are for security and are required by law", says Matthias Schrell, the manager of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, with the winds being unfavorable, this can be heard everywhere - and there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes complaints very seriously and has therefore been in contact with the people affected, says the 40-year-old.
The Commission is now working with the authorities to reduce the warning signals by means of technical measures.
It will continue to rely on open dialogue with its neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell has some things to do at the site.
With the extension of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power stations and is one of the major players in Europe in this sector.
The terminal is equipped with a 18.5 metre deep storage tank, which has made it possible to discharge Capesize bulk carriers.
"This year we want to break the 3 million tonnes mark in the handling of goods", said Mr Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on the spot, the imported coal goes to power plants inland.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is connected to the grid, it is realistic to import 5 million tonnes of coal per year.
The three shiploaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could generate up to 10 million.
Bavarian basketball player optimistic despite first loss
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not reduce the huge optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us to believe that we can win against the best team in Europe in the past two years", Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night against defending champions Olympiakos Pir√§us.
We sent the message: There is basketball in Munich too!
In their third appearance in the European premier class, the Munich team sold very well for a long time, but were simply not cleared up enough in the decisive phases.
The visitors first managed to convert a 15-point deficit into a lead with 13 minutes to go before Pir√§us turned the game around again.
"We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then we made careless mistakes again", said Bayern pro Yassin Idbihi.
We're proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers of the Munich team, who had won clear victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zielona G√≥ra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker is a comedy festival that is held every year in New York City.
You could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Nearly a century ago, the vaudeville artist Frank Fay, who worked as a keynote speaker at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the audience in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, which was founded and is run by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
'Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were too well known to perform in a club,' said Hirsch.
We conceived this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year's event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy benefit for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, which features Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of the comedians participating in this year's festival have made their mark through more unconventional avenues, including appearances on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his name on a cable television sitcom (the ironically slippery fantasy football series The League on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member on both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, though she is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, race-focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralised world of American comedy.
Among the festival's biggest draws is an interview with David Steinberg with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian but has evolved into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television show titled Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg on TV Land.
The meeting will be held at Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work", Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, sometimes he walks down the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here".
Iran satisfied with process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is a week away from the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany is satisfied with the negotiating process.
"After years, we have reached an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of the last years", Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
The Commission has also taken a number of steps to ensure that the EU's nuclear programme is not disrupted by the threat of nuclear accidents.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill fellow players with machetes
Two children in Uruguay have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old boy.
The two boys, 14 and 12 years old, had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper El Pa√≠s reported on Thursday.
They would then play football outside their apartments in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger boy they had taken with them was to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
When the girl described the incident to the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted to the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
One reason the elder gave was a rivalry in a football game.
He was temporarily committed to a psychiatric institution for juveniles.
Pimp has to go to jail
For the crime of trafficking, pimping, threats, insults and dangerous physical injury, the regional court of Constance has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. George to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who after two deployments in Afghanistan worked as a doorman, made a confession during a trial hearing.
In five cases, he had met women through Internet or telephone contacts, whom he had sent to the strip against their will after a few weeks.
He used violence and threats to break down resistance.
He kept the income of the women, some of whom had worked for him for years.
By confiscating cell phones and SIM cards, he prevented the women from contacting the outside world.
He and a colleague who arranged the women's services took them to various brothels in the Southwest.
There he had them monitored, in part, to control their income.
In court, the defendant initially claimed he was suffering from severe trauma after a co-worker was killed in an explosion in Afghanistan.
After a psychiatric examiner raised serious doubts about the mental impairment and thus the limited capacity for guilt, the 33-year-old made a full confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women.
According to a Kripo official, telephone surveillance has revealed at least four other cases of exploitative trafficking after a first report.
The intercepted conversations were characterized by a high degree of aggression.
In later interrogations, the injured would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, one of the women who had bruises all over her body, has not yet come forward.
It is a "totally broken personality" that considers violence and exploitation in this profession as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He wanted to break free from these circles and lead a normal life after his imprisonment", he said.
Oil prices continue to fall to $96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The benchmark crude oil grade for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in late morning electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in Europe.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, which was a 5.8 percent drop in October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In the course of five weeks, supply had risen by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were signs of stronger demand from two reports of increased activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China's economy, which grew to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude oil, a benchmark for international crude oil used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
Court blocks decision on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy
A federal appeals court in the US on Thursday blocked the order of a judge who had demanded changes to the New York Police Department's Stop-and-Frisk program, dismissing the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it would suspend Judge Shira Scheindlin's ruling until the city's appeal is decided.
The judge ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution by the way it implemented the program for detaining and questioning people.
The City appealed against its assessment and the remedies ordered, including the decision to establish a monitoring unit to assist the police in changing their policy and the corresponding training programme.
The appeals court heard arguments on Tuesday to suspend the appeal.
The Appeals Report stated that the judge should be dismissed from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges, which states that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality, based in part on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly reacted to the court's criticism.
The judge had found that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by inappropriately targeting black and Latino men with the Stop-and-Frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including policy reforms, training and staff oversight, and set up a pilot programme of body-worn cameras in the neighbourhoods where most of the checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who were discharged after a police check.
A hearing on the City's appeal is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic was criticized by a number of civil rights activists.
Such checks have been around for decades in various forms, but the number of recorded checks during the tenure of nonpartisan Mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Hispanic men.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonged to minorities, filed a lawsuit that developed into a class action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's Stop-and-Frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as affect the way other police departments implement the system.
Opponents argue that the changes would dampen police morale but not crime; would waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force under pressure after the loss of thousands of jobs over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that she was not ending the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but was merely reforming the way the NYPD enforces its controls.
From the luck of the dreaming camel
Happiness is an oasis that only camels dream of reaching
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman, Wolfgang Henne, described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon the tenth anniversary of the association was celebrated, which can already have considerable successes.
The first chairman, Mr Henne, gave a detailed account of the work of the association.
He himself visited Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
Subsequently, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the operations were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get an idea of the actions mentioned.
The association's desert vehicle was also shown.
It's a former federal border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former Nagold's OB, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to work in an advisory capacity for the association.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a slum on the outskirts of the capital, in a record time of just under a week - on a voluntary basis.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting at a time when Nagold is rationing the maternity hospital.
Henne says that there is a lot to learn in Africa as a medical doctor, such as slowing down against burnout.
Because of the political unrest in the country, many trips were not made as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to work in various fields.
In addition, containers of equipment are regularly being sent to Africa, including medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March of this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local color, telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into mobile goat stables and describing the experiences of the local musicians who traditionally support the association during their trip to Mauritania.
He said that the Commission had not yet been able to reach a decision on the matter, but that it was not yet able to take a decision on the matter.
When he realized how much money was being lost on the road, he decided to help Africans with the control of a budget by the people.
The European Union is a global economic powerhouse.
It should also be borne in mind that Africa is closer than some people think.
From Gran Canaria, it's not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to verify a tip
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair by then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that the News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was having an affair with his 'attractive special adviser' Hannah Pawlby.
The paper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Paulby's voice mail and stalked her, but Coulson also called her and left messages, the court heard.
"The prosecution believes that Coulson, now editor of NotW, is not someone who stands outside people's homes and hopes to catch them in the act, but someone who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction", Edis explained.
He said that NotW uses three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
He obviously knows about the second one, the surveillance, or it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "If only he knew".
Rumors of a Clarke affair were first picked up by the NotW feature editorial staff when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles".
A tape containing voice mails from her phone from at least three occasions was secured at Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
During the investigation, Edis said, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about him.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voice mail saying, "I have a story we're going to publish tomorrow that I'd like to talk to Charles about".
Edis explained that Coulson's activities on this story followed the same pattern as other important figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Blunkett about having an affair with a married woman when he was himself having an affair with co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have all admitted to hacking their phones.
In fact, in protest against the proposed tax on the wealth of the country, French football will go on strike for the first time since 1972.
A mediation meeting ends without result.
In the conflict over the imperial tax, the government and professional football in France have entered a dead end after a failed arbitration meeting.
President Hollande received representatives of associations and associations at the √âlys√©e Palace in Paris on Thursday and listened to their complaints.
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75 percent levy on income of more than one million euros a year, which all firms in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side remained hard.
The strike, which was announced for the end of November, will now be carried out, said the head of the Union of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The matchdays scheduled between 29 November and 2 December in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are therefore not included.
Gechingen: No absolute protection is possible
"We want to involve the residents in planning at an early stage", Mayor Jens H√§u√üler said at the opening of the flood protection concept event in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the town hall to find out about the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and contribute ideas.
He said: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
The flood that hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009 was a major event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, according to H√§usler.
A river area survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The aim is to protect as many building plots as possible", says H√§usler.
The basis is the planning of protection against a flood which, according to the German Meteorological Service, is expected to occur every 100 years.
Climate change is covered by a 15 percent surcharge.
In the technical community, this is known as "HQ 100aKlima".
The floods that caused considerable damage in Gecheng in 2009 were equivalent to a flood that had occurred over a thousand years.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement", says H√§u√üler.
To achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, about four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality being able to count on about 70% of the funds coming from the state.
However, Mr H√§u√üler pointed out that the funding would only be available if an overall approach was implemented.
The Commission's proposal is to be submitted to the Council by the end of the year.
The Commission has already made a number of recommendations to the Member States.
The best case scenario is to start implementation in 2016.
The protection concept, which was presented last week at the municipal council (we reported), includes local measures in the valley of the river Irm, which flows from the Stammheim valley.
After the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to express their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why more dams and reservoirs were not planned to protect the site.
Gregor K√ºhn, specialist planner at the engineering firm Wald und Corbe in H√ºgelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasised that it required the combination of all the measures presented to achieve the desired result.
The Commission's proposal is based on the principle of subsidiarity, which is not a requirement of the Treaty.
Residents near the shrine were angry, as even during normal thunderstorms the canal network is repeatedly overloaded.
The problem is known to the administration and the first steps have already been taken.
However, H√§usler pointed out that the guidelines for canal systems are different from those for flood protection and that these should not be mixed.
The municipality was obliged to design the canal network in such a way that two to three years of rain could be borne.
To increase the size of the sewers would consume millions.
Seriously Injured After Collision
Two motorists were seriously injured in a head-on collision on the national road 44 near Revensdorf early Friday afternoon.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could not say much about the accident.
However, there are several eyewitness accounts that should be evaluated first.
It is known that the 19-year-old woman was driving a VW Golf towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came up to her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman so badly trapped that it took the fire department nearly half an hour to free her from the wreckage.
The exact cause of the accident remained unclear.
Both victims were taken to nearby hospitals.
The line was completely closed for about two hours.
You could call him the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a god-sinner, a metaphysician, and his novels and stories have a serial quality.
The close relationship in appearance is astonishing: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, so is Philip K. Dick to be read as an American prophet, who is quite something in his own country.
Some titles have been published by the Heyne publishing house, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories sells two thousand.
Dick describes America as the realm of breathtaking technological advancement, coupled with paranoia, security mania and the belief that it was chosen.
Dick had experiences with God, and his late books read like a mixture of the Book of Revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs in his brain.
He realized early on that computers are divine.
He wrote a theology of the computer, asking what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
That's the problem with Blade Runner.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The Minority Report was written in 1956 and it has the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunals.
It's the pre-crime principle that's being developed here, pre-crime, which is now more or less official White House doctrine.
In Dick's world, which is eerily similar to ours, mutants are looking into the future and the police are closing in.
"We are arresting individuals who have not broken any law", says the head of the agency.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime".
And, "We don't have any major criminals in our society, but we have a prison camp full of pesoduro robbers". They read time streams.
They assume bad things will happen and prevent the criminal thought from being put into action.
Dick's story seems like the blueprint for the anti-terrorism laws and the NSA bugging.
Anticipating the attack: that's how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story is not over.
The chief of police complains that there is no longer a separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor is himself monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system is spinning.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It's inventing its own conditions.
It not only accepts mistakes and sacrifices, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick is getting closer to the truth, again and again.
Spying on Merkel in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also testify in his Russian asylum in the US spy case against German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, Interfax reported.
Earlier, Green MP Hans-Christian Str√∂bele had yesterday become the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow to discuss the affair with him.
NSA disclosures reinforce corporate paranoia about government surveillance
On a mild day in late August, a German police helicopter flew over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
On instructions from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German secret service, he was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media reports claim that the BVT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or profits.
But since Edward Snowden, the former employee turned whistleblower, began releasing his trove of U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure they can take the director at his word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency has been spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has obtained data from US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have raised corporate paranoia about government surveillance to a new high.
The barrel overflowed with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then surely corporate executives are potential targets.
Snowden has made the intense cooperation between US intelligence agencies and corporations transparent.
I think it's conceivable that this data could be used for mutual benefit.
'Germany must wake up', says Oliver Gr√ºn, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT firms in Germany.
German companies now believe the US is almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consultancy firm EY.
But the documents leaked by Snowden have so far provided no evidence that the US has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly ...
"That's not how it works", says Hasso Plattner, chairman of German software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, we should not have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything but the IT business.
Still, the reach and technical sophistication of the U.S. intelligence agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations has shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest spy risk in China.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing, as European business leaders are becoming more aware that data stored in the US is subject to US jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, about ten percent of non-US-based members discarded plans to use an American provider after the revelations about US data mining activities with Prism.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We're seeing a new question from customers that didn't exist a year ago. It's: Where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that legal space?"
Many German business leaders feel that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore must guard them at all costs.
It's no surprise that economic espionage is taking place.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally as a result of the current discussion", says Kurt Bock, chairman of BASF, the chemical company.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The management does not usually boast about the countermeasures it has taken, because this gives the attackers an advantage.
Employees in large companies have long been told that it is not advisable to take a free USB stick to a trade fair or to leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at the car manufacturer Audi, says that for years it has been standard practice to collect cell phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as a listening device.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad, as smartphones can potentially be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized businesses remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets from unauthorised access, warns the BTW in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate in February ranked France, Russia and Israel as the second most important countries behind China for the acquisition of economic data from hacking.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of French intelligence agency DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: "The intelligence agencies know very well that all countries, even when they work together in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies".
Hechingen: The fair answers questions about weddings
"Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that man can undertake", said philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard.
Tips on how to make the wedding a success have been given at a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important vendors around a wedding.
One trend: the retro look has made a comeback.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White must be best served over ice or in cream.
The garments, often fringed and embroidered, are closed at the front, often with a veil, while at the back they go down the back and often end in a drape.
But the spirits are separated, as Stefanie Koch of the fashion house Kleiderm√ºller emphasizes.
Men's suits are predominantly vest-and-plaster, but you can also choose cream or brown combinations.
The choice of the place was important, they said.
Unadorned rooms are not ideal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain made its own offer in the booth.
If you want to go with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer.
"But coaches are also popular for young people to get along", he says.
Romanticism is also in demand for greeting cards, flower arrangements, and even for wedding pictures.
More and more people are taking "after-wedding photographs" - series of pictures taken in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the wedding, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the Domene.
Flower arrangements, rings, wedding table, cake, and even a magician, like Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for a party to remember.
Dog Friends Successfully
Once again, the athletes of the Dog Friends Bitz were successful in a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy, he scored 94 points in the beginner class and secured the fifth place, and with the 15 month old Marley he brought it with 87 points to twelfth place.
Susi H√∂pp faced the critical gaze of the performance judge with her Woody in the first grade.
Parents of a Georgia teenager who died in a tragic accident believe he was murdered
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a rolled-up ring mat in his high school gym are convinced their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in an upright mat behind the grandstand in the gymnasium.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family has cast doubt on this.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered", Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
You would never have believed he died the way the sheriff concluded he did.
'They believe that it is illogical, that it goes against the laws of physics and common sense,' Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
'Her son went to school to learn and came back in a body bag,' he says.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death as a number of important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for a formal inquiry, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died from "positional asphyxiation".
A second autopsy, however, revealed a different cause of death, Moore said.
'There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,' he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence to launch a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would have the FBI conduct the investigation.
A representative from the county sheriff's department was not immediately available for comment following our request Thursday.
A court in south Georgia ordered Wednesday that the authorities release all surveillance videos that investigators have reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video recordings would provide clues as to how he died.
CDC publishes allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines for handling food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-age children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock  the EpiPen brand auto-injection is the most commonly used  to counteract a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
State legislators recently changed the rules to make it easier for schools to stockpile epinephrine.
The report also lists typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels like something is pressing on my tongue", "My tongue feels like a hair is on it", or "My tongue is tingling".
Parents of intersex children can choose Gender undefined
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with non-unique genitalia.
Newborns are no longer assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare the gender of such children, but can indicate "indeterminate" or "not defined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take pressure off parents so they don't have to make hasty decisions regarding sex-reassignment surgery for newborn babies, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
Years later, an intersex person told the BBC: "I am neither a man nor a woman".
I remain the patchwork that doctors have created, mutilated and scarred.
It is estimated that one out of every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, a group diagnosed with "sexual differentiation disorder" (SDD), a term used to describe people with atypical chromosomes, ovarian glands, or abnormally developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US advise using the best available information for gender assignment if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the child's psychological and physical development before deciding on surgery, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law "is looking for a good thing".
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but most children do not, he said.
You could perform a sex reassignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the mystery of why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not gender-related but is determined by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were expressed in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys who don't match their gender image now have a special camp.
Meanwhile, in Australia and Nepal, adults can now specify on official documents as male, female or 'third gender'.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby, 52, was recognised as the world's first 'genderless' person, after a court granted her lifelong maintenance of 'undetermined' gender status.
German ID cards will have a third designation in addition to M and W, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French parliamentarians from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition demanding that "gender theory" be removed from school textbooks.
The US website Catholic Online also spoke out against the German law, saying: "If the world is dragged into a new state where sex is a choice and sexual activity is not, we are twisting two more pillars of civilization".
The mother of a newborn in Maryland told Baby Zone that she would prefer that babies be assigned a sex at birth.
"Parenting is stressful enough without any additional restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child", she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sex organs were called hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
As recently as ten years ago, medicine viewed sex as something that could be erased and then re-created.
But now the ethics of surgery are being questioned, now that we know how complex gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they don't know how a child feels growing up with the sex they've assigned.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" Drescher said.
When such a child was born, the surgeon was called, not the psychiatrist.
The prevailing theory on the treatment of children with non-clear genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender is malleable.
He coined the term gender identity and argued that social and environmental cues how parents raise a child interacted with a child's genes and hormones and thus shaped whether a person saw themselves as male or female.
However, in a case in 1966 known as John/Joan, his theories were controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed by a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely and remove his testicles as well, and then raise him as a girl.
Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which it was not, says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he changed back to the male gender and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sexual operations have come out to the public who are not happy with the outcome.
Jim Bruce, for example, is a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were unsure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after he was born in 1976, and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
"I knew I was not a girl", he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was supposed to have a vaginal repair.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to develop genitalia.
After learning the truth, he changed back to his male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
The surgery made him infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called the Interface Project to make intersex people feel normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based advocacy group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law could "encourage stigmatization and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a 'non-fixed' child", she said.
We fear that this will encourage intervention.
We think it's better to assign the male or female and then wait.
But we don't know yet what the law will do, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognized as a third gender".
Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender, she said.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight that you should force on little kids at this time.
When they're grown, they can decide for themselves about their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist in Pittsburgh who has a daughter with sexual dysfunction and who supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law "empowers" both parents and children.
Katie, Baratz's daughter, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect in the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, Katie is 29 years old, married, and she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a clinical associate in child psychiatry.
Although she is barren, she hopes to have a child by adoption or a surrogate mother.
The law gives parents room to make decisions without rushing through,said Baratz.
It gives them time to do different tests and clarify things, and it gives them time before they write "male" or "female".
That way everything is fine. You raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you're enjoying the happiness of parenthood.
And you don't have to rush into an irreversible surgery.
This involves the children in the decision and removes the fear that parents are running around because they feel they are not doing the right thing, she said.
Ultimately, the child decides which gender is best for him, and that's wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision for themselves.
Unknown gunshot wounded girl
Unknown gunmen have injured a 12-year-old girl in Saxony-Anhalt.
The perpetrators had fired at a group of children in Genthin on Thursday evening, presumably with an air gun.
That's what the police said at the castle.
The girl was slightly injured in the left thigh.
Paramedics took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had stopped abruptly.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A glass broke.
Then they drove off.
The Crime Squad is investigating, it was announced on Friday.
So far, the police inspectorate has had a quiet Halloween night.
The officers were only called twice to eggs thrown by children against the facades of houses.
Since the owners of the house recognized this in time and removed the egg remains at once, no property damage would have occurred.
Furthermore, some New Year's Eve fires were reported in the city area, but no property damage was caused here either.
A resident of Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in toilet paper and his Radzier blinds were stolen.
However, by the time the police arrived, the man had found all his radar sightings in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to take further action.
Housing with a future
Waltraud Ries is a lovely place.
Your house is in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old stand of trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders", Waltraud Ries asks, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, she explains, is not a fear of spiders but a fear of not being able to handle the many steps leading up to the house and into the apartment as one ages.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-50-year-old has had to experience firsthand what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability.
Recently she published a book entitled 'Happy Living to Be Older - What Housing Is Best for Me?'
'Our apartment is the best example of what you can't do when you're old,' she says.
When she and her husband moved into the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of nowhere.
Today, in her mid-50's, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who are actually concerned about the subject of 'living in old age'.
Most people just keep it out as long as they can.
'It's always the others who get old,' she says with a smile.
It's only when the pressure is really great that you start to worry.
'It may be too late by then,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 models of housing for a self-determined living in old age.
'But the type of accommodation you choose is always an individual decision,' she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford to retire in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider the possibility of falling ill.
And 'without a good knowledge of the local language, one can also be united in the 'Dolce Vita,' the author of the reference book advises those who wish to emigrate.
The models include classic care models, alternative forms of housing and the often cited pensioner housing.
In old age , everyone has their ticks and spots .
'I wouldn't be in a rooming-in situation,' she says with a wink.
Not like a dorm room with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
'In old age, you need your own space,' says Ries.
The author does not want to rule out the possibility that a community home for the elderly can still function.
But it's not the same as a traditional student dormitory.
And sometimes you just want to be alone,' she says.
She is not alone in this opinion, at least in the capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible', is also the experience of Theresa R√ºtten, the head of the Citizen Service for the Aged in the State capital.
Their service advises people on the subject of 'growing old'.
This is why older people in particular often accept inconveniences and restrictions just to stay in their usual environment, as is the experience of the Foundation Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make your home accessible.
Ries recommends that anyone who is considering age-appropriate remodeling of their home or apartment should first do some research and not hire the first handyman.
Today, there are specialists in age-appropriate remodeling.
Even in the rented apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it's just the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clarifies.
However, it is not always possible to adapt the existing dwelling to the needs of the elderly and thus to make it accessible, even if it is still beautiful.
Waltraud Ries had to go through this experience.
A stair lift could be installed inside the apartment, but the stairs to the front door would be a much bigger obstacle.
She will keep searching until she finds the perfect object for herself and her husband.
She's more afraid of moving than of the spider at her door.
The US wants to prosecute Snowden
The United States has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.
He is still being charged with unauthorized disclosure of classified information.
He must therefore be brought before the courts in the US, said the US State Department spokeswoman, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
And Snowden's recent comments wouldn't change that.
German Green Party politician Hans-Christian Str√∂bele had earlier appealed to the US after meeting Snowden in Moscow not to threaten him further with punishment.
The European Parliament has also called for the EU to take action to combat the spread of the virus and to ensure that the virus is contained in all its organs.
The whistleblower Edward Snowden is willing to talk to the German authorities.
But first, he wants to know what's going on.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee wanted by the US in an unaddressed letter that the Green politician Hans-Christian Str√∂bele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General.
The letter reads as follows, according to a translation distributed by Str√∂bele:
To the competent authorities
I've been asked to write to you regarding your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden, and I have previously worked under contract or direct employment as a technical expert for the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government, which made me act out of moral obligation.
As a result of publishing these concerns, I was subjected to severe and sustained harassment that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and even high officials - including in the United States - have seen the revelations about a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is accountable to no one as a public service.
These revelations of espionage led to many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society of these findings are becoming increasingly clear, while the risks involved have been significantly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of faith and seeks to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
Still, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this unwelcome attitude.
I hope that, once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to contribute in a responsible manner to the clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, in accordance with the law.
I look forward to speaking to you in your country as soon as the situation is cleared up and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden is testified by Hans-Christian Str√∂bele
The nursery has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands", says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the Gartenstra√üe has been sold by the municipality to a private person.
The sale was approved by the municipal council at its last meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed hands at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied", Maier stresses.
The budget was set at ‚Ç¨100,000.
It's not yet clear what the new owner will do with the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and thus no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking after the garden and clearing the sidewalk.
"That has been a lot of work", Maier says with pleasure.
Square concert in the heat of summer
The Hammereisenbach music club is giving a concert on the terrace of the Hammer Inn.
When the conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clock at 7:30 p.m., the thermometer is still reading 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners delight in the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
Chairman Manuela Honeck will explain the music.
Honeck thanked all those who had helped him to overcome his first musical shock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have been secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable surprise in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 campaign, Double Down: Game Change 2012.
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's top advisers conducted "extensive group meetings and polls in late 2011" to determine whether Obama's waning re-election hopes would be better served by Biden's defeat.
According to Jonathan Martin, the Times' national political correspondent, the book thoroughly traces the history of efforts by leading campaign and White House staffers, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to gauge the effect on poll numbers of swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President.
The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe knew about the proposed change.
In Double Down, it is alleged that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to replace Biden despite their close, personal relationship, before ultimately deciding against such a move after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy would not "significantly improve Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration was actually considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said a whole bunch of things that should be considered, and this was one of them", Daley told the magazine.
You have to remember that the president had terrible polling records at the time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley called the investigations "due care", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that during the re-election campaign, considerable effort was made to determine whether such a move would pay off in the ballot box.
"In campaigns, you don't spend as much money on polls and focus groups unless you're thinking seriously about something", Martin explained on AC360.
It's not clear, however, that Obama knew his team was considering an exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential switch.
Although Daley said he did not believe the president was "aware" of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political soundings reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know about the investigation into whether to drop Biden in the election.
"Maybe", said Martin.
What happens to my email on the road?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was the design of the Internet service e-mail similar to that of the conventional postal service, and did it technically implement the letter of confidentiality?
The first Internet services were designed with the primary focus on enabling communication.
The basic technical protocols have therefore not been designed to provide a stable foundation for a sound exchange of letters.
A conventional e-mail is therefore more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
When user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two connected directly?
The first step is for Anna's email program or browser to send the mail to the mail server of her service provider.
If she has a Gmail account, for example, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the contents to the provider that Benni uses.
On the way, the mail can be run through several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content at his provider.
Are conventional e-mails read on their way through the net?
Most e-mails are read multiple times by software robots on the go.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail contains a malware as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiving systems.
The providers also check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam email that is deleted immediately or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have any other tasks?
In systems such as Gmail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place contextual advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via Gmail about their upcoming holiday, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do people you don't know read your e-mails?
The likelihood of unauthorized persons reading an e-mail is extremely low.
But theoretically, it is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
The law also allows law enforcement agencies and intelligence services to intercept or read e-mails.
And that's not to mention the potential for illegal spying.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from being read?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With great technical effort, it is also possible to obscure the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to identify who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the German e-mail market?
In the case of mostly privately used mailboxes, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role, according to a study by Convios Consulting in August 2013.
While Yahoo Mail's shares were last down, Google's GMail was able to gain significantly.
Mother lost her life in the woods and retirement money
When his aged mother died, a man from Wolfsburg came up with a plan.
He buried her in a forest and continued to collect her pension and child support.
In order to continue to collect his pension and the maintenance allowance, a 67-year-old Wolfsburg resident buried his dead mother in the forest, according to a police investigation.
First he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he's been pocketing the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, a spokesman said Friday.
According to the man, the woman was hidden in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected in May when it became clear that the mother, who needed care, no longer needed medication.
The pensioner told investigators that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officers, they investigated further.
It turned out that the two had lived in the same apartment for more than 15 years and he had last tended to her.
The 67-year-old had admitted his mother's death.
An autopsy revealed no evidence of a capital crime, according to the police.
You want some ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a glowing treat.
He got the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to make the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when eaten, raising the pH in the protein and causing the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and lights up, so the more you lick it, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says, "The product is amazing, but it's in the very early stages of production, and you can get two grams of it for 200 pounds".
The protein used in ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth heats the protein, the pH rises and the ice glows.
We've been testing it for the last few months, and we thought it was ideal to bring it to market on Halloween, because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jellyfish fluorescein is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet cost me about 140 pounds.
But it's delicious.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors, which include beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is destined to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I'd like to develop an invisible ice cream".
That's not possible in itself because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I suspect we'll find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists
TSV Morsum is still without any points in the Handball-Verbandsliga after six days of play.
Now, of all times, Ingo Ehlers' team will face the TSV Daverden in the derby tomorrow, after celebrating its first victory last weekend.
This game is the beginning of the season for us.
"I hope we can finally clear our minds", says Ehlers, optimistically.
He finally has his entire squad at his disposal, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme.
Daverden is also a tempomaniac.
So we have to keep our error rate low.
The first thing to do is to increase the cover, which has so far been far from safe.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after his first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was a house number, of course.
But that doesn't make us the favorite, because anything can happen in the derby.
Panitz is going to Morsum to start a series.
The Commission will be in touch with the European Parliament.
For this, the A-Youth Joost Windussuss, who is active with a double right at the A-Youth Bundesliga club HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
If you're not hot in a game like this, you should stay home.
2013: Halloween in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had a magic to it.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late, and dress up for the neighborhood.
I'm more of a Halloween muffin today.
I have not agreed to give out candy from my apartment for the last two years, and I probably won't this year.
But statistically, I'm the black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million to be exact - will be celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion dollars spent, according to the NRF.
This year, provocative inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothing, they can now also embody seductive food like pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I'm expecting a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk space men are gonna make it to the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year, and to my surprise, they weren't alone.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on pet costumes, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
We're not picky about candy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candy and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people who are walking around the neighborhood saying "sweet or sour", according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and we're not going to pretend to eat it.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the candy corn, yet 15 million pounds of it is sold on Halloween, according to the National Candy Manufacturers Association.
That's about nine billion grains of corn.
It's a riddle I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing is more Halloween than haunted houses.
They have great names like Terror Behind the Walls (which is in a real prison, by the way), Howl-O-Scream and The House of Shock.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that generate 500 million dollars in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those wonderful photos where you pee in your pants and then post them to your friends on Facebook, where you never get rid of them, and then the guy you're standing on leaves you a comment like "nice facial expression".
But let's get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree -- something we've done since we were kids.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin rather than sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkin, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lamp that is slowly rotting in the front yard is believed to be from Illinois, where 500 million pounds of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score real, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 2,000-pound pumpkin.
Rescue workers recover charred body from fire in Helmbrechts
The fire department had to move out of Helmbrechts late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the Hof district catches fire on Friday night.
Rescue workers are retrieving a charred body from the house.
Rescue workers have found a charred body in a three-family house in Helmbrechts.
It is not yet clear whether the man is a resident of the area, a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
Late Thursday night, there was a fire on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire department arrived, the flames were already billowing out of a window.
The emergency services went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned down completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
The other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman explained.
The building is uninhabitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its pastors will be halved by 2030 in the current situation of about 1,800 pastors.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien, 43, in a conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and the daily schedule yourself.
With Burfien, the church has appointed a full-time pastor to encourage young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after high school.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-churching: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The Commission's proposal is to be adopted by the end of the year.
I am the master of my calendar and can put my priorities where they are important to me.
Pastors could be very close to the people as a minister.
They'd make as much as teachers and could live on it.
Certainly, in the free economy, the pay is higher, but in return, theologians have a secure employer.
This is in line with the young people of today, who are not just interested in a career but in a meaningful job.
According to the Landeskirche, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, some 40 graduates of theological studies are beginning their vicarship.
In the future, it may be difficult to fill jobs in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, Emsland or Wendland.
Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology studies offer a broad education.
You can even become president of the federal government.

They are not all experienced racing drivers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure and for an accessible path to world-class events.
We are delighted to be opening this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format will open up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers to the challenges and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge cars  this is going to be a fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will feature a training and testing day in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters called to rescue a puppy trapped in a quarry on a dangerous ledge 50 feet [15 m] above the ground
Cockerspaniel dog Ruby had run away after a minor car accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a passerby in the quarry in her plight.
Firefighters ran to the rock wall and saved the dog from certain death
Firefighters were able to rescue a puppy that was stuck in a 50-foot-high ledge.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away from a car accident on Sunday afternoon and survived alone for three days before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, who own the dog, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to welcome Ruby back and to thank the firefighters from the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had been desperately searching for their missing dog and posting calls for help on social media after she ran off into the quarry after the small traffic accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a man walking his dog saw Ruby stranded on the 50-foot-high ledge in the quarry.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station's technical rescue team rushed to the scene and raced down to rescue Ruby, who was then transported up in a dog crate.
Andy Clayton, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall, about 50 feet (15 m) above the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her rescue. She was frozen solid.
But she's fine now.
She ate some dog cakes afterwards.
That was a rather unusual deployment.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge accident".
There was a chance that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for examination, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: 'Watching the rescue was frightening.'
I couldn't believe she was actually up there.
It was wonderful to hold her again.
The vet said that if the exhaustion had been too much and she had collapsed, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters did a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We're just so grateful and each and every one of you has been absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: We were afraid it would fall down, but it stayed up.
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she's been.
Mick Jagger says he never made out with Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she had been a backing singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Explained that she had dinner with the old man, Perry, and that he had a crush on me when I was 18.
She added: "It was a long time ago, and he was very nice to me".
In a statement, a representative for Jagger, 70, said Thursday that he "categorically denies that he ever made any advances toward Katy Perry".
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else".
Perry was one of the singers who guested on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism just landed at number one this week.
George Kerevan: European unity gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another horror story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
That provides the key to stories about passport controls at Berwick and a barbed-wire border along Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde Template pointed to the potential economic benefits that more freedom of movement in the rest of Europe would bring, but this played no role in the headlines, as expected.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more convenient for them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued disregard for Brussels would be a small concession in return for what is really wanted from the Scots.
So, not really a story.
And one that has come so far in the years that it is already like a fossil: the first time I heard the "independence means passport controls" duck at least 40 years ago.
But the point of interest is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance to the tune of Europe?
Why trade the London yoke for the Brussels one, especially now?
The real news in Europe is that the great post-war plan to unite Europe has been foiled.
The euro crisis has officially ended the European project.
Across the EU, parties hostile to the EU or seeking to discard the euro as the common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, which was founded this year, was able to win almost five million votes in the September Bundestag elections, effectively ousting the Free Democrats (the British equivalent of the Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, is proving to be a turning point.
The strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket imposed on the national economy by the common currency, has led many to believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits  this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pegged its members to exchange rates that are favourable to German exporters  and German politicians would like to keep this up.
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-√†-vis Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending  spurred on by Berlin.
The current budgetary and monetary problems are underpinned by a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the 'Green Energy Directives' enacted by Brussels, and a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers, European industry is paying twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage fixing in the world does not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into a corner by cheap American shale gas.
The result is a revolt, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and put Paris on a par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, which the battered French economy has to contend with.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election, pushing the ruling Socialists into third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes - a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right-wing spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among working-class white Frenchmen?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections - and this is very likely - then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I am trying to make: in the not too distant future, growing resentment of the EU and the single currency will converge on the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the 'Europe of (sovereign) nations' favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can choose to be a region of (ultimately) Little England.
The European Parliament has a duty to ensure that the European Parliament is not the only one to be able to give its opinion on the matter.
I suspect that Scotland could do quite well in a looser European Union, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and retaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is  remarkably  the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe, and in 2011 won a spectacular majority by rejecting the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour finance minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition were responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide to become independent now, only to have a policy of austerity imposed on it by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not necessarily mean puberty
There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic is a trigger for early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter is growing breasts and pubic hair by the age of seven or eight?
Speaking at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and represent a new norm.
'I spend a lot of time trying to reassure my parents. 'This is not usually a sign that puberty is coming fast,' explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious developmental signs, such as enlarged breasts, pubic and underarm hair, and body odor, are more noticeable in girls.
However, there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the onset of the first menstrual period) over the past 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 years in 1970.
"Once the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years before menopause", said Kaplowitz, who also authored the book "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing With This Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
There is some debate about what actually marks the beginning of puberty, but it is considered "premature" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates, something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
If the procedure is carried out more quickly, tests by an endocrinologist may be indicated to rule out serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and to prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can ultimately lead to stunted growth and thus to little growth in adults.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, developmental speed, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant about medication, but he admits: "Suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls' feelings of being different from their peers".
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have their periods.
'They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side,' said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock", recalls a woman whose daughter had her period at age 10.
Even though there were early signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home from school scared and excited because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
Yet, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys and girls reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz believes the most compelling premise is the obesity epidemic.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which established a link between body fat and the onset of puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are various explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genetics.
Another mystery: Although boys grow facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend toward full puberty earlier is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even among babies and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty", said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected", advised Kaplowitz.
If you remain calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the reassurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than expected.
Jumbo manufacturers fight over seat width in the face of large orders
A dispute has erupted between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of seats in the economy class of long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The controversy revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long-haul flights in economy class - not always the one that airlines strive for the most, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims made in the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in tourist class, but US archrival Boeing says that should be up to airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are vying to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul planes, and expect record orders at the event from November 17 to 21.
The design of the rear of the aircraft, particularly whether there are rows of nine or ten seats, is decisive for the stated economic results that the new 'Mini-Jumbo' design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims that its upgraded 777X can seat 406 people in economy class seats that are over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the economy class, with nine in each row.
The airline giants often advertise technical details in the trade press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X, with over 100 orders expected to make the race, is being shown.
Recently, the company launched an ad that could be the start of a new advertising war, showing backers a picture of three people huddled together in a restaurant, with the headline, "Would you accept this?"
'Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo props,' says Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
People are getting fatter in the face of changing dietary habits, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970's, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, the average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 has gained 10 percent more weight, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The average 21st century American male is 5 feet 4 inches (10.8 cm) tall, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat design from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly-baptized 'Jet Set' was narrower.
Research has shown that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus's seat numbers and says it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance between fares and amenities.
The company also explains that studies have shown that the experience of flying depends on more than the width of the seat.
'What it really comes down to is giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to do to be successful,' explains Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone.
For air passengers, it is about more freedom, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming an issue that can affect sales.
The dispute is a race for aircraft orders worth an estimated $700 billion at list prices over the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the United States or Europe.
As first reported by Reuters in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the controversy over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements about the results depend in part on comparing the 777X with its ten seats per row to the original nine-seat design in the 777.
The increased unit costs are still lower than for the current machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing is therefore cramming more seats into its aircraft to make them more competitive with our products", says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row on existing 777s suggested that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement, which could come with cheaper fares.
"Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that, from an economic standpoint, the Airbus supply is driven by the threat of the 777", says Mary Kirby, cabin-fitting expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
The Commission has not received any comments from the French authorities on the compatibility of the aid.
The jet sellers traveling the world even carry tape measure to check the equipment against the competition.
Even if they boast of comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density designs for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a ten-seat A350 but says it has not yet sold any.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability in cabins, offering wide aisle seats for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the call for a new industry standard will likely be dampened, but could distract from the surge in 777X sales.
New nicotine vaccine could end the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could ruin the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
More trials are needed before human testing, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can one day help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and tried all the methods available on the market, but have found that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches", says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been altered to contain the genetic information to produce nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, thus preventing a smoker from experiencing a nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice given nicotine maintained their normal activity levels.
Unvaccinated mice, on the other hand, took a "time out", the researchers explained, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower, for it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if it is absolutely certain, could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely, smokers would use it to quit.
"They know that when they start smoking again, they don't feel like it because of the nicotine poison, and that helps them to quit", he says.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labor minister Joe Tripodi of New South Wales is being investigated by the state's corruption watchdog.
The former NSW Minister denies changing the maritime lease regulations at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden holdings in three parcels of land on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Obeid influenced various ministers to renew leases on Circular Quay, where the Obeids ran two restaurants and a cafe, without a tender after they expired in August 2005.
Now, the investigation is being conducted into the allegation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's covert interest in the properties, after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, testified to that effect on Thursday.
In years of talks, starting in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the leases for the companies on Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were extended without a public tender.
The Commission considers that the aid granted to the Ports of Sardinia and the Ports of Trento constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
But he denied making the changes at the request of Obeid, who, Tripodi confirmed, had been pushing for a reshuffle of the government's squat regulations.
A telephone transcript provided to ICAC showed conversations between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had transferred to the Port Authority after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority, in August and September 2007.
'Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial leasing arrangements?' asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No", said Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't that.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli warplanes are striking targets in Syria, according to official sources.
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said it was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was a Russian SA-125 missile.
Israel has already carried out airstrikes on missile shipments in Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers on 457 visas could be subjected to 'authenticity tests'
The government is considering extended measures to introduce a 'authenticity test' for foreign workers with a 457 visa.
If the test is introduced, it would be based on a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to come to Australia.
A government discussion proposal was released today after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's comments on foreign workers as offensive to Australia's neighbours.
"Loud statements like 'foreigners should line up at the back' and 'Australians should hire first' are a very uncomfortable throwback to times when unions have been calling for a protected labour market", she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white labor was to be protected, and if some in the region would hear an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The debate proposal covers 12 measures that were once considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human trafficking, has implemented five of the changes recommended, with the others still under consideration.
If the 'authenticity criterion' is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be checked for the authenticity of the application in cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting enterprise.
Companies could also be required to report on the number of 457 visa holders, after companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers ended up hiring hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of what appears to be a heart attack after arriving on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's disturbed nine-year-old son, who had come with him to Australia, has been cared for since his father's death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to have high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England as early as 2026 at the start of Phase 1.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring the UK closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was delighted to be working with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
Once phase two is completed, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high speed road between London and the north of England from ¬£32.7 billion to ¬£42.6 billion.
The UK Government, in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for the North of England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a journey time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: 'Our aim for HS2 is a truly national rail network, bringing Britain and its towns closer together.'
We're moving forward with HS2 because it has tremendous benefits.
Without it, we face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: 'Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.'
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "unambiguously" advocate for the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Brown said: 'The high-speed rail link has the potential to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but at the same time Scotland's economic strength is also an argument for high-speed rail links across the UK.'
That is why we are pleased to be working as a partner of the UK Government and exploring the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that will bring benefits to all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to discussing the inquiry report with the British ministers next year and to deciding together what to do next.
Australia's electronic equipment regulations remain in force provisionally
Australian air passengers continue to be required to turn off their tablets and smartphones on take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax regulations on such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their regulations so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases, as long as they are in "flight mode".
For most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do this, but many people are annoyed that they are not allowed to read their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian companies are watching the decision, which will require a lot of work from US airlines, but have no immediate plans to change their regulations.
CASA also said it would look into the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight in Australia remained in place.
CASA currently has no specific regulations on the use of electronic devices on board aircraft, it was said.
The subject is subject to regulations requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and requiring passengers to follow safety instructions given by cabin staff.
Virgin has already been in talks with CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, and said it was open to change, but that it would have to be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, as we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience, as we now offer (wireless entertainment) in flight", a spokesperson said.
Qantas has stated that it will continue to follow the current regulations until further notice.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices are not allowed to be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no plans to change that at this time", the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision affects US companies differently depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate the malfunctions caused by mobile devices and modify manuals, training materials, hand luggage programmes and customer instruction.
"Once an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter-weight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any altitude", the FAA announced.
In rare cases, with poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under the seat or in the overhead compartments during takeoff and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, BVB fans who had travelled with them had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins-Arena with flares.
Borussia Dortmund then announced that there would be severe consequences.
Before Friday's Bundesliga match against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with silence - at first.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustics, which offered the viewer until just before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
Mostly the guest fans and their songs.
The southern stands, on the other hand, where the most loyal and loudest BVB fans are, were unusually quiet at first: no songs, no battle cries.
The podium of the capo, who normally coordinates the joint cheering, remained unoccupied.
And at the front of the stands, a large banner with the words "Stadium Prohibited Section" was waving alone.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always the first BVB player, entered the field, did short-term cheerleading begin.
As his teammates followed, there was loud singing and blowing scarves - but not everywhere.
There was no activity in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Stand.
Norbert Dickel, the stadium's announcer, once again recounted the positive experiences of the last few days - the victory in the derby, the victory over Arsenal, the extension of the contract of coach J√ºrgen Klopp - but this did not create a festive mood.
Five minutes before the start of the game, the capo climbed his podium, and the tension that had been palpable until then was released in a loud scream as Dickel, as usual, checked the mood on the stadium's stands.
The South Stand was the last to be built, and it was the loudest place in the stadium.
And when the loud call "Winner of the derby stands up" came at the latest with the whistle from the southern stand, everything was back to normal.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB fans who had travelled with them had fired flares into the spectators and onto the pitch - and almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the whole ultra movement", the BVB boss announced on Thursday night at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras from a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I have forbidden that", he explained.
We cannot abandon our zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
The Ultras have also been given various options for punishment, and until Tuesday they have time to decide on one.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be given the task of drawing up a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos.
"This is going to be cutting edge", Watzke assured.
It is interesting to see how the southern tribune will react.
Mortgage companies boom in Singapore as the crisis hits the middle class
In a pawn shop in Singapore's Bendemeer Mall, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay for her daughters' school fees.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, and I have put all my money in it", says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 (US$1,500) a month as an administrative assistant and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - is so high that ValueMax, where it made its swap, became the third pawnbroker to be listed on the Singapore Exchange this week.
Securing jewelry is not only a quick way to get money  1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga , but it's also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Singaporean mortgages charge an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent that United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall, charges.
However, pawnshops offer the advantage that no credit check or proof of income is required, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit because of loose fiscal policies in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are looking to mortgage companies to make up the difference in a faltering economy.
This week, Standard & Poor's ratings agency called rising household debt, mainly from rising mortgages, a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
The Agency estimates that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt to GDP ratio in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week barely emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (of the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible", says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have further fueled the trend of selling off personal items as people take the opportunity to convert family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city-state's 200 pawn shops are gold.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's pawn Grandma's gold necklace and bring it back next month".
Thailand's largest pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in customers at its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pawn business is so strong that ValueMax, which operates the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, is looking to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia - where the company operates four properties - but also outside Asia, said ValueMax's chief executive, Yeah Lee Ching.
The company is financing this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it raised this week with its Singapore IPO.
While some lenders have been caught in the crossfire over high interest rates, Yeah explains that not only did pawn shops charge lower interest rates than other lenders, they also did not directly increase the debt.
'Customers borrow items they already own, and the liquidation of personal valuables does not increase the budget deficit', she explains.
The mortgage business is increasingly accepted by society as a short-term, secured financing.
Nor are all mortgage borrowers in financial difficulty.
Wealthy Singaporeans also come to ValueMax stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
We have clients from all walks of life.
These include wealthy people borrowing for a short-term business or investment, or small businesses that need to bridge cash-flow bottlenecks, says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA is sucking data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden has a vested interest in helping Germany solve the ever-growing NSA spy affair.
According to Hans-Christian Str√∂bele, a member of the Greens in the Bundestag, his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-intelligence officer would testify to a German public prosecutor or before an investigation committee.
Snowden had referred to his complicated legal situation, Str√∂bele told ARD magazine "Panorama".
Australian government to provide $325 million in healthcare
The Australian government is insisting on the tough terms associated with the Australian $325 million healthcare bailout to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate action" to avert a crisis caused by the island nation's aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and systemic limitations.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultation with the independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state", Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency relief for election benefits.
A further 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic procedures and treatments for cataracts, are to be carried out to remove residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved after-hospital care, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of an electronic health record system in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that clinical staff have told me are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system", said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict accountability of the Tasmanian Government.
The state must maintain current funding levels to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the extra money has been spent.
A three-person commission is being established to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use unless "it is accompanied by real reforms that put the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable course".
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that the federal grants will make a big contribution to taking the state's public health system off the worry list", Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these electoral benefits will largely compensate for the recent cuts.
But the opposition's health policy spokesman at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes today's announcement is just a "patch" solution.
"We are in this situation today because the Labor state government has taken $430 million out of the health system", he told ABC TV.
It's not like a state government can take almost half a billion dollars out of the system and put 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretend that's good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout money would be spent on extra bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot is convincing with its exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but it is also more difficult than necessary.
Set in 1760s France, the film tells the poignant story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips into lust or sensationalism and that's its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it a torturous penitential for the audience as well.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production facility, says a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed key chemical weapons and poison gas munitions production facilities, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group said on Thursday, as heavy clashes erupted in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the civil war began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the deadline on
The Commission has also taken note of the fact that the Council has not yet adopted a decision on the application of the principle of proportionality.
The completion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timeline aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
But Damascus still has to start destroying its weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as clashes erupted in the town of Safira on Thursday, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility and warehouses, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them were from President Bashar Assad's army, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militia.
Also among the dead were 2,202 army deserters and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the death toll in the conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This figure has not been updated.
The conflict has forced some two million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but gave no details.
The fighting underscores the danger facing chemical weapons inspectors, whose mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal is a race against time amid a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is now convinced that it has seen and witnessed the destruction of all the major production and mixing/filling facilities identified by Syria.
Therefore, no further inspection activities are currently planned.
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of 23 sites identified by Damascus.
Inspectors said that two facilities were not visited because of safety concerns.
On Thursday, the OPWC said the two sites had been "abandoned" according to Syrian statements ... and that the chemical weapons program objects there had been moved to other designated facilities that had been inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the site at Safira was one of the two facilities that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will have to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I salute the bravery and courage you all have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization", said Ahmed Uzumcu, the director general of the monitoring organization, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting a civil war against the Assad government and its security forces, many of whom are Alawites, a sect of Shiite Islam.
As for further developments, the head of the monitoring group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion at an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Anger over verdict for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict for the last of the instigators to be brought to trial, as they believe that Umar Patek should be shot in the face.
Patek, who spent nearly a decade as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted fugitives, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
If he's given a suspended sentence, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many more.
A guilty verdict was also reached in a number of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had asked for a life sentence, although it could have asked for the death penalty for the man, who is also known as "Demolition Man" because of his reputation as a master bomb maker.
The decision has triggered painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation wrought by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly a decade ago.
She said, fighting tears, that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I mean, he should really follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"He should be put on a firing squad", Corteen told AAP.
I have to live with the fact that I'm not going to have any more grandchildren and I'm never going to see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when a massive bomb exploded in a pickup truck parked outside the club shortly after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had detonated a backpack full of explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times while on life support.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah  Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra  terror cell responsible for the bloodbath who were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty more than anyone else.
No, there's no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He evaded capture for nearly a decade, but was finally apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden just under four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden with the aim of re-establishing the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't turn himself in", said Corteen.
Until recently, he showed no remorse for the pain he caused others.
The verdict came ahead of the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, which is being commemorated in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year", said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal his conviction.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but not cell phone calls)
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, listen to music and watch movies from takeoff to landing, but not to use their cell phones, according to new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented would depend on the airline, FAA official Michael Huerta told a news conference.
Air carriers must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and equipment fitting regulations to comply with the new regulations.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon", the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices when the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They can't be launched until the plane has reached an altitude of two miles and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the approach area, passengers must turn them off and must not restart them until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines that have electronically jammed aircraft could allow their passengers to use the devices during takeoff, landing and on the tarmac, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft retrofitted for use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Association, welcomed the changes.
If the new regulation is implemented safely and we are working closely with the airline on this , both sides will benefit from it, commented Glading.
We are frankly sorry to have to feel like we are the caretaker on this matter.
However, internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data within three kilometres remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was publicly forced to leave an American Airlines jet because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the tarmac.
And heavier devices like laptops must still be stowed away, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
The Commission has also proposed a number of amendments to the directive.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has the authority to regulate telephone calls, not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, the safety expert for national traffic issues, told CBS News that cell phones are still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that airborne transmission can also interfere with broadcast masts", Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee, set up by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow for a broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, there has been increased pressure on the FAA to ease restrictions on its use.
Critics, such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, argue that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become pervasive.
Some studies have shown that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the switch.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travelers in 1966 after reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment by passenger-carried FM radios, then the latest technology.
New aircraft are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and FAA-approved to be immune to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi when they reach altitude for several years.
Airplanes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less susceptible to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic equipment under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, give off only minimal radiation when you flip through a page.
But when you download or send data, the transfer values are stronger.
Among those advocating a relaxation of restrictions on passenger device use is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and took a test flight to determine any problems, but failed to detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risks of using the devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed the interference from the devices was real, even though the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only isolated reports of pilots claiming that the devices were interfering with aircraft systems, and most of these were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the devices during instrument landings in poor visibility.
One travel industry grouping welcomed the changes, calling them a sensible adjustment for travelers who would be highly equipped with technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety", said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Air rescue service releases bird rescued from North Sea oil rig
A bird flown ashore by air rescue service, found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, has been released back into the wild.
The water horse was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was picked up by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA at their rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, the centre's director, said: 'This water eagle was probably a winter migrant from northern Europe, which was blocked by strong winds over the North Sea.'
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill island.
He added: 'He was unable to fly any further, so we were contacted to ask for help.'
When the water was released, the water was healthy and fit.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the business community together and defining what those who create wealth and jobs in Britain would like to see changed in our relationship with the EU.
To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders, representing approximately the size, sector and region of the UK's businesses.
The results of the poll will surprise many.
We found that the vast majority of companies now export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing, while the EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to promote new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than delay the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's obscure institutions.
When asked for their views on certain regulatory issues  ranging from antitrust law to product legislation , the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, as businesses said the costs of Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area - even 40 per cent of large companies agreed with the one that is traditionally the most pro-European.
Finally, and perhaps most telling, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wanted the UK to take a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade, not politics.
This finding, which is shared by companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pressing for a 'meaningful change' that will bring the pinch of trading back to the UK.
It's a lot of work  changing the agreement and better terms for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum at 16 per cent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate the UK's terms of EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation to bring a significant shift of power back to the UK.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey results show, which means a greater focus on trade for businesses and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom board of directors said.
Today's event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun, said Alexei Miller, Gazprom's CEO, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to provide more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its competitors in Ukraine, where the bulk of Russian gas for Europe is stored, is putting conventional routes at increased risk, officials say.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were 'forever' removed.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at preferential rates when the entire project is put into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other downstream countries on the planned route is to begin by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way to bypass Germany as a location for real estate.
The economic data are correct and the financing possibilities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the Stock Exchange newspaper.
The German property markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
This was pointed out by Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Jones Lang LaSalle for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, on the 9th day of the real estate market.
The volume of transactions shows how much German commercial property is sought after, Ulbrich said.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared with the previous year's average.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Real estate investment offers an attractive return", said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Royal Commission hearing: Two YMCA staff members charged with sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with child-related sexual offences before allegations were made against Caringbah carer Jonathan Lord in 2011, the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse has learned.
However, in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA had stated that it had 'never been involved in an incident of child sexual abuse within the organisation'.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences and another in which a YMCA Caringbah Hall sports teacher had been convicted in 1991 of abusing children in his care.
Gail Hare, one of the lawyers assisting the Commission, told Furness that he knew about the first case but not about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that there had been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as being at the forefront of child safety.
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it had been rated second lowest of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of that year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at 21, admitted that the management had "failed me from the top down" in hiring Lord and not ensuring that staff were clear about their obligations to report violations of child safety guidelines.
Lord had been convicted earlier this year of sexually abusing 12 boys during his two-year stint with the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting Lord's violations of child safety.
Staff testified they observed violations, including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, having them sit on his lap, telling one person he loved them, and letting children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was a Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that the child services manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the supervising Lord at the YMCA Caringbah, was "intimidating to look at and very distant most of the time".
The manager stated that he would not accept statements by employees that they had not dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with the Lord had impaired their judgment, which is why they had not reported him.
Mr Hare stated that he had informed the NSW YMCA board of his view that the lesson the organisation should draw from the Jonathan Lord incident was not related to reporting by staff and the board had agreed.
Hare said the decision to force staff to sign non-disclosure agreements shortly after the allegations were made was made by the YMCA's Children's Services Director, Liam Whitley.
He said that this was to prevent contamination of evidence, but that it had been 'over-deliberate' and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, told the Commission.
He explained that there had been 'serious problems' in recruiting, screening, training, training and supervising staff.
The hearing has been adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the chance to return as British Prime Minister  but admits a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments have mostly been limited to foreign policy and his role as an envoy for the Quartet of Middle East Peace-Making Leaders.
Asked if he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted by London's Evening Standard as saying: "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely that's going to happen, so ... "
When the show horse experts gathered in droves in Cardiff to select the horse of the year, they knew that a fierce competition was ahead.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland pony Toffee raced through the three rounds and took first prize, leaving 30 adult competitors behind.
The inseparable pair, both of equal height, have been praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition, hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had set his plate cap at a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural skills in handling the pony, which were well above his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for his performance and his personality.
Fenton had been given Toffee as a present for his third birthday last March and had been practicing every day with the Shetland pony since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee make a great team".
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and walked off the field with a gold cup and a rosette.
It was only the second time he'd entered a Toffee contest, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely unknown people in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was electrified, and everyone cheered and clapped".
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena, and even though he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to look after.
The way he's started, it won't be long before he's on the "Horse of the Year Show" and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony".
They make a great team.
The judges rated Fenton and Toffee based on how well they had fought and performed in the ring.
They're looking for a good relationship between Pony and Fuhrer, and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes did their part, which really fitted the occasion perfectly.
Chinese newspaper calls for 'reform'
A Chinese newspaper that had a front page demanding the release of a reporter accused of defamation should be reformed, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou-based Neue Express had printed a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes to falsify reports about a state-owned company.
The new express train is now undergoing a 'comprehensive re-engineering', the regulator said.
The 'Retesting Order' was issued by the Guangdong Press, Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the Neue Express, owned by the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly, the regulator said in a statement.
She said it was decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to revoke his reporter's license.
It also instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a complete rectifying of the New Express and recommended that the relevant officials of the New Express be identified and the New Express management team be reviewed without delay
Chen had written several articles for the Neuen Express, reporting on alleged financial irregularities at a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, the newspaper published two calls for his release on its front page, and stood up for his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for a fee.
In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain the trust of the public, he told state-run news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was after money and fame.
I realized that I had acted wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the Neue Express published an apology on its front page, stating that it had failed to properly verify the reports.
Various well-known suspects have recently made televised confessions.
Experts say that coerced confessions are still routine, despite a law change earlier this year that banned authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Drug Tunnel with its own railway discovered between the United States and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated drug tunnels between the United States and Mexico, complete with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operation, has now been discovered.
U.S. authorities described the tunnel, measuring four feet by three feet [120 x 90 cm], as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over a distance of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
There are a number of low-profile warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized, the authorities said.
The tunnel was discovered with eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who were drivers, according to authorities, were charged with possession and intent to sell marijuana and cocaine.
If convicted, you face a prison sentence of ten years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which is challenging drug cartels to get their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 2,000-foot-long railway tunnel that ran from a kitchen in a Tijuana apartment building to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr are still in love
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr have decided to go their separate ways.
But in an interview, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken out about his divorce from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, scheduled to air on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope".
Kerr and he were still in love, the 36-year-old insisted.
"We're gonna support each other and love each other as Flynn's parents".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
Veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism, according to Lexicon, but it differs from it in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians may indulge in cream cake, ice cream, or a strong edamer, these gourmet treats are not on the menu of a vegan.
Vegetarianism is based on the principle of the exclusion of all animal products, including milk, cheese, eggs, and honey.
What remains, one may wonder, but on closer inspection, the vegan food world is marked by considerable ingenuity.
"Bread strips are very popular", explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform home, which has a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
For 13 years, the New Zealander has been a vegan, and in Lampertheim he has found (almost) everything he needs for life. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
Then around the turn of the century, the next step came, and I became a vegan.
"The decision was not just about the diet, but about the shoe", says Proctor, who prefers leather to leather.
I realized that I could do other things in my daily life without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethic.
"I don't want animals to die for me", says Proctor, the vegan maxim that extends to all consumer behaviour.
Instead of mourning the loss of burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears, the vegan quickly discovered brand new products, and enthusiasm grew.
"It's a double bonus", says Proctor today, "that being vegan is not a renunciation, not an asceticism, it's an enrichment". The idea that dietary changes reduce food choices is more a case of the power of habit.
And it was precisely this conditioning that made even some well-intentioned attempts fail.
"The addiction factor is a very important factor that causes many to quit quickly, similar to smoking", Proctor compares.
And he says, "Some tastes are not to be attached to the animal".
Often it is the seasoning or the method of preparation that determines the flavor.
"But there are other ways to achieve the same effect", the vegan explains.
For example, at a barbecue party, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms, and even some vegan sausages.
He is careful to eat a balanced, varied diet, which should be tasty.
Of course you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but that's not just to reduce to animal food", says Proctor.
He was not suffering any ill effects, including an eating disorder, another widely held belief.
For me, the change was a positive one.
I don't take in any foreign cholesterol and I have a high vitamin intake.
There are athletes who are vegan.
"My blood counts are fine, I get checked often", says Proctor.
Many vegan critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12 in particular.
"Because animals are fed feed instead of grazing on pasture, it is questionable whether meat bought from the freezer is high in vitamin B12", says Proctor.
Vegans can also take the coenzyme in tablet form.
"My B12 levels are fine", he explains.
Proctor doesn't have to go far to get food.
After all, basic foodstuffs are everywhere, and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I can find everything I need on the spot.
I buy something special every once in a while.
"Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive, but this is also known to be the case for 'ordinary' finished products".
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the following areas:
"There is a lot to discover in the home kitchen, and with a few small tweaks you can get good, if not sometimes better results", says Proctor.
With margarine instead of butter, a little more baking soda, and carbonic acid instead of eggs, Proctor's vegan cheesecake was able to impress his in-laws.
Family feasts give vegans a new flavor.
It's got dynamics, when you cook together, it has a new value.
"The situations that can arise are as diverse as the people themselves", says Proctor.
Of course, he was also met with scepticism.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I'm drinking milk?" - these are questions that a vegan has to act on with the utmost sensitivity.
"I'm not rejecting people, I'm part of this society", Proctor doesn't want to be an enclave.
And if we look more closely, the everyday world does not seem so vegan-alien as we might think - and the vegan is not so restricted in everyday life as is commonly assumed.
Fast food is allowed.
There's fries everywhere!
"Many doner shops offer falafel or vegetarian yufka", says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he will switch to pasta dishes, or order a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
Restaurants are getting used to it.
"When I started going vegan 13 years ago, it was much more difficult", says the New Zealander, who can identify a trend: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it".
"If enough people come, they may be inclined to supplement the menu", he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the Komb√ºse in Mannheim or the Caf√© Vogelfrei.
Proctor hopes that other restaurants will have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan meals are for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they're the exact opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others", Proctor observes.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a sure way to make the biggest part of it impossible in the first place", says Proctor.
But buying vegan products can be a little difficult at first.
In particular, when one learns that animal additives can also be used as colourants in peanuts, one quickly loses hope in the ethical pursuit in the face of so many obstacles and pitfalls.
Not only that, but Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book called "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives" that explains the many ingredients used in food and cleaning products.
"You gradually develop a scanner vision and know which signs and logos to look out for. Sometimes it's better to take small steps than to stand still or stumble", says Proctor.
Veganism is a very important moral finger pointing at consciousness.
It may not be able to get you to completely abandon your habits, but it can at least teach consumers to critically question their habits.
The Nasdaq OMX stock exchange operator continues to keep its customers in the lurch.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon, German time.
In a communication, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other 11 US options exchanges, including two on the Nasdaq OMX, continued to trade unimpeded.
The recent incident continues a series of smaller and larger failures at the exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the Nasdaq indices had not been calculated for an hour because of data transport errors.
In August of this year alone, there had been two failures in one week.
First, because of technical problems, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs sent a mass of erroneous purchase orders to the options markets.
It took the stock exchange operators almost a whole day to review and cancel the orders.
Two days later, half of all U.S. stock trading was halted for several hours by a computer malfunction at the Nasdaq exchange.
Facebook's IPO last year also caused a stir.
Nasdaq Systems had failed to keep up with the flood of buy and sell orders, the SEC later found and fined the company a record $10 million.
Konstanz: 63-year-old cyclist is run over by cyclists
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was on a women's bicycle on the left sidewalk from the station square towards the marketplace.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped off the sidewalk from a restaurant, the cyclist was unable to stop in time, police said.
The pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house during the ensuing collision, and later fell to the ground, leaving a six-inch-long [15 cm] head wound.
A rescue team took the injured man to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police issue extradition warrant for Assange
British police today handed over an extradition warrant to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has sought refuge and asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old Australian had been issued a "request for information" which required him to appear at a police station, adding that he was threatened with arrest if he did not comply.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on a charge of a sex crime, after his options under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
On 19 June, fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard had issued a summons to a 40-year-old man to appear at a police station at a time of our choosing, a spokesman said.
He's still in violation of the terms of his bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police summons.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged with possible espionage after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic cables on the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks.
Driver who ran at 130 miles an hour with a hot drink between his legs will be fined ¬£1,000
A driver was fined ¬£1,000 for driving at up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on the A120 near Braintree on May 27 in his Mercedes-Benz.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
In Colchester County Court, Mr Howie pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention.
He got seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs of ¬£90 and a victim surcharge of ¬£100.
The tax on foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Treasury has provisionally worked out the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget imposed a 7% stamp duty on homes costing over ¬£2 million, as well as annual fees for buyers who hold homes as a company rather than as individuals.
Already, the revenue from the stamp duty on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea counties, which in the tax year 2012/13 was ¬£708 million, exceeds the revenue for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: 'After the increase in the stamp duty on high-priced housing and the introduction of related legislation to prevent circumvention, it is difficult to argue that high-priced properties are too low-priced, regardless of the effects of the outdated municipal tax system.'
But this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy property in London, or discourage owners from selling, he added.
Premium properties - the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price - in London's affluent southwest belt, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8 percent last year.
Prices in Central London grew steadily at 5.6% per annum, but were overshadowed by a burgeoning 'domestic market' where the southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city were on the upside, according to a Savills study.
Scientists have shed more light on the relationship between a dog's tail wagging and his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs wag their tails to the left.
But now scientists say that other dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "It is well known that the left and right hemispheres of the brain respond differently to stimuli that produce positive or negative emotions in humans.
Here we tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right brain is responsible for the left brain's movement and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail wagging of their fellow species, the researchers monitored the animals while they watched these videos of other dogs.
They measured the four-legged heart rate and analyzed the behavior.
We'll probably soon understand why the tail moves in one direction and the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs movies with dogs, either a true-to-life version or a silhouette to eliminate other distracting aspects, and we could control the tail movement more to the left or right".
When the animals saw an otherwise inexpressive dog move its tail to the right (from the perspective of the wagging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the dizziness was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog howling), their heart rate rose and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara believes that the dogs do not communicate with each other by these movements.
He is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience which movements to be concerned about and which ones not to be.
He said, "If you have multiple encounters with other dogs, and wagging your tail in one direction is more likely to be associated with friendly behavior, and the right side is more likely to produce less friendly behavior, then you respond based on that experience".
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers to better understand their pet's emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behaviour and visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right are important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog, and to the right when they see a happy dog.
Another study at the University of Victoria in Canada found that Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog when its tails are tilted left rather than right rather than becoming restless exactly the opposite of the Italian study.
He said the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in the different studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
'Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details have yet to be determined and dogs are no exception,' says Bradshaw.
But since its behavior is easily recorded, it probably won't be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponing Glasgow gig because of Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys have postponed a show in Glasgow after their lead singer contracted strep throat.
The Sheffield band was supposed to play at the Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert has to be postponed.
The band's announcement came after they had previously postponed a show at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1".
Alex Turner has been diagnosed with a sore throat, so unfortunately he can't perform.
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November, with the show at the Hydro in Glasgow being moved to 21 November.
All tickets reserved for these shows are valid.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconvenience this has caused.
Please contact the customer service at the ticketing offices where you purchased your ticket if you need further assistance.
Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest ranking clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so Francis will be appointing the first group of men who will ultimately be involved in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election - this is the case for a group of 120 cardinals entitled to vote.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony, also known as the consistory, to name the new cardinals.
Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the consistory in February in advance so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from around the world can be scheduled, said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals is likely to have dropped by February.
He explained that a pope would normally appoint as many cardinals as needed to bring the number of cardinals eligible back to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wished.
The European Union is also calling for the establishment of a European Union-wide network of national authorities to monitor the implementation of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the future of the Community.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance", he said.
Forty percent of the Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be named since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who are charged with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the pope made all the decisions.
Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him, said Valero.
He said it was "very possible" that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.
But we haven't been in this position before. This is all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would be appointed to the cardinalate, but Francis is "full of surprises" so we don't know who he's appointing.
GM is recalling new pickup trucks in the U.S. for seat-back repairs.
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to address a problem with the manual seat-back, the U.S. vehicle safety regulator said Friday.
In some vehicles there may be a defect in the mechanism for the reposition of the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal guidelines for vehicle safety for head restraints.
"When the vehicle is approached from behind, the head restraint may not protect the occupants properly, increasing the risk of injury", reads the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch by the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which negatively impacted October auto sales.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, rose 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks, which is a record.
GM's stock was up 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The desperate cry of an Obama voter
I voted for President Obama twice, hoping that change was possible.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been foiled by the Republican blockade tactics.
The blocking policy doesn't excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what could have been.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a very sad book.
It's a book I thought would lift me up during my grim second year of medical school and give me hope again.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient notes and go to bed at night, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take the breath out of a speech.
The election was a landslide victory and news announcers paused to highlight the historic significance of this hour.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents were collecting all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on its way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had an approval rating of 82%.
And then I close the book.
To switch back to the present is a nasty awakening, like being ripped from a dream.
It is difficult to recall those optimistic times, but they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first voted, something has actually changed.
But it's just not something I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and diverse things that Obama has accomplished, from passing the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, ending the forced concealment of homosexuality in the military, and killing Osama bin Laden.
I too believe that the partisan blockade tactic has tipped the scales on many of the efforts that our nation should be moving forward with: immigration reform, a public option on health insurance, and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after countless times of defending the Obama administration to colleagues and acquaintances, I've come to the end of my attempts to explain.
I've reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows the wiretapping of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It can't explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished for exposing government misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was murdered without due process, nor why public funding and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the findings of a report which says that the White House's efforts to calm the media are the "most aggressive... since the Nixon administration".
And most recently, it can't excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I don't know if this is what I should have expected.
I wonder if I should have understood at 18 that government work could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously the MPs' office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre shape public debate.
But if I look at the examples above, they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative, and he seemed unable to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had been hearing about for so long.
But with Obama's approval ratings dropping to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 has been made all the harder by this book.
It makes me long for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama suffered a heavy loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a meeting with election aides after the ruling, he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic", he said.
We must remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris only.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest in parental leave
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest with his parental leave plans because his daughters are getting pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining tycoon, who is in a court battle over the payment of $6 million in carbon taxes, made the claim when he wanted to clear questions about whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are crucial to the decision whether to remove or cut carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer argued that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets leave or not", Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax, with a 53-vote lead after the recount.
Mr Palmer called for a revision of the vote-counting process to make it faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the voting period?
'We need a better system', he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you can walk in, put the data into a computer, make a call right away, and then have the results at 6:30 p.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils in marking ballots.
Do you use it because you can delete the results if you don't like them?
Toning with pencils these days is unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission has explored the options for electronic voting and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new post "very seriously".
Public office is about service to the public.
"We seek no reward but history, namely, to be able to serve this community at a critical time", he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, according to two people familiar with the situation, another sign that the worldwide regulatory investigation into alleged manipulation of the currency market is picking up speed.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed they are cooperating with the authorities in the investigation of the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that the Libor interbank transaction scandal has brought about.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
"Our investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators", the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people familiar with the matter said that RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now reportedly on leave from his current position as head of European spot forex trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was put on leave this week, and Matt Gardiner, formerly head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from Standard Chartered this week.
None of these dealers have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Usher's Instant Message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people familiar with the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged foreign exchange manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are currently investigating allegations of collusion by bankers in currency market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also opened internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks are sifting through instant messages and emails from years of misconduct.
News of these investigations has caused a stir among traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable investment bank trading units in recent years, but this year has come under pressure as low volatility in currencies limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying that it is nearly impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the huge daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of banks' own internal platforms meant that "one can influence the market with very low ticket prices".
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had this week fired a trader from its London Exchange Traded Funds office after he caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank has promptly informed the relevant authorities and is cooperating with them.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained", said Credit Suisse.
The building fence on the Bechtle property
A group from the Swiss Meadow Citizens' Initiative has beautified the construction fence on the Bechtle plot on the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
She also cleaned and widened the sidewalk, says a press release.
The planned covering of the crumbling house at the rear of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, as the site was in danger of sliding off.
Alfred Abel, who is currently managing the property, had discussed the beautification with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
The campaign was preceded by a banner with the message "We are for".
However, this did not interfere with the action of the 20 or so members of the citizens' initiative.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against Bauruinen".
She was referring to the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
In conversations with many passersby in front of the "building site", it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project will make the city a lot better, although many have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city is still delaying these answers, according to the BI.
As we heard, the mayor's public statements also have an impact.
The Commission has already taken steps to ensure that the newly created European Union is not left to itself.
Some seem genuinely frightened by this, others see it as a "blunt attempt to blackmail" the population, the BI press release continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the paint and all the helpers.
Rangnick's tent for the shark: the Mane is not a king of the swallow
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "Bulls" was disappointed by the referees.
'There is a dangerous tendency at the moment to push Mane and Alan into the category of swallow kings,' he defended the two offensive whirlers on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The latest occasion for Rangnick's criticism was Yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Gr√∂dig last Sunday, where the Senegalese's alleged acting turned into disaster - which was not, of course, as the TV pictures showed.
"A gross misjudgment", said Rangnick, who called Judge Harkam "completely overwhelmed".
Harkam also had contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Gr√∂dig coach Adi H√ºtter after the game.
He firmly defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved in every single situation just like Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself denies having had any contact with his colleague after the skirmish with H√ºtter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who's been insulted", the 46-year-old said.
But in view of the success of the run, Rangnick sang a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for that: really good", he said.
There's not much to expose.
The way the team plays is particularly impressive.
I'm not gonna let that happen again.
There's going to be very little change in the squad during the winter transfer window.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Unless a player comes forward with a desire to leave the club", Rangnick explained.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
It's a big win for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that the health care law closely associated with Barack Obama is constitutional.
By a five to four vote, the justices ruled that the single mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - forcing U.S. citizens to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 - is constitutional under the state's taxing authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy ruled against.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law and further held that the Health Care Act's requirement that states either expand the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise eliminate all state Medicaid benefits was not unconstitutionally restrictive.
The lawsuit against the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The bill had been decisively rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary.
Norway: A Norwegian town lights up with giant mirrors
With giant mirrors, the inhabitants of a small town in Norway have brought light to their dark valley.
Because of the low sunshine, Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, is usually shaded by the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three giant reflectors 45 metres high, a century-old dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" said Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some valley dwellers stood in sunbeds, while others wore sunglasses for safety.
In the past, sun-seekers had to take a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had proposed that the rays be directed into the valley by mirrors.
But this basic idea has been around since 1913.
After years of debate, the city council finally approved the 5 million kroner (about ‚Ç¨615,000) project.
A similar structure has been providing winter sunshine for several years now in the Italian alpine town of Viganella.
Post office is barely empty on Sundays
"Many citizens may not have noticed that the red dots for Sunday clearing are still on various mailboxes in the city centre and the city districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of the Post AG, you will quickly find out that the clearing on Sundays and holidays no longer takes place", the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only the premises at Ernst-Ludwig-Stra√üe 36 and Jakob-M√ºller-Stra√üe 1 in H√ºttenfeld are now cleared.
Whether Hofheim and Rosengarten will be empty on Sunday will not be answered in the reply to the FDP's question.
The social and youth policy spokesman for the FDP, Fritz R√∂hrenbeck, wants to look into this.
Sunday delivery is an important postal service at Terminpost.
"Despite the increase in the price of letters in January 2013, this undertaking is radically and unreasonably thin".
Thomas Bittner, Liberal Group leader and chairman of the Liberal Group, supports his colleagues in the group: 'What annoys me is the fact that the voting times are being changed or cancelled in secret here.'
The postal service is miles away from the public.
"At the very least, the mailboxes in the Neuschlo√ü and Rosengarten districts will have to be emptied on Sundays", Bittner and R√∂hrenbeck said in unison.
The same applies to the inner city, particularly if the citizens are not mobile.
R√∂hrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration plans to talk to the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post office had not communicated with Lampertheim.
But he knows there's a Sunday school in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere", said Maier.
Frankfurt's parking fees are set to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become considerably more expensive.
The city magistrate is deliberating this morning on a motion by the transport department representative Stefan Majer (Greens).
According to the report, parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
The aim is not to raise prices but to reduce the time interval between parking meters and ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
The city council will have to decide in December.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt believes that this is "not a good idea".
The parking facility directly in front of the store is 'a major advantage for smaller retailers'.
The German Transport Association believes that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
The city of joy: Fast action surprises hosts
With a narrow squad, the gentlemen of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG G√∂nningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen.
The √Ñlbers were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
But it soon became clear that, even with age, they could not keep up with the rapid actions of the Freudenst√§dter .
The hard, flat-bottomed bows made the G√∂nninger's struggle extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks leaked by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz through the middle of the net and were not present at the block defense.
Two high first-set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the pleasure-seekers in all matters.
In view of this overwhelming and game-defining performance, the third set was then won somewhat lightly and eagerly to the 3:0 final (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd, TV Baiersbronn, which has clearly established itself in Nagold, will face a much more powerful opponent.
The European Parliament has adopted a resolution on the situation in the European Union.
In the B-class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points, especially in the ball-taking; also in the passes, the precision was sometimes lacking and in some critical game scenes the excess of zeal prevented the look for possible points.
In this very balanced encounter, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently showed the great physical effort and a pleasant commitment of both teams.
Day care at the little English cottage
For the fifth day of care, following the Natura 2000 project in the upper Hotschwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
The mayor of the city, Helmut Kaiser, said that the view of the valley should be cleared on that day in the area of the hut, due to the people's suggestions.
Many hikers, Kaiser said, called this area the "spark of the gorge trail", where the landscape provides the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked the participants for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the Care Day was a suitable instrument to strengthen the link between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to make their own mark on nature.
The Commission has also proposed that the environmental aspect should be taken into account in addition to the tourist aspect.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Nature Conservation Department of the Freiburg Government Office, following the welcome from Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the event a good success.
The tourist destination of the "Widblick" coincides with the aim of preserving the now heavily overgrown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Some species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome the barriers of forested areas.
They need these free connections for species survival.
Tribukait said she wouldn't miss a chance to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure is not just a seamless part of this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the chance for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised UNESCO status and thus a continuous complement to the achievements of the LIFE project and the previous care days for the future.
After these different presentations, the district manager Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been felled in advance, and the logger was ready to take them out if necessary.
A group of helpers were to take care of the clearing of the juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The target was the clear view at the lookout point.
L√∂ffingen: K√∂pfler is still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the small market town of L√∂ffingen can be described as an attractive city with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and elderly policy, and its own municipal works, no second mayoral candidate has yet been announced.
The only candidate to succeed Norbert Brugger, who was no longer running for mayor for reasons of age, is the 46-year-old banker and businessman Dieter K√∂pfler from L√∂ffingen.
The deadline for applications is Monday, November 11th at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of Nortel's previous patents, on Thursday unleashed an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile phone makers, including Google, the company it outsold in Nortel's bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is charged with seven counts of patent infringement.
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus hits the core of Google's search engine business.
The Commission also received comments from interested parties.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making mobile phones that run Google's Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of over $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google has increased its bid several times, most recently to $4.4 billion.
After being outbid by Nortel's patents to Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal that was also partially motivated by Motorola's patent library.
Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the plaintiff patents at auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so, according to the complaint.
Rockstar is seeking a large amount of damages from Google, alleging that Google's patent infringement was intentional, the indictment said.
Egypt swears in first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi is being sworn in, but his triumph should not mean the end of political strife in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 black-robed judges of the court, which sits on the Nile and is modeled after an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic", Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability", said Morsi, 60, a US-educated engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been heavily targeted by governments since its founding 84 years ago, mostly as a banned organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer the new president, and unlike the presidential pomp of Mubarak's time, traffic was stopped only briefly so that the convoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city center to the southern suburbs.
As a non-charismatic "replacement" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists, but of all those who wanted to bring to fruition the ambitions of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state today", Morsi, dressed in a blue suit and red tie, told the judges in the wood-paneled chamber where he took the oath of office.
Later, Morsi traveled to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was officially welcomed by an army band playing the national anthem, which he listened to in the half-mast position.
The military commander, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, was present.
On his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people in the largest auditorium of the university, with chants of "The army and the people are one hand".
Cairo University, founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military junta had taken from the ousted head of state.
But by taking the oath of office in court, rather than in Parliament, as is customary, he is bowing to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger discotheque is making two great nights
The new season has begun at the Blue Velvet discotheque in Falkenberg.
This Friday night is the Pump This Party, and tomorrow night is the U25 Party.
Fats beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers on both days of course.
Worker falls from ladder: seriously injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder and was seriously injured when a defective outer shell was replaced.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the exterior of a guest house.
As he climbed the ladder to the roof gutter, the gutter slipped and the man fell to the concrete floor.
He was seriously injured and was taken by the rescue helicopter Christophorus 6 to the Salzburg State Hospital.
Rapist in South Africa: twice sentenced to life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim later died of his injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty of the crime earlier in the week.
The act had caused national horror.
The then 21-year-old raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial estate in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, the doctors fought to save the victim's life, but to no avail.
The sight of the youths was so horrific that the nurses and nurses needed psychological counseling.
Kana had admitted during the trial that he had been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the crime.
He also confessed to beating and raping her, but he denied being responsible for the girl's death.
Police initially assumed that several perpetrators had been involved, but released two suspects from custody because of insufficient evidence against them.
The prosecution also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost a daily occurrence in South Africa, with some 64,000 reports of sexual violence reported each year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has a far larger population than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's organizations in South Africa estimate the unknown number of sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times higher.
Jumbo is visiting the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo", the Pro7 star visited the Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham are the pig bones, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
So can ham that you get in any supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, the head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains to Jumbo how the company "Adler" in Bonndorf works.
"Germany's favourite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
He's wearing a hair mask and a coat to get inside the factory.
Even Jumbo has to disinfect his hands before he can reach the microphone.
Jumbo for strengthening fast food spotted in Waldshut
"This is where the big fat is made", the TV producers say, "Black Forest ham is mass-produced".
16,000 clubs a week is a lot to ask.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what is important in quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months of age.
TV with a level?
Details such as the pH of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH.
"I wonder what will happen when you kill Roberto Blanco", Jumbo said cynically.
Here the level of private television in pure culture is presented.
But it's still worth watching.
The viewer sees that the dismantling of the blocks is still a manual task.
Because Black Forest ham is traditionally found on the shelf without bones.
The secret to ham is the spice mixed with salt.
The smoke and smoke-firing make the Jumbo look like a submarine.
The trick is that the pine branches here in the smoke give the Black Forest ham its special flavor.
20 days in the smoke will eventually make the ham almost black.
"Now the disk disappears in the Jumbo", he announces the test feeding.
"It's really good", the TV star concluded.
It's gonna be a living for all involved.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past, thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be bucking the trend.
The company has raised its profit outlook for the full year and is expecting record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted pre-tax profit of between $325 and $340 million for the year, compared with $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If current targets are met, this would mean a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the 2011/12 period.
As announced by Managing Director Graham Turner, Flight Centre made eight per cent profit in the first half of the year and made a strong start to the second half, particularly in the Australian and British private sector.
"Our 10 countries have been profitable since the beginning of the year and some are on track for record annual earnings before interest and taxes", he said.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically among our strongest earning countries.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker market for business travel.
The leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK did similarly well, while business customers also spent less.
US business recovered from the seasonally weak first half of the year, so that a full year profit is expected for the third year in a row.
Flight Centre stock was up 3 cents yesterday at $38.20.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on math, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will be required to cover at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The test also includes 'reviewed texts' to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015 students will be required to take a separate GCSE examination for language, with strong incentives for choosing English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will be releasing the new English and Maths curricula tomorrow, the first subjects to be radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the examinations regulator, will announce a reorganisation of GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech this summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was a 'widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence', stressing that GCSEs would become 'more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous'.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics - 116 hours per year, or three hours per week per school year - than most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year, and Singaporean students receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that the comprehensive maths test  combined with a stronger emphasis on the subject in rankings  will likely encourage schools to provide more hours.
The curriculum gives more emphasis to "real life problems", including financial mathematics.
Lovely animals and delicious cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colors are presented by the county association performance show this weekend at the town hall.
The evaluations were already carried out on Thursday.
Once again, the local association W514 is hosting this great exhibition.
Breeders from the Soest region show their best animals and young rabbits from the hobby.
On Thursday, six judges evaluated the many rabbits and were able to award outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed, since the ratings of all the animals are attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be made by Mayor Hermann Arndt at 2.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors from 10 a.m. on Saturday and from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, after which the victory parade begins.
Guests are also invited to a raffle featuring substantial prizes and to a delicious cafeteria.

Johanna Rahner at the Salem Forum for Ecumenical Dialogue with the Pope
The next Ecumenical Dialogue Forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle, will be on the topic "On Hell with Hell - Theological Reflections on the Present-Day Dealing with the Last Things".
The lecturer is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Church communities of Salem, the Castle of Salem and the cultural office of the Lake District.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people in past centuries had known too much about it, relying on those images of heaven and hell "that still shape our ideas", then the modern prophetic teaching of hope for fulfillment would be characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greatest hope of Christians has been properly expressed by religious criticism", says the author.
It has "provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks".
"But the real challenge is the annoyance of death", says Dr. Rahner.
This is linked to the question of that longing "which dreams that all may be well in the end".
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She graduated in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
He completed his habilitation in Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology at the University of Westphalia Wilhelms in 2003.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a chair in Systematic Theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Hostages: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleine Heuberg confirm their faith at the confirmation
Two church services have been held to sign 101 15- and 16-year-olds to the pastoral care unit in Am Kleinen Heuberg.
The morning service was accompanied by the Laudato-Si group, and the afternoon service by the youth choir The Spirit.
By receiving the sacrament of confirmation, the youths said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
The Firmlings had been preparing for the big day for the past few months, under the direction of Deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous parishioners.
In various projects they got to know various tasks of the Christian community life and experienced the Youth Day in the Underground State.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race, enthusiastic participants
In fine weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the circuit over the hill ranges surrounding the lake.
This is reported by Ulrich Knobel of the Illmensee sports club.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance of over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, there were also numerous cyclists of all ages who wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good placings in the German championships.
These two were able to leave the field as expected.
Like last year, Felix Bader was able to save a small lead until the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was in second place again.
In the women's division, it was Theresa Duelli of Team Nightmare who made it to the top of the podium.
In second and third place were Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen.
A welcome development is the growing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not just in terms of performance, but the whole spectrum of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from 10 years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
This year, the main race had more top athletes in the starting lineup.
Four riders were able to distinguish themselves from the regional top riders.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike racer from the Black Tusk Racing Team.
Pangerl and a teammate were two-time world champions in the 12-hour race.
In that year he became European champion in this special discipline.
And with him is Roland Ballerstedt, who has already won two German titles in the duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, it came to a wimps final in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Just one second behind, the routine Ballerstedt could secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann finished third overall.
In the women's category, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
The second place was secured by Areane Blersch from Binzwangen ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
The athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organised running of the event.
Walking through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical care to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for every 5,000 people
Please dial here or on your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to vote for him as the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father lose consciousness time and again, traveling to hospitals that lacked the resources to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaound√©, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but then inflammation spread to his brain, causing a hematom that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon", said Georges Bwelle.
We would have gotten him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy", says Bwelle.
You can leave your house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 persons.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonians would not be able to afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health care spending is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty", Bwelle says.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaound√©.
He also started a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into minibuses and drive the medical equipment, strapped to the roof, across unpaved terrain to villages in need of help.
Things don't always go as smoothly as they should.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed like heroes: a feast, song and dance and the finest accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle  with his wide smile and boundless energy  is happy to join in the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team begins examining hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip", said Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village  and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations are usually carried out in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the O.R. and the disinfection equipment are fed by the group's generator, and so Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a grueling process, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They drum all night long so we can stay awake and continue our work", says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will head back to town, tired but proud of the work they've done.
The group - a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - performed 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their work makes a huge difference to the people they help.
One man explained that the free surgery he received for a hernia now enables him to return to work.
"This changes the future of my family", the man said.
In addition to his weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaound√©.
This second job finances 60% of his charity work, Bwelle said, with the rest coming from private donations.
"I really don't know when he sleeps", says Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia who volunteers with Bwel's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe to support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain hands-on experience that they would never get back home.
"We can be present during surgeries, helping to draw blood or holding instruments for Dr. Bwelle", explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a second-year medical student.
Students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon and often bring donated sanitation.
But once they are in Yaound√©, Bwelle provides accommodation, transportation, and guidance.
"He is a hero, without a doubt", says O'Malley.
He has dedicated his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon knows no bounds.
Bwelle does not find the almost constant work a burden.
Helping others to live happier lives and thus fulfill a promise he made to his Father brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job", says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

‚ô™ Mastered the fight ‚ô™
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is a perfect fit for Horst Janson.
Janson is an old rabbit in his profession, acting.
You can't fool old man Santiago when he's fishing.
The two complement each other perfectly.
One almost thinks one can see the wrinkles on the old man's neck that the fisherman boy Manolo speaks of.
When Santiago sits on the chair, tired of life, it's real with Janson.
Besides, the old fisherman's part is a character role that Janson perfectly masters.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who doesn't give up and who ultimately, through his knowledge and also his willpower, wins the fight against the fish.
Janson is widely known as a solo performer on stage.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself so that his monologues are not a moment boring.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the audience forgets that the sea is made up of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann plays the old man in the boat outside the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the scene in which each of them is active: The Santiago hut, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings with her songs and her magnificent voice the spirit of life of Cuba.
The four musicians play the rhythm of Cuba and are guests of the bar.
Tourism: The Descent to the Romans
A Roman sewerage canal is preserved about 120 metres below Cologne.
If you're visiting Cologne, you can't miss the cathedral.
Its two towers rise to a height of some 157 meters, making it the second-tallest church building in Europe.
But few visitors who admire the two filigree towers of the cathedral realize that there is much to discover beneath the dome.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on the Cologne underworld.
The meeting point for his tours is the service centre of K√∂ln-Tourismus directly at the cathedral.
The tour starts in a very unspectacular way: "We start in the underground garage", says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a self-sustaining city, so only what was not too big remained of the remains of the old city wall.
Most users of the car park today therefore also rush past the Roman remains and only park their car.
But if you look closer, you will find an archaeological site in the parking deck D2, separated by metal bars.
The ruins are about 15 feet [5 m] high and made of hand-sized stones.
"These are remnants of the Roman city walls that were built in the second half of the first century A.D"., says Schulze.
Before the sun comes up again, Schulze lets the participants on the upper level of the park take a look inside a dark, 50-foot-deep shaft.
This is the old cathedral fountain, which is also hardly noticed.
The next stop on the tour is the Praetorium, where the participants descend back into the deep.
We are witnessing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Praetor of the CCAA.
A visitor wants to know what CCAA means.
"The abbreviation stands for 'Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium,' which in good German means as much as 'City of Roman Law and City of the Agrippines, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the cult of the emperor.'"
And the Praetorium is the former governor's palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the exhibition hall, a tunnel leads to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here to a length of about 400 feet.
"You can walk along the Cloaca Maxima if you want", Schulze encourages the guests.
Schulze has a surprise.
After retrieving the key from the register, he leads the group to a 25-foot-deep, walkable shaft.
"We are now in the mikvah, a Jewish ritual bath", he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to access the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing.
To this day, the lower end of the Mikve, whose origins date back to the eighth century, is marked by varying water levels due to the changing level of the Rhine.
The mikvah will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, with construction due to begin shortly.
But it will take several years to complete.
Leg almost chopped off: new edition of the Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is being re-rolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted murder, dangerous bodily injury and damage to property against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Frankfurt (Oder) district court.
He's accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants are silent at the opening.
They are said to have been active in the rock scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
The prosecutor's office accuses them of stabbing and beating three men in a car in Finowfurt in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices.
All the victims were seriously injured, one man almost lost his leg.
The victims are believed to be members of the rival group, the Hells Angels.
One of them was supposed to be a high-ranking member from Berlin.
It appears that a multiple-car chase had taken place.
The prosecution says it was a case of territorial fighting and a show of force.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been identified.
The Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice) set aside the judgment after review by the public prosecutor and referred the case back to the Landgericht (Regional Court) for a new trial.
One of the defendants is currently in open prison for another offense.
The opening session was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the course of the night.
The Commissioner in charge of the investigation at the time was called as a witness.
The center was a collection of cell phone calls from the defendants and others intercepted by the police.
The difficult thing is that rockers almost always stick to a law that is right for them in court - and not testify.
The same goes for the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt (Oder) Public Prosecutor's Office said that new evidence had emerged since the last trial.
The trial is scheduled for 11 more days.
The throwaway society doesn't think
It's been a long night, the music's loud, the mood's good, but eventually, you go home.
But the stomachs of the people in the passenger and back seats are hungry.
Of course, some cocktail or some sparkling wine may be responsible!
What's closer than feeling like driving to the nearest drive-in to get a little something?
I admit, I like to be in the mix when it comes to late-night or early-morning fast-food joints.
A couple of fries, a Coke, a burger, and then nothing but home and to bed!
But on the way home, I noticed the obvious difference between myself and the other hungry disco crowd.
For what is there to be lacking in a person who regularly throws his fast-food bags out of the car window?!
Especially on weekends, discarded paper bags are found on roadsides and in car parks.
"Why?" I ask myself.
Are people too dumb to take the bags home or to the next garbage can?
It's not just that the paperwork is messing up the landscape.
Bags have also covered roadway structures such as guardrails, causing accidents.
The "throwaway society" does not think about such things, and probably does not even know what the word means.
If you are often out at night, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after a night of partying: clothing, bottles, and other trash piles up.
A few bags more or less would not matter, unlike the street where no one wants to trample on the leftovers of others.
I see the day coming when towns and cities will be too dumb to clean up and fast food chains will have to charge for their bags.
Obama's backsliding on health policy
After much criticism, President Obama yesterday backtracked on his oft-repeated, unambiguous promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it".
After hundreds of thousands of people received a letter of resignation from their insurance company, Republicans have been accusing the president in recent days of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relaxed his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance policy can keep it", he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports of the firings, Obama urged those Americans who had received such communications to look for new insurance in the open market.
This would allow most citizens to have better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or at lower prices than forecast.
"You're coming up with a better offer", he said.
The government said it was not surprising that the five percent of the population who had insurance would have to look for another plan because their contracts did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
'I want to say directly to these Americans: you deserve better,' Sebelius said at a hearing before the House of Representatives' Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform since October has been "miserable".
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else", she said.
I'm determined to win back your trust.
This statement from an angry Sebelius to a counselor sitting behind her at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was taken after a heated argument with Missouri Republican Representative Billy Long over whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long repeatedly confronted Sebelius with the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily forgo a government-sponsored insurance policy to sign a plan on HealthCare.gov that she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
The government in Jerusalem confirms the attack on Syrian air base is not
A US government official, who asked to remain anonymous, told CNN on Thursday that Israeli warplanes had attacked an air base in Latakia, Syria, the day before.
The target was "missiles and related equipment" that the Israeli government feared were destined for the Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media and the Arab channel Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was fired upon on the night of Wednesday to Thursday, and blamed the Israelis for it.
Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the Latakia base showing Russian S-125 Newa missile defense systems and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which Channel 2 said have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry up to 70 kilograms of warheads.
The uncertain government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, Reuters news agency quotes an unnamed Israeli government official as saying that he believes Israel carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defense said, "We do not comment on these reports".
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai highlighted in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime has previously tried, and partially succeeded, in supplying surface-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be to cross a "red line" and would be met with a military response.
John Kerry makes an unprecedented admission that US spying has gone "unreasonably far"
John Kerry, in an unexpected admission, signaled a softening of the US's defensive stance towards its surveillance programs, saying that the spying had gone "unreasonably far" in certain cases.
The secretary of state also admitted that he shared with Barack Obama the responsibility for switching to "autopilot" when whistleblower Edward Snowden's explosive revelations about the NSA's spying activities became public.
The leak of information has thrown the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
In a video address at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "Without question, the President and I and others in government have learned of some things that have gone off on what is essentially an autopilot, simply because the ability to do so existed, going back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, 9/11".
He then became the first senior member of the US government to admit that the US spying had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: "In some cases, the inappropriate has gone too far".
The president is determined to make things clear, and that's why he's conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there's been abuse.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons will not be impaired in this process.
But Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance efforts had saved many lives.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are ready to blow themselves up".
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing up things and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have known about such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged US spying and to convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in counterterrorism efforts, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to withdraw from anti-terrorist organizations due to frustration with the National Security Agency's surveillance.
"It is very important to the national security interests of the United States that Europeans stay on board with our joint efforts to fight terrorism", Murphy, a Democrat first elected to the Senate and chairman of the Senate's Foreign Relations and European Affairs Committee, said in an interview in Washington.
I'm also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger at the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has intercepted millions of phone records in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, though the head of the intelligence service this week said the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended the spying on allies as necessary, saying it was common on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said his office was preparing for the trip of the Congress to be held this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other Members taking part will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy emphasised that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words".
He said European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of spying programs they themselves have been using for years.
'While we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones spying,' said Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to address the resentment over US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, and US surveillance activities.
A persistent ankle injury threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai M√ºller in the Bundesliga away game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is calling for a mission from Nicolai M√ºller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the team.
So far, he's only been able to do that on an individual basis.
"We will decide on his appointment in the near future", said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best six-goal scorer on board.
Because the Mainzers already have to do without the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman appeals against Thailand jail sentence
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, has appealed the verdict and has been released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making a false statement after she told the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men were holding her.
However, later, video camera footage showed that she had safely reached her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the story.
Until the court hearing, she was in police custody at the scene.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security prison on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian rugby league player who turned to the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are of course very worried, but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible", Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed the verdict and is free on bail of 50,000 baht.
Australian reports said she was vacationing in the resort town of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Outside the court, Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand may be trying to improve its battered tourist image after the recent murder of tour operator Michelle Smith in Phuket, and therefore an acquittal is being sought.
