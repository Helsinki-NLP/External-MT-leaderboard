Members of the Welsh Assembly Worried They May Be Identified as Muppets
Several members of the assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposed change of their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh parliament).
This controversy has arisen from the plan to change the name of the assembly to Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all the different political parties have expressed their concern that this measure could become a mockery.
A Labour party assembly member has claimed that his party was concerned about the fact that MWP rimes with Twp or Pwp.
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly has commented that the whole of his party no see it with good eyes and has proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh Conservative member has claimed that his group was showing obert in the face of the name change, but also commented that there is too little difference between the term MWP and Muppet.
In this context, it should be noted that the letter w in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
According to the committee of the assembly in charge of drafting the legal draft to introduce the name changes: The final decision on any qualification to name the members of the assembly will of course fall on the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly full power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with widespread support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of members of the assembly, although the committee opted for Members of the Welsh parliament or WPM, the option of MWP is the one that received wider support in the public consultation.
It seems that members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives, however, the attempt to reach a consensus may be a bit of a misfortune for the speaker of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in a matter of weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will hold the final vote on their denomination during the debate related to the legislation.
Macedonians will vote in referendum to change their country's name
Citizens will choose on Sunday whether or not to change their country's name to Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are of the opinion that the name change is simply the price one has to pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Bells of St. Martin's Stop Ringing: The Troubles of Harlem Churches
"Historically, the older people I've spoken to say there was a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams says.
Today, there is none left, of the two.
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
"People have a different way of socializing these days", he says.
"The bars are no longer the kind of neighborhood living rooms where people used to go periodically".
As for the churches, they are concerned that the money they get from selling assets won't last as long as their leaders predict - and sooner or later they'll go back to where they came from.
Churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who won't be of any help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condos in these buildings will be white", he says, "and so what they're going to do is accelerate the closing of all the churches, because it's highly unlikely that most of the people who move into these condos will end up being members of those churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left during the 1930's.
A nearby black congregation acquired the property.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused severe damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the carriage.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to his position at St. Martin's Church, proudly described the carriage as "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who sounded the carillon in July described it differently: A cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first carriage in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the larger carriage at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been ringing in St. Martin's over the past few months, on the contrary, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing concern that the diocese pretended to pass on the costs to the council, although the latter was not involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old boy while hunting for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the first day of lobster season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he was out diving for half an hour with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy's cries for help, and then they rowed with a group to the location where the boy was to help him out of the water.
Hammel says that at first he thought it was the joy of catching a lobster, but then he realized that he was screaming 'I've been bitten!
I was bitten!'
He had his entire clavicle stripped off, Hammel observed when he got to the boy.
"Because everyone was coming out of the water, I shouted, 'There's a shark in the water!' " adds Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not known what species of shark was responsible for the attack.
At a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles commented that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed for 48 hours access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas because of the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete at Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty product aisles in the style of busy department stores with specialist employees.
These large corridors are just one part of a considerable investment in the UK beauty market, a market worth some £2.8 billion and continuing to grow while the fashion and home goods sectors lag behind, and will be tested in 11 stores across the country to expand to more stores next year if the trial is successful.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the supermarket's greed to take advantage of the space in its lending facilities that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's claims it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also get more space with brand areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are now vegan-friendly, an aspect increasingly in demand by younger consumers.
The Fragrance Shop retail chain will also open two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the shift to the habit of buying food in smaller quantities each day in smaller supermarkets has forced larger supermarkets to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, the stores will increasingly resemble large department stores in the supermarket chain's attempt to fight the discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos outlets in many of its supermarkets, as well as a number of Habitat stores since acquiring both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to boost food sales and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The supermarket chain's previous attempt to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's did a joint-operation trial with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended abruptly in disagreement over how to split the pharmacy chain's profits inside supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of its 281 pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for £125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the overall plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands of leather products, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have transformed the look of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have invested in specially trained workers who will be of great help in offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to fit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and convenient location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way of shopping.
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby backs out of an £11 million deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby backed out of an £11 million deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the Truly home goods and accessories business.
The business of these two media personalities had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones enraged by withdrawing at the last minute from the lucrative lifestyle brand joint venture to focus on her new own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring her big profits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furious" when the red-haired TV star admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at her empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new £1.5 million deal for the presenter meant she would no longer have enough time to devote to the Truly joint brand of household goods and accessories.
The business had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private jet en route to one of his holiday residences outside the UK.
According to a source, "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was meant to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision to back down left all parties involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to launching...
Right now there's a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow's headquarters ready to be sold.
Experts say the departure of the This Morning host, one of the UK's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment in products, from cushions and splinters to clothing and homewear, and the possibility of delays to its launch.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we will not comment on his business".
Hard accusations... and then we fell in love
He made fun of the possible criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider "not appropriate for a president" and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump quit so much?
Trump stated, all the while poking fun at the tone of voice of a news anchor:
I've never given up on anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first held in Singapore in June was declared a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations towards denuclearization are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "correspondence response" from the U.S. to its first disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted, the US continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump's view, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we have this great relationship.
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: an end to missile tests, help to free hostages and return home of the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded building, we'd have about 200", Trump said, all while pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A devastated island and hundreds of dead from tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, NGOs in other countries were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for international aid to be catalyzed.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding", Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreigners will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies are allowed to contribute in providing aid.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country is unfortunately still unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a tsunami warning in effect, is very likely to have contributed to the death toll.
Moving between Indonesia's vast number of islands is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is now heading to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia's poor infrastructure, and has invested enormous amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government faces the next year's re-election burdened with funding deficits.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's ongoing sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced people are the result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores the fourth goal with a long shot against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with his goal scored in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal as his team were losing 1-0.
He settled the ball to the left before letting go of an incredible shot aimed at the second pole.
The shot crossed the entire area with a great elevation as it propelled itself towards the right cross of the goalkeeper.
The ball finally started its descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kanté coming, I made a touch and didn't think much about it, I just dedicated myself to playing.
Chelsea won 1-0 at half-time after scoring a goal in the 25th minute via their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, the Blue team's forward returned a pass to Mateo Kovacic before starting from almost midfield and sprinting to Liverpool's field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from midfield.
He then made a magnificent deep pass, which left Hazard inside the area with the ball under control.
Hazard overcame the defence to finish on the second stick with a left-footed shot that failed to reach Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League next Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for their part, will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll reaches 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency, released on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped among the rubble of collapsed buildings due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the rubble of destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding a woman stabbed
The murder investigation has been launched after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with multiple scratches in Grayson Mews, John Street; subsequently, a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked residents of the area who have seen or heard anything in connection with the crime to report to the authorities.

I would also like to call on anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything through the onboard camera of the car, to contact us, as they may have vital information for the investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
While the investigation continues, police have commented that they are informing the victims' closest relatives.

The Cromwell statue in the British Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the debate around "rewriting history".
Their disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the purest Taliban style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main targets.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor over the previous century.
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case obviously from the monarchy.
Whether or not this fact constitutes a totally accurate representation remains a matter of historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A killer pig kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, local sources report.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pigsty in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs with vaccines in a yard in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As far as is known, he had traveled on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to an adjacent pigsty.
According to him, there was a large male pig in the courtyard with blood in its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kg shell had fatally wounded the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had his legs torn and full of blood", said the cousin, surname Wu, as reported by the evening news in Guiyang.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the evening news that the pig was kept locked up and isolated to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene of the crime.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although very rare, previously recorded cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig grabbed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife could scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't go with the idea of doing harm.
We just need to give them the respect they deserve", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, typical of a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. eastern U.S. time Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastward toward the U.S. west coast. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a strong tropical moisture northward toward the southwestern U.S.
El Rosa will drop up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical moisture will interact with the approaching depression to generate torrential rains that will sweep across the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, waste streams and the possibility of land slides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of about 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
50 to 100 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially much of Arizona.
There is a possibility of rivers forming, as the situation is deteriorating very rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is completely discouraged to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrollable rivers, and storms can bring wind gusts and dust clouds to specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains to select points along the coast of Southern California.
It is possible that precipitation totals above 50 mm are recorded, which could cause minor waste streams and slippery paths.
It would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Isolated pockets of tropical rain will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday night.
Torrential rains will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October will see several major temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain fairly warm.
This phenomenon can occasionally cause drastic temperature changes at short distances.
The central region of the United States on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected to begin October with heat in much of the central and eastern United States, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the southern Plains area to parts of the northeast.
New York City could get up to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there is a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's speech
More than 20 million viewers watched the heartwarming testimony Thursday by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, broadcast on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with broadcasters interrupting their usual Friday programming due to a last-minute twist in the events: an agreement engineered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in exalted testimony, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers saw this testimony on Friday.
The company averaged viewership from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience figures were not immediately available from other channels that rebroadcast the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has trouble calculating the number of people who see him from his office.
Putting it in perspective, it's an audience similar to a football playoff game or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the most-watched channel, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the day's testimony, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS earned 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to data from Nielsen.
Interest remains high after the testimony.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he was rattled by protesters as he tried to climb an elevator to attend a Judiciary Committee hearing.
Flake remained for several minutes with his eyes battered as he was rebroadcast live on CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They told her, 'You have power, whereas so many women don't have it!'
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, commented that he would have more to say in the committee's hearing.
Within hours, all cable and broadcast networks were already broadcasting live the moment when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on whether or not to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate to put it to a vote.
Flake said, however, that he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the nominee by next week, a condition demanded by the Democratic minority.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option Flake chose had influence, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and of disregarding the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview besides the one with May on the front page, May's former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that the UK and EU collect taxes on each other is "absurd".
Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU team player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was a member of the LSU basketball team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene of the crime and say they have found Simpson's DNA in them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted to killing Wayde with a shotgun, according to police.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the state police forensics lab, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to this arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the area's law enforcement for their "diligence" and for seeking justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was a 6-foot-3, 200-pound shooting guard and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds as a starter last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "destroyed" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow".
"Things like that are what make you suffer all the time", Wade said.
A spitting volcano burns in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center was monitoring several recent tremors and tremors.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in volcanic activity located 72 km southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police confront Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-vaal police and thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on its secession.
A group of independence-seeking individuals held by the anti-vallout police began throwing eggs and painting them in dust, which caused dark clouds of dust to appear on the streets normally overrun by tourists.
Later that day, clashes broke out with the police, who used their batons to contain the violent protesters.
For several hours, independence groups chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive" face to face with unionist protesters who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not abated in this region of independenceist mentality a year after a referendum was held on October 1st, which was considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a large majority, although the turnout was low, as opponents of secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting by entering polling stations across the region, which led to violent clashes.
The separatist groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence rally along with his wife, said he no longer had much hope about the possibilities that Catalonia would achieve independence.
Last year was one of the best times we had.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we are stuck", she commented.
Despite achieving a vital victory, albeit by a narrow margin, in the autonomous elections in December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, as many of their main leaders are in self-imposed exile or detained waiting to be judged for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the demonstration in support of the police with his phone, and claims that the conflict has been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is only increasing", he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed before trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Presenting myself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after invading a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Detective Bob Blemmings says damage was done to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point someone fired a crossbow at the car.
A play by Menga gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston was the winner
Livingston, who had climbed the ladder this year, surprised Glasgow Rangers in what is just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox neighbourhood club.
Dolly Menga's play made a difference, as with this victory, Gary Holt's team moved up to second place, which they share with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side, meanwhile, continue to win the Premiership away from home this season, and next Sunday will face the leader, Hearts, who are eight points behind.
But before that, the Rangers are hosting the Vienna Rapids in the Europa League this Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends their undefeated streak to six games in the league, with a Holt as coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston doesn't take his chances in front of the visitors' live game
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the score long before the goal, as his direct play caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way through the backfield, but squandered his opportunity when he found himself in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow sent the ball out in a stretch to attempt to finish off Craig Halkett's head pass, which crossed the goal.
The locals were fine with letting the Rangers approach their area, as they knew they could get visitors in trouble in isolated plays.
And that's how that decisive goal came about.
The referee whispered a foul against Rangers' interests and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so Menga could play it first and finish from the central part of the area.
Up until that point, the Rangers had dominated possession, but they found themselves with an impenetrable defense and a goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had very little to do throughout the game,
The scenario was repeated in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a stop of merit.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman on one occasion and Lithgow ended up deviating another Livingston combination play.
The Rangers engaged in repeatedly hanging balls in the Livingston area, only to be rejected, and two penalties were claimed, one for an alleged entry by Halkett to substitute Glenn Middleton, and another by hand, both of which were dismissed.
Livingston  phenomenal: analysis of the work of the
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
One man thinks they've been excellent, and they're still exceeding all expectations on this upward trajectory.
His style of play and staff have hardly changed since his return to the top flight, although much of the credit has to be attributed to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, at the head of a perfectly organised defence, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be on Menga's heels throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments exhibited with Gerrard as coach, they definitely have not been able to maintain the level.
They didn't know how to create chances (only once did they clearly outperform the home defense), and that the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, should be taken as a warning.
Bittersweet reception for Erdogan in Cologne
All smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at repairing relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
And it's that this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, although a large number of supporters flocked to the surrounding area to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also took to the streets condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinion around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titled dictator by others.
Deptford traffic accident: cyclist dies after crashing into car
A cyclist has been killed as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily-traffic area of Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedics attended to the cyclist, he died on the spot.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said their officers are working to identify the man and report the incident to the next of kin.
The street has been cut and detours have been applied to bus routes, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prisoner: Six officers wounded in altercation
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at this high-security men's prison, according to the center's office.
The events took place at Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, at around 09:30 local time on Sunday, and are still ongoing.
Specialist agents from the Tornado were dispatched to the scene to put an end to the altercation, which has involved eight inmates.
Officers had to be treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
According to a prison service spokesman, "We have deployed specially trained prison personnel to try to resolve an incident at Long Martin Prison that is still ongoing".
Six employees have had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we know that those responsible for this altercation will be held accountable by the police and may spend even more time in jail.
Long Lartin Penitentiary houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief had to be treated in a hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, in October last year, anti-vaccine agents made a show of presence in the prison to resolve a serious altercation in which staff at the center were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with significant flooding (drought areas could benefit)
It's not unusual for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week when what's left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, with the consequent risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Rosa is expected to make its way directly to Phoenix on Tuesday and will make landfall on Monday night with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service commented in a bulletin that only two tropical cyclones have maintained storm or tropical depression status within a 200-mile (322 km) radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was 40 miles (64 km) from the Arizona border.
The most recent models from the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where up to 150 mm would be recorded at the Mogollon in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, could record 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points of up to 100 mm.
For areas that are out of risk of flooding, the Rosa rain could become very good news, as the region is suffering from a severe drought.
Although flooding is a serious cause for concern, some of the rainfall could prove very beneficial, as the southwest region is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Control Service, more than 40 percent of the state of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
El Rosa continued to have hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is moving into cooler waters in the Pacific, which is making it less powerful.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or evening.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be heavy, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, 75 to 150 mm of rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 250 mm.
After that, Rosa will head north through Mexico in tropical storm strength, before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning in tropical depression strength, finally crossing the state of Arizona and reaching southern Utah late Tuesday night.
The main risk we expect from Rosa or what's left of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert of the southwest USA, according to the National Hurricane Center.
The rains are expected to cause dangerous flooding and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with scissors in Somerset.
The teenager was found with injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 4:00 a.m. local time Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he is stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the following day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
Officers have issued a call for anyone who may have any kind of cell phone recording of the incident to contact us.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered the petty anger of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump declared at a ballot in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered the petty anger of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she sexually abused her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing in connection with his allegation.
The president said Saturday that on that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, humanity and courage".
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the most brilliant minds in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an admirable track record of public service", he told the crowd of sympathizers in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment while speaking about the importance of the Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I didn't run, but I actually did, he said.
That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for our great candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats are engaging in "resistance and obstruction".
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place as late as Friday, an aide to Republican Party leaders told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where casualties continue to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been swept away by giant waves hitting beaches, as a severe earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a beach festival in the city of Palu when waves of up to six metres hit the coast towards dusk, dragging many of the people to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, so they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it swept away cars, logs, houses, destroyed everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
There are people who climbed up a tree to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster mitigation agency show the number of shops and buildings destroyed, overturned and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake this coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's technology assessment and application agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have increased the magnitude of the tsunami exponentially.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he said, were found trapped in the rubble of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
According to Nugroho, deaths and damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications were completely paralyzed and no information was received from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
This is a tragedy, which unfortunately could end much worse, he said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves came during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording by a fan shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building giving desperate cries of warning to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water bursts onto the seashore, sweeping away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused widespread power outages that have disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Although the army has begun sending humanitarian aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, evacuees are still desperately in need of food, in addition to other basic needs.
The city's airport has reopened for relief duties only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami stands at over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to reach Palu City safely, where employees are hiding in canvas shelters installed in their office yard, they witnessed scenes of total destruction along the way, Doseba says.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's a disaster.
Although aid groups made the heartbreaking gesture of starting relief efforts, some people complained that humanitarian workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fundraising, provisions and staffing from abroad can only start flowing if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Well, it's a national disaster,' we can start asking for international assistance, but that level hasn't been declared yet".
As the second night passed in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that occurred on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing kept hoping for the miracle to occur and their loved ones laughed at the devastating account of the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy trapped in a sewer was rescued.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rune for two days with her mother's body next to it.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Besides Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he pointed out.
Mr. Gendon explained that in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse circulated among the parapsychologist community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a double blue check mark.
"I think that means the messages were not received", he added.
Thieves take $26,750 during a cash-filling machine in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling out an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy indicated in the release that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While doing his job, another man ran up behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money intended for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "Being formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while, and used that alias as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for emotional reasons, according to the show's author.
Aside from being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you", West said earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good side, our bad side, our confused side, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former collaborator of West, has used his surname with or without script and in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andres Manuel López Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that never again would military force be used to repress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the deaths of 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador, who has pledged to support Mexican youth by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people attracted to criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for AI
"As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money it spends on research in this field", says Kai-Fu Lee, an artificial intelligence investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the US government announced AI measures, despite the country's general lack of a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the number one in the world for AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that the rest of the world is far behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in AI", Lee said.
"Doubling funding could double the chances of the U.S. achieving the next big breakthrough in AI", Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent AI companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that surpassed the American player from Othello with the best rating and, subsequently, served as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively evaluated previous U.S. Government technological competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify the next visionaries.
"Often, American researchers have to work hard to get public grants", Lee said.
According to Lee, it's not China that's taking over academic leadership; it's the corporations.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university eminents to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that the US work in the field of AI could also be seen to be boosted by changes in immigration policy.
"I think that permanent residence cards should be automatically offered to IA PhD students", he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its latest-generation AI Development Plan.
"The National Natural Science Foundation of China gives funds to people in academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Science Foundation and other public agencies in the US give money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is inferior to China", Lee pointed out.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve collaborators from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of an Artificial Intelligence Select Committee.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently allocates over 100 million USD a year to AI research.
Meanwhile, no measures have been implemented for months in relation to the US legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on changing the name to Republic of North Macedonia, a measure that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's membership requests to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic-majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign makes it doubtful whether the minimum 50% turnout required for the referendum to be valid will be reached.
The question on the referendum paper is: Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership, with the agreement with Greece accepted?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created as a result of the breakup of Yugoslavia, to bodies like the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have indicated that they will abide by the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority in Parliament is required.
The State Election Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", declared 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the country's name change, which would open the way for membership in the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads held high, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, like China and Russia, and be part of the Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev stated that a yes would be the confirmation of our future.
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another poll, conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% declared that they would vote Yes.
For the referendum to be valid, turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A referendum failure would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch the video: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scores after bargaining all the Brighton defence
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling overcame Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win in the match played at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) last Saturday.
Agüero scored a goal in the 65th minute in a play that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He ran at speed between three Brighton defenders, tearing what came his way across the field.
Then Agüero saw himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He bargained a defense before overtaking a few more at the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left that found Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball at first touch, inside the area, to Agüero, who with his right foot hit Brighton's goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan, with a shot that slipped inside the net from the right side.
Aguero has foot problems, City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We decided that I would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that point.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball deep in Brighton's field and
He made a beautiful pass to the left-hand side of the space to Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long stick.
The Sky Blues forward finished the ball inside the net before coming out of the back line.
City face Hoffenheim on Tuesday in a Champions League group stage match at 18:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, no choice, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff fight, there was little reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to get out on the pitcher's mound on Sunday coming against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who maintain a game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have a chance to play in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured a wild card with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to win their first division title.
Even if we don't play anything, at least we can get out there and throw knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team is probably going to compete for every point at the highest level, like no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this game?
The Nationals have yet to announce an opening pitcher for Sunday, but they're apparently determined to let Scherzer pitch if that situation arises.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, did a warm-up session on Thursday and would pitch on Sunday, on his usual day off.
The Washington right-hander has an 18-7 record with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the great, great -- I don't run, but I actually do run, so I'm everywhere fighting for the great candidates", he said.
Trump continued: "You can see this horrible, horrible bunch of Democrats, it's happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you can see their petty, their bad intentions.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we're not going to give it to them.
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is to resist and obstruct.
And you can see that in the last four days, he rebelled, and he called the Democrats mean, mean, dirty, fake.
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which prompted a strong public scrutiny.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, wait a minute -- that was a really bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse party.
It's intolerant of those who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of British MPs who have been told we are not welcome, just to say what we think.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she spoke out against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, these are similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The notice of the Friday meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party said that we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings held on Friday nights have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, that's not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of "more generous and kind" policies, if they ever existed, has long been forgotten.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues who I thought shared a similar political vision with before expected me to turn around and take positions that I would never have taken, whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages calling for my candidacy not to be renewed, denouncing the politics of the centre and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the messages I get are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who every day face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and they do not shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is, we're not that diverse party anymore, and with every No-Confidence motion or every change in selection rules, the party got more strained.
Over the last two years, I've been given a lot of advice and I've been advised to keep my head down, not be so expressive and everything will be fine.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my student days, spurred on by the negligent Thatcher government, which left my whole classroom literally in ruins, I have tried to advocate for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will hurt homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in reality, the message I want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of my candidacy being not renewed or any political interest will prevent me from acting in what I believe to be in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an undefeated Ayr lead
Two last-minute attempts distorted the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the win in this vibrant Tennent's Premiership day game.
The Ayres, who are the only undefeated team of the ten, occupy the first position in the standings.
In the end, the home team won thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they knew how to make the most of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
"The matches we have played so far have tested us and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose commented: "Congratulations to the Ayres, they've taken the opportunity better than we have".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, ceded for the match by the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted try.
Climo extended the Ayr's lead with a penalty and, just halfway through, scored and converted a try to put the score 17-5 in favour of the Ayr at half-time.
But the Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Afterwards, the match was interrupted for a long time due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who retired on the sidelines, and at the replay the Ayr once again extended the distance with a try by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Subsequently, alternate captain Blair Macpherson was admonished with a yellow card and, again, the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of one more man with an unconverted try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the home team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to score a goal at Climo without a ball from the penalty line, MacPherson scored a try-out behind the Ayr penetration mole.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the rebound, after Kyle Rowe collected a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to third-row winger Gregor Henry to score the home team's fifth try.
The star of the series Still Game seems to be about to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be about to move into the hospitality industry, after it's been revealed that he's been named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his long-time comedy partner.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the show's last, and it seems Kiernan is planning her life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a source in The Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant sector".
The sea is ours: Bolivia, without a coastline, hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors patrol their warships in La Paz.
Public buildings wave a navy blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are stamped with the slogan: The sea is ours by right.
To get it back is a duty.
Across the landlocked territory of Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, needless to say, it is waiting with a positive attitude for the result", Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, pointed out.
Many Bolivians will watch the TIJ resolution on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign outlet to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much hope for Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised last August.
However, some analysts feel that the Court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia, and if it did, things would not change much.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The TIJ's decision, which comes just six months after the final allegations were filed, indicates that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a setback in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea", Zárate said.
"Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile", he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep talking after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally rapid.
On Monday Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political ploy.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we have to get past it".
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly last Saturday.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come at a time when it appears that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a chimera to think that continued sanctions and the US objection to a declaration ending the Korean War could make North Korea never kneel.
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration unless Pyongyang makes major disarmament moves first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is taking seriously the issue of giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means of ensuring its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of oversized bars, on their way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your barbecue collection or want to protect yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a range of extravagant, disproportionately sized bars from their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which dazzled the style defined at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram was overwhelmed by very impractical bars, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's highlight was an exaggerated beige bar, adorned with a wide, feather-shaped wing, which flooded the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included sickle-shaped spindles, a witch's bar and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extra-flower masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, brightly colored, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a complete scuba diving kit, with tubes and glasses, while another resembled a conch-shaped ice cream cone.
And if you follow the big fashion trends, you're in luck.
Style watchers predict that huge bars could be planted on the main streets near you.
The large bars are stamped on the heels of la Bomba, a two-foot wide-winged, straw bar that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski has worn.
The cult tag behind the bar so impractical that it spread across social media brought another great creation to the catwalk: a beach straw bag, almost as big as the model in the swimsuit wearing it.
The bag of raffia, dark orange, adorned with raffia locks and finished with a white leather duvet, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, considering the designer has had such a big impact, it would be a shame if the demand for large accessories is ignored.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a trajectory of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another string of excellent exam results, which is reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career of their choice and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we observe that modern languages remain a very popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the last year's exams, we can see that languages lead the ranking tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest A grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of students achieved an A-level qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are kept in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in curricula from independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission revealed that of the reasons employers gave for the difficulty of filling vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more potential job opportunities require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find important jobs.
There is diversity in the languages taught in schools in Scotland.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK in the future, towards 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, he or she can always choose from a range of languages at independent schools, which have language-specific teachers.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In the global business environment of the present era, it cannot be denied that languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is practically over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the minutes he's going to play have yet to be determined.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48", Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a few minutes.
After this week's early practice, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to be ready", he rebelled.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign actions tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five meetings Trump is scheduled to hold next week, which include visits to sympathetic locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is pending, Trump aims to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The Trump rally in West Virginia can be viewed online at the link specified below, via live video streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing that began this week with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has been tense over the sexual abuse allegations he faces, while the Senate's anticipated confirmation vote is held pending until a week and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main purpose of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans running in the sensitive November election gain momentum.
So the five Trump campaign meetings scheduled for next week are aimed at stimulating volunteers and supporters, while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can as we head into a busy campaign season", a Trump spokesman who declined to be identified said, according to Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw media coverage from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican nominee for the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: American team shows ambition to keep hopes alive for Sunday's singles matches
After three uneven sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of dynamics is an invented sporting concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So which side is the positive dynamic on now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we're in a small positive range", Jordan Spieth declared as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has a four-point lead, with 12 more at stake.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind is blowing a little in their favor and have plenty of reasons to be excited, largely because of the state of form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural cries of celebration increased in intensity as he continued his lap and he struck a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been down two after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that won them the match on the 15th hole with a similar cry, of the sort that indicates he believes the American team is not out of the competition yet.
"You have to try your best and worry about your own party", Spieth pointed out.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to leave a print.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup sensation.
The strange but adorable European couple wear four of four and make no mistakes.
They were the only couple who did not do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
By this result and the way their energy seems to flow in and out of the buzzing crowd, it is reaffirmed that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to close out a possible European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, it seemed premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning football game, who paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes sunk the Spaniard and Swede into a hole from which they never had any option of getting out.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to watch because of the interactions between the devices, the advice they give and don't give, and the way a strategy can change over and over again.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the final day with a significant advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the US, had questioned.
Europe reaches the Ryder Cup final with a 10-6 score
Europe will face the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable lead after ending Saturday's fourball and foursomes with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to score two wins against a struggling Tiger Woods and set their record, so far, at four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who were aiming to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning's fours and put the series at 3-1.
The U.S. put up more resistance to the foursomes and won two games, but could not narrow the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed to score eight points in Sunday's 12 individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After slapping Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they clinched a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged on in two games on Saturday, showed sporadic spurs of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 games in four-ball and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning's fourballs, again paired with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked as world number one and third, respectively.
Europe, however, had not all that in store for a nice, windy day southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans on Saturday by scoring two points.
They achieved a determined 2-1 victory over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later won back Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point lead in individual matches, although Furyk's defending team only needs to tie to retain the title.
However, after being second best for two days, it seems that a coming Sunday counterattack is out of his reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm in any way unless signs of trust are appreciated
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were intensifying his distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" during the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test center and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any response in line with the US", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not initiate disarmament unilaterally in any way".
While Ri echoed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased denuclearization approach that would reward North Korea as it took steps gradually, his statements seemed significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization outright, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has communicated that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease the tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists that denuclearization must happen first and increases the pressure level with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, in addition to opposing the 'declaration of end of war,'" Ri said.
The perception that sanctions will bring us to our knees is a chimera of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are intensifying our distrust.
Ri did not refer to plans for a second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: If the party involved in the denuclearization issue was South Korea instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached this stalemate situation.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what he maintained last year, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that targeting US territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President Mr. Evil Trump dubbed Kim Rocket Man on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations last year, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much to do and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared Thursday at the UN Security Council that: "The application of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm total and final denuclearization".
The Security Council has pushed for sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006 in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then communicated that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but within hours North Korea accused him of making "gangster-like demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and a nuclear complex if the United States took "measures in accordance".
He said Kim had told him that the "consonant measures" he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised Singapore, in addition to actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are teaching a class on rest habits.
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the increasingly widespread culture of studying all night, stimulated by caffeine.
One scholar observed that students at the world's number one university are often clueless about the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I being told this now, in my senior year?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, first implemented this year, explains the basics of how good sleep habits improve academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after learning that some students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive assignments.
In one section is a picture of a bedroom, where students are asked to click on coffee cups, curtains, blankets, and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how sports performance affects sleep deprivation, and about the importance of maintaining a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, as one has a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes", Professor Czeisler pointed out.
The culture of pride in staying up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students make sleep deprivation an increasing problem.
Ensuring good quality sleep for long enough should be a secret weapon of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation puts the brain into a sleep mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes in his senior year during his freshman year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students be aware of setting alarms when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal sentenced Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 home defeat at Livingston that meant another stumbling block away.
The Ibrox team were looking to add up their first home victory since last February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as coach to leave their team adrift, at 8 points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and it never seemed that the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to even the score.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston move to third, behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers could face more trouble later, as linebacker Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that apparently threw itself from the stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to the line-up that scrapped the Ayres in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came off the same starting eleven that kicked a point against Hearts last week, and he must have felt satisfied with the way his well-organised team smothered their rivals at every turn.
While the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored in the two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder jumped off and missed the big opportunity.
A blunt foul throw from Keaghan Jacobs hit captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow only made a deflected shot to the back of the stick.
The Rangers got the upper hand, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the third quarter.
Alfredo Morelos really believed he should have had a penalty at the fifteen-minute mark, as he and Steven Lawless bumped into each other, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
Rangers only managed two shots on goal in the first half, but Iberrox first-goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problem with the head-shot by Lassana Coulibaly and docile forward Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi in the 34th minute might have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to fight Jacobs' hard-working play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to pick Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break by swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, the change having a virtually immediate impact as the winger made a pass to Morelos, though the impressive Kelly ran into the block.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture the attention of the visitors by playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one behind the other.
Holt's side could have given up the lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow made a deviated shot from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still called for a penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made his eyes heavy.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting -- the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually gave rise to the device we know as the Geiger computer.
The Geiger counter, which has been a mainstay of science ever since, also became a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, seemingly failed cowboy physicists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emanating from radioactivity on the minerals".
Evans: "It must be bursting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and kill malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
You can look at a protein that's common to many cancers and then re-inject them.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear after more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2), and subsequently re-injecting them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A., says: "Our results suggest that we have a promising vaccine".
The HER2 protein favours the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of harvesting immune cells from patients and teaching those cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West got into a pro-Trump argument with a MAGA hat after his performance on the SNL show.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was written into the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump and said he would run in the 2020 election.
After her third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which she wore a Make America Great Again cap, she began to criticize Democrats and reiterate her support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people, they say, 'How can you like Trump if he's a racist?
Well, if I cared about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago", he said.
The SNL show began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well treated behind the scenes because of the hat he wore.
"I was threatened behind the scenes.
I was told not to go out with that hat on.
I was harassed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" while saying that he would put on the Superman cape so that they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to estimate".
His comments prompted public outcry at least twice and the members of the show's team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, which had a reporter who explained to the publication: "The whole study was completely silenced".
West acted as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West left a large portion of the audience perplexed with his rendition of the song I Love it, disguised as Perrier's "Bampulla".
West won the support of TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING OUT IN THE PLURITY".
But the talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that he is absolutely wonderful".
"But I have chosen not to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or by supporting their "art") who I believe adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so do we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly named Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince was renamed for a symbol and, later, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder by stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death on Friday in east Belfast.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is denouncing toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for portraying the role of swordsman Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of a masculine hero, saying that these roles imply that young boys often believe they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said she believed that "something had gone wrong" and that she was questioning how to deal with the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels strongly about dealing with this problem.
"Personally, I now wonder where we've gone wrong with masculinity", he says.
What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?
According to Kit, television may have a part to play in the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its virile characters.
He added: "What is innate and what is acquired?
What is it that's being shown on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel they have to have this facet of manhood?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time: How do we change it?
Because there's definitely something wrong with the young boys.
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any Game of Thrones prequel or sequel when the series finale is scheduled for next summer, all while saying he is fed up with battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a reboot of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best that has come to him Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life going forward", he stated.
Rose played Yggritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV from this cause has dropped to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year by year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Taking into account the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who engage in homosexual relationships will eventually marry a woman.
Many diseases are transmitted through sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data on Republican senators and dismantles "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the demands were driven by critics and far-right websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information leaked online Thursday and was posted by an unknown person at the Capitol during a session of the Senate committee on sexual abuse allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was related to Waters' office and that it revealed information from a member of Waters' staff, Capitol reported.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and a complete lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised due to these false and fraudulent reports, was not responsible in any way for this leak.
This baseless allegation is completely false and a pure fabrication".
Waters' statement prompted online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation", wrote Fleischer.
"That makes you think you don't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not get angry.
It doesn't have to look challenging.
You must not question the prosecution's motives.
You have to stay calm and serene".
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to overthrow Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It matters if it's true", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces to these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for all the actions they have taken that have harmed each and every member of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again: parody of limited spy by Rowan Atkinson
It is already a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this re-imagining of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous self-satire about how despicable we are will be another opportunity to export the country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English has been able to renew his license for the second time to twist everything.
Obviously, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquid glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who contributes a single note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on the international traveller and mystery Atkinson who portrayed the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, where he was spreading chaos everywhere.
There's one or two good moments on this last trip of JE.
He liked the Johnny English who was climbing a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the sheets of l'hélice were scratching his helmet.
You can see the gift Atkinson has for physical comedy, but the humor seems quite fluid and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission: Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as witty or focused as the silent gags of the Mr. Bean character that Atkinson portrays.
The premise that is repeatedly current now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British super-secret spy web and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the consternation of the service agent, a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and besieged figure, who is already suffering a total collapse from lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this character cast by Teresa-May, but the script doesn't get to that.
His intelligence advisers inform him that as each active spy is put in danger, he will have to recover some of his retirement.
And that includes the mischievous Johnny English, now employed as a professor at some fancy institution, but giving off-the-record classes on how to become an undercover agent, with some good gags, like when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his squire-in-training Bough, a role he reprises for Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat disadvantaged.
So, the Batman and Robin of when things get very ugly at Her Majesty's Secret Service get in action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, portrayed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous insanity: disguised as waiters, set fire to a French fast-food restaurant, wreak havoc by smuggling on board Volta's luxury yacht, and English causes great confusion when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are certainly extracted from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, it all seems like a children's program.
Pretty common stuff.
As with the other Johnny English films, it has not helped to think whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to her talent.
The Labour Party denies that he is devising a plan for the British to have a four-day work week and cover five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week and get paid five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of companies to pass on the savings made with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them one more day of holiday.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would fit with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The change to a four-day workweek is supported by the Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits in with the party's perspective of balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: "A four-day work week is not party policy and the party is not considering it".
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public utility companies.
The shadow minister's plans also imply that water company shareholders may not recover the full investment, as the Labour government could apply "deductions" for perceived offences.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector firms' shares to employees, who expect to pocket annual dividends worth up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy on "60 Minutes" as to whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean it", Kennedy said.
"In the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had done it.
He was firm, determined, and confident".
But Graham's vote seems to be engraved in fire.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would make an explosive accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people I appoint will be able to verify it.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing again".
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York City will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event, featuring an absolutely impressive star-studded program, all of whom are on an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty from the world.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances by the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the global goal of the event to end extreme poverty in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless someone wanted to pay a VIP ticket), attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What successes has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just another case of what we call "clictivism" (people who think it makes the difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, which have helped achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped to spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2,250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least USD 10,000 million has already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that currently protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major commitments include The Power of Nutrition Foundation, an association of UK-based investors and filmmakers, which pledges to "help children grow as much as possible" and promises to send Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on their website that asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It's going to be a long and hard road. Sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will triumph, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will feature Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blockade" to obstruct Russian energy exports.
Washington can, "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, as a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe", he supposedly said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, for the blockade, to prevent their energy from entering the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are effectively the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to take advantage of and replace fuels", he said, while indicating that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump said turned Berlin into Moscow's "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 project, which has cost 11 billion USD and will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110,000 million cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is due to purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industry organization, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to back away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply", declared Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "carefully consider" her candidacy for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "carefully consider" her candidacy for president after the midterm elections.
During a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the government's fracture, for women to hold high office", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will take my candidacy for president seriously.
Warren spoke out about President Donald Trump during the city meeting and claimed that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said, "It's clear we need an FBI investigation before the election".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed he should not run for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" Massachusetts voters have said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll revealed broader support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats who were considered in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes the affected by TEPT Track Palin at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007
Monday night, he was arrested and charged with one count of domestic violence.
"With what my own son has been going through since he came back, I can understand other families who are suffering from the ramifications of PTSD and some of the emotional wounds that our soldiers are returning with", he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following of her son and other war veterans: "They get a little different, they get tough, they get wondering if there's respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the military, have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a plea for domestic violence and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed an amicus curiae brief Friday in Washington to support a political-defying asylum seeker, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the children of the violent gang member" assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from Grace's supporters have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where large numbers of asylum seekers are generated in the U.S., as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine declared Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal laws require that asylum claims be awarded according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued in the report that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide needed jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more desperate.
"The environment is very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calmed her fever-stricken son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings bodies.
There is no drinking water".
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to pick up flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injured, and hospitals, badly hit by the 7.5 magnitude quake, are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has broken his shoulder, are outside the Palu military hospital, as patients are being treated outside due to the repeated heavy shaking.
Tears filled his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
I heard my wife crying for help, and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're all right".
The US ambassador accuses China of harassment with "propaganda ads".
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page ad in an American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed the China Daily supplement to The Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, last Wednesday after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials have explained to Reuters is a new phase of Washington's campaign to step up pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war that has seen tariffs on mutual imports spike.
China's vengeful tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at punishing exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claimed that Beijing had harmed US workers, farmers and businesses.
China Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It's doubling down on harassment by running propaganda ads in our free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the cherished American tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in The Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the kiosk down the street here in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and you will see no real reflection of the disparate opinions Chinese citizens may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China was dodging the offer to publish" his article, but did not name the publication.
Republicans are squeezing women voters out before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
With many leading Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault lawsuits, analysts have warned they will see a negative response, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans have already officially shown they want to move forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone", explained Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that last-minute pressure from Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow or in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
"Democrat enthusiasm and motivation will be off the chart", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site, explained.
"People say they've been high; it's true.
But it could have been more, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters, 18 to 29, who often don't vote until they dislike the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony, where he detailed his claims of sexual assault on the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed for confirmation.
"This has become a real mess for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the board vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it's also how the Republicans have handled this issue and how they've treated it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's star and those who believe in Kavanaugh's testimony, with the balance shifting slightly toward the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe unquestionably or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they believe unquestionably or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or undoubtedly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims filed by Ford and at least one other whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted him while under the influence of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals at a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the emerging company.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data warehouse" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, and they're all available in one browser at a time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is that the company integrates the right resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some in-house developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that no one on his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely wiped out overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission".
In a Saturday post to Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the I GM Victory Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victory Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the British's highest military honour.
His two grandchildren uncovered a memorial plaque at a parade on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under intense fire from cannons and machine guns".
Later he ran towards the line of fire and, with "maximum courage", advanced the line before throwing himself over a cannon with one hand and leaving three members of the detachment stunned.
Lieutenant Colonel was shot down by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a feat that could never be matched, which makes you feel humbled.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a wreath after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of a true hero is shown by the support he will receive from many people.
The MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 saw Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine staying up all night watching Bellator 206 and being denied the most important event.
The San Jose poster contained 13 fights, including six from the main card and were to be shown live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, UK viewers were stunned when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset that they had stayed up all night to watch the fight.
One Twitter follower described the move to cartoons as "a kind of vomit-inducing acupuncture".
"The government's policy says that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they switched to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the rebroadcast.
"Peppa the piggy, yeah".
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they would work on the programme to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on a Sunday morning there and we can't solve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at yours.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not all of them were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government issue.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to do five fights instead of six as we normally do, and we tried to re-show it to the fans, but it just ended.
It's an unfortunate situation".
Desert Island Records: Tom Daley felt inferior about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the world because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete has stated that he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to other people.
He also said that being a father had made it less important to him to win the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular presenter, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway on Laverne's first show, said she felt "less than" the others because "I wasn't socially acceptable as boys and girls".
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been real things that have given me the power and the strength to triumph".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and used his image at last year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion explained that she had fallen in love with a man, the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013, "he caught me by surprise".
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years her senior, but she says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you go through so much when you're young (he competed in his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple had a son in June, whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "their whole perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold", he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't call him Dad, you won't be there to take the front row", he said.
"As I took his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn't until then, that he was dead, that I finally accepted that he wasn't invincible", she said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home at an Olympic Games. There was no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired the choice of her first song (Heather Small's Proud), which she had heard during the preparation for the Olympic Games and which still put on her chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
A worsened Mickelson showed up at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to change his physical condition if he doesn't want to become an unhappy record.
Mickelson, who will be participating in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was introduced by captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Four Sounds Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as it has been for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments divides his time between cheerleading and working on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the peak of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where the long rough tends to punish the deviated shots.
And if his own trajectory isn't daunting enough, Mickelson, in Game 9 on Sunday, will face the defending British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down in the first 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson's game could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He understood his role perfectly for that day, he slapped me on the back and he put his arm around me while he told me I would be ready for the day after", Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He's a hall of fame and he's contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't picture him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained and that's how we thought we should go forward.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else".
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
It may mean the end of a Ryder Cup race that hasn't matched his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, joking, likes to make fun of people and is a great teammate", he explained.
I think the younger players were having fun hanging out with him this week, which was fun to watch.
He brings a lot more to the side of his game.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the advantage may soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable lead on the individual duels of the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough day.
The Danish made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the American team, but in the end they achieved the victory by the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"And you keep remembering that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for a short while", Bjorn said, in the image, after seeing the 2018 team win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, leaving the score at 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History has taught me and every member of the team that it's not over yet.
We have to go to the whole machine tomorrow.
You have to go out and do it right.
This isn't over until the points hit the marker.
We have a goal, to try to win the trophy, and we have to stay focused to do it.
I've said it before, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also keep in mind who our rivals are: the best players in the world.
Delighted with the performance of his players on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush into this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It's great to be with a partner when things are going well, but individual duels put your golfing skills to the test.
That's the message you have to get to the players, bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
At that point, you leave your partner and he has to come out and bring out the best in himself.
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points from four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about the last day's climbs, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing in the Miracle of Medinah that won Europe.
"I remember every word exactly", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, motivated his players before the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want to start off on a good footing, as we saw in Brookline and Medina.
When you have a team that's inspired, you create a lot of pressure in these central duels.
We've prepared the lineup according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the rematch against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this order because I think it covers all the possibilities", says Bjorn about his selection for the individual matches.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but will not be until at least next year due to faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but post-construction problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Navy commissioned in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a suite of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technology such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continuing delays imply that the forward-thinking ships, which were predicted to project Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they go into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 was already in the news last year, when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details of the reasons for its return are known, but German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that rendered it unusable if used in combat missions.
The technical problems are significant, as approximately 120 sailors, half the crew required for the old Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, the ship's weight has been found to be excessive, reducing performance and limiting the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is expected to weigh twice as much as similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Aside from the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, is also starting to pose a problem.
It is thought to have reached a staggering $3.6 billion from an initial budget of $2.3 billion.
The problems of new frigates have become a matter of special importance, if recent warnings are taken into account indicating that Germany's maritime military power is being weakened.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defense committee, has acknowledged that the German Navy is running out of ships that can be used.
The official has claimed that the situation has worsened over time because the old ships were no longer used, but no new ones were provided as replacements.
She regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret lives of bats
A new study on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed.
It is hoped that the findings may provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will continue soprano and common bats, as well as northern eared bats and water bats at the Inverewe Botanic Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the property to track the activities of the bats during the season.
Volunteers and staff from the UK National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
Sound analysis of the recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the bats' sounds and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a habitat map will be created to create a detailed, landscape-scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at the National Trust for Scotland, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, and how to improve forest maintenance for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the rest of the UK has declined considerably over the last century.
Building and restoration tasks threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do fly-paper and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of echo-location to locate insects and obstacles that interfere with their flight.
The National Trust for Scotland, responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten experts with adequate training, who conduct surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, rescues on a routine basis.
In fact, the organisation has created Scotland's first and only bat reserve at Threave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The farm's administrator, David Thompson, claims that it is the ideal territory for the species.
"Here in Threave, we have a large bat area", he says.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitats.
But we still don't know a lot about bats, so the work we're doing here and at other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.
It points out the importance of checking for bats before doing maintenance work on property, as the possible unintentional destruction of a single mothering nest may kill more than 400 females and juveniles, which could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, attack, harass, and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Bat Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to step up and help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn from bats, and for some of our species, we don't have enough data on their populations".
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the rape allegations against him are "fake news" and has stated that people "want to become famous" thanks to his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the accusations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid $375,000 in due course to keep the incident from becoming public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, claimed they were "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I was just like,
What they said today, fake news, is what the five-time winner of the Golden Ball says on camera.
They want to make themselves famous because of my name.
It's all right.
They want to use my name to make themselves famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything is in order", the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have qualified as "unacceptable information of suspicious privacy", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz has stated that the player will seek compensation for moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the infraction, which is probably one of the most flagrant personal rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to reports filed in the Clark County, Nevada District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that he was a 99% good guy, except for a 1%.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that both had sexual relations, but they were consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed of her injuries in the hospital, but later accepted an out-of-court settlement because she was fearful of reprisals and worried about being publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old woman claims she is seeking to cancel the agreement, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer has signed for Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "always regret" losing its status as the world's leading manufacturer after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, the Economic Affairs Secretary.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota's UK base had told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without an agreement, it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, production at our factory will stop", said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU will work has raised fears from other UK carmakers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims that it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is made on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the European Union for automotive manufacturing.
If the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, there could be riots at the border, which the sector believes could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production would have to be halted as a result.
Clark claims Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border checks".
"We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the success we have but also to take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Tests not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains".
Toyota could not confirm for how long production would stop, but, in the long term, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite the Union coordinator at the plant, said members are starting to be very concerned about the situation: By experience, when they lose these jobs, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again.
Donald Trump's long-awaited meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed" by a week as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Russia and aid to Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general and jeopardizes Mueller's independence has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump has stated that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI's allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied the following: No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be that it will be delayed another week for all matters with the supreme court.
I always like to keep the press informed.
Some journalists might dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House briefing since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the lack of news sessions was not because he disliked the boasting of television journalists, although he said: "I will not deny that they are boasting".
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is doing more Q&A sessions than any previous president", he said, before adding the following without citing any sources: "We've consulted this data".
Sanders has stated that the briefings will continue to take place, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and they'll replace briefings when you get to talk to the president of the United States.
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal and sometimes bizarre appearance, he is in front of the assembled press.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at Scottish National Health Service amid fears over Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of residence status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the withdrawal have continued, and everything seems to be heading towards the decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also begun preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know these are turbulent times for all of you.
So I would like to reiterate that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, while benefiting patients and the communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury Saturday in the 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed has told the press that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"It came to the sideline and crashed there", Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him on a stretcher and taking him away for further testing.
A Tennessee State official has informed Chris Harris of WSMV of Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been discharged from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's Abercrombie's first season, second year, with Tennessee State after signing from Illinois.
He had completed five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty on buying property in the UK with the extra money used to help the homeless under the new Conservative Party plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Hisenda hopes to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are expected to be charged a higher stamp duty on property purchases in the UK and this money will be used to help the homeless, a measure Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises of providing more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The stamp duty increase will be levied on those individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will go towards government action to combat homelessness.
The overcharge, which will be added to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and real estate speculation, could be as high as 3%.
Hisenda expects to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are owned by non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to break into the property ladder.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people get their first home.
He accused big construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on affordable housing to correct Britain's "housing disaster".
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed housing reforms, such as rent controls and the ending of no-fault foreclosures.
He also wants to give more power to the town halls to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and make a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is just as easy for people who do not live in the UK, as for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too distant and the indignity of the homeless makes it all the more real.
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to coach Scotland".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his ultimate ambition is to be Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot has accepted the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently in third place in League One, three points behind the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was called in once as a support and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland play in Hampden with my dad when I was little and it's always something that takes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in coaching clubs, but.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic claims he does not feel the pressure of being the next in a long list of names to be enshrined in such a big team, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Right now, my criterion for measuring my success is if I can get this team back into the Premier League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is obvious that its place is the Premier League, he has affirmed.
It's not easy to get there, but I would only consider myself successful here if I can bring the club back.
Ross has just three years of coaching experience, after a spell as second-row coach at Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts' technical body.
He helped Alloa avoid relegation to the third tier and transformed St Mirren from fighting for salvation to Championship champions the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his time as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Probably it was a decisive moment", he recalled about accepting the position at Alloa.
I always thought that training was the best thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I did it right, I got out of it reasonably and I enjoyed some pretty good light moments.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot you have to get over every week.
I still go through things like the stress and the pressure of the job, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train, and now that I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've felt since I've been an adult.
The full interview can be heard on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland, between 12:00 and 13:00 UK time.
The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heat wave has boosted consumption in Britain's struggling bars, but added more pressure on restaurant chains.
Bars and chain bars have seen a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has fallen by 4.8%, statistics show.
Peter Martin, of financial adviser CGA, the company that collected the data, states the following: The continued hours of sunshine and England's participation in the World Cup, which has been longer than expected, have caused July to follow a similar pattern to June, with the increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption in restaurants in June has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by beverage consumption, have had the best results, while consumption in restaurants has gone down.
Food bars have also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurants.
It seems people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we've consulted, beverage sales have increased by 6.6% over the month, while food sales have fallen by 3%.
Paul Newman, of the leisure and hotel analysts RSM, has stated the following: These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to sales of the outdoor leisure market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a 4.8% year-on-year decline in sales would be especially damaging, more so than the continued cost pressure.
This long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the shops that serve food and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide this much needed breath.
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, has been 2.7% in July, indicating a slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of over £9 million and is the established benchmark for the sector.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in fake Instagram pages
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a "main" account that they show to their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students say they have a net principal account that they show to their parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager urging others to "rape me".
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Headmasters' Committee (HMC), has revealed that 40% of teenagers aged 11-18 have two profiles, half of whom have admitted to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan stated the following: "It is disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation's board at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from his extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh has the respect of the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the board", Beattie said.
Doyle has stated the following: "I am very keen to act as the voice of the athletes and hope to be able to grow the sport and contribute to it in Scotland".
The American, who won gold in the 200 and 400 at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic golds and is currently a regular commentator for the BBC, was prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I can recover or to what extent.
It's been exhausting, but I've made a full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and today we're doing some agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!
A ticker-tape ad comparing mothers to cows divides the Internet
A company that sells baby clothes has divided the Internet with an ad comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered the world's first portable silent carrier, consumer technology company Elvie has issued an ad inspired by a joke music video to show the freedom that the new carrier gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of cow and pigs to the beat of a song that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I'm going to kill myself, but you won't see any of it" and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not pigs, it's my tits".
The show goes on: "Bomb, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, munyo the girls".
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom claim it shows the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after giving birth", one person wrote.
The Elvie puppy is discreetly hidden in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: Understandably traumatic for mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a trailer for mothers who will keep their babies?
Another user added: "It's an out of place ad".
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song "funny".
I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Pumping for the trailer made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a bit crazy, but it has to be taken for what it is.
It's a great product", one user wrote.
Another person commented: It's a funny ad aimed at mothers who are pumping with zippers (usually at their workplace or in the bathroom and feel like cows.
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the shoulder strap discreetly attached to the braces.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when they use the shower curtain.
However, the Elvie is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, giving women more freedom to move, hold babies and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and early childhood developer of Mother, has stated the following: The Elvie tire is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
By drawing the parallel between women and cows, we wanted to show the audience how to use a sling and the challenges involved in doing so, while at the same time demonstrating, in an entertaining and educational way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new sling offers.
This isn't the first time the Elvie scarecrow has been in the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children, quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children held has increased even though monthly entries across the border have remained virtually stable, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who have been afraid to risk their chance of staying in the country if they decide to take in a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults living in their homes would have to send in digital fingerprints, which would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to take in unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
About 80% of people who have taken in or live in the home of a person who has taken in are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to pursue these people", Albence declared.
To process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to appear in court within a month of being held, instead of the previous standard 60 days, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear via video conference, rather than in person, to defend their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not deemed fit for assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent rampages or attempted escape, according to the workers and reports the system has released in recent months.
Lawyers say that these concerns may intensify in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child's suffering are more likely to be ignored because of their size.
They added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause them the trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges the US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country now lasting eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, has claimed that foreign forces were in Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the "war on terror" is practically over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has displaced millions.
He has stated that Damascus will continue to fight this holy battle until we have purged all Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and of any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has stated that conditions were good for their return and has blamed some Western countries for spreading irrational pores that make refugees want to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They're politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats have claimed that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue political meetings.
The Russia-Turkey agreement has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem has noted that the agreement has clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action will confront the jihadists, which include fighters from the Al-Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who will be "eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a UN envoy, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to begin shaping a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, the scandals and impeachment process end his presidency prematurely.
What would, without a doubt, be the end of one of the most dramatic presidencies in history.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, peak viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has led cable television viewership with as many as 3.5 million viewers on prime-time news nights.
"People have been thrown into it because they don't understand", says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told him he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
He said it was because it made him laugh, he told me Scovell.
There's an entertaining point in chaos.
Of course, unlike the TV shows, the script coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will be reunited and the state of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is about going beyond that when you're in the sixth hour watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of private-use resources for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket, and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' gruesome descriptions of, shall we say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I'll never see Super Mario the same again.
"Part of what makes it feel like I'm part of a reality TV show is that every night gives you something new", says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the character changes and script twists of Trump's show (fighting with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, it was about 25 degrees and he was alone outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, but he was locked up watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
You couldn't get it off, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing those crazy shows back then and people were saying it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it seems they were right.

External money floods the midterm elections races in the tightest House of Representatives
It's no surprise that there's a flood of cash in Pennsylvania's 17th district, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has forced two incumbents to compete for the same seat.
This recent reassignment of the Pittsburgh suburban district involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won the seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another incumbent representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which conflicts with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial war between the parties' main financial organizations, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a long-running special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have held office for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China, but withdraws them
Diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pulled out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received in 2017 a US aid of 140 million dollars, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements, was contemplated.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high death tolls from murder and unemployment.
With the passage of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to take place, effectively ending any chance of sanction for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration places on it, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys returned discreetly to their posts in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton's White House declined to comment on details of the debate described by the three officials, which include two diplomats, who agreed to debate the internal deliberations from the anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from anonymity, corroborated the statements.
He studies history
The next event that could occur would be the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is ample evidence in public records.
As far as we know, Mueller is also investigating whether the Trump campaign collaborated with Russia in their election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself accountable to the body, just as he prepares to do so before voters, and even a jury of party members.
There are many circumstances, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to stage a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the chance to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates on turning points like this and accelerates or slows the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing several tipping points right now.
What if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a tailspin since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein claims that the Times' information is inaccurate.
What do we do if the new investigation the FBI has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, specifically, will we vote in the middle of the legislature for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, democracy will begin to run into danger.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because I learned my lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to light Sabbath candles on that swastika table.
With this baggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorrans, Rangers, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, aware that a win against the Austrians, after an impressive draw on the field of Vila-real this month, would leave them in a good position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first few minutes of the season until the 2-2 draw against Vila-real, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because Vila-real is a good team", the 31-year-old said.
We went into the game thinking we could get a valuable result and came away with a point.
Maybe we could have taken a little bit more at the end, but, overall, probably the fourth was a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it's another big night in Europe.
We hope we can keep the three points, but it will be a difficult match because they got a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we will give everything and get a good result with the support of the fans.
Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying it, the training is good.
I hope we can give it our all, put the past behind us and succeed.
Women lose sleep over the fear of retirement savings
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few of them talked about it with their family.
About half of those surveyed nationwide say they have talked to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of those surveyed say they have spoken to their children about it.
"People want someone in their family to take care of them, but they don't dare ask", said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance company.
We'll start here.
You cannot prepare your family for caregiving if you do not communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your counsellor and your family to decide where and how to get care, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Involve your financial adviser in the conversation - he or she can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your options for financing your long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-based hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your expenses, or self-insurance from your own resources, if you have the money to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the way to legal battles.
Find a representative so that you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notary for your finances.
It is advisable to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid in the event of incapacity.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly relative has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finances are not the only factor that is determined, but also which doctors you want to be treated with", Martin said.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have that plan ready".
Man shot multiple times with a compressed air shotgun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times by a compressed air shotgun as he was returning home after a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which occurred around 2.30am (UK time), as a "random act".
The victim hasn't seen his attacker.
His life is not in danger from his injuries and the police have issued a call for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities.
As communications are cut off, relief units have been unable to obtain information from Donggala Regency, an area in northern Palu near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
The following includes some important data about Palu and Donggala, on Celebes Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Cèlebes Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Cèlebes island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region lower than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Celebes Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the coast at the other end of Cèlebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996 a tsunami also occurred in western Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and earthquakes occur with some frequency.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Ace province, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that devastated the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook an area in the southern part of Padang city, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake shook one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake hit Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic as the population recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapsing buildings.
2018: A series of large earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she pulled out her phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Provisional Detention Center, where he is being held on a non-custodial bond of 500 USD, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he pleaded "not guilty, with certainty" when asked how he pleaded, according to the network.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could face up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to notify the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the reporting of a domestic violence offense, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His partner testified that he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups for associating her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake rocked the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The quake struck just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos of the moment of impact are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in Palu City when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking an extraordinary death sentence for a suspect in the New York terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary sentence that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and hit pedestrians and cyclists along the way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and that he "intentionally" caused serious personal injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both offenses could carry a death sentence, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury attacked Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in mafia cases, plus one count of violent and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors claimed that the attack required "considerable planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's manner of acting as "inhumane, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal New York case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
The police explained that he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to police, he also asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of failing to file a complaint.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a guilty plea and life in prison without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader has claimed that politicians must "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own MPs has suggested that she should lead negotiations with the EU.
Non-executive Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when the pro-union Conservatives have come forward in another anti-Brexit protest in The City.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan amidst attacks from Brexiters, unionists and the EU.
Allies insist he will reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative responses and pressure Eurosceptics and the Conservative Party to choose between his package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to undo the Chequers commitment.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been appointed to the House of Lords and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be out by now,' he said.
Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to undo the Chequers commitment".
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country".
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British population has changed their minds and wants to stay is totally false".
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: "I'm just telling you, Prime Minister, listen to the people".
"The Chequers pledge is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out on the street and get us to win an election.
Drop the Chequers commitment and start listening".
In a message to Mrs May, he added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage said that the rally's politicians must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class", he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them we will not allow it".
In a message to the excited crowd, he added: "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure".
"We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country who gave us the victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, union supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved banners at the anti-Brexit Conservatives after the group's launch this weekend.
Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with a party app at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can have the IT systems that are needed and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for the frictionless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
"It is a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit", he added.
Warren plans to consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been the center of speculation about the possibility of relieving Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents in the open meeting format since Trump took office.
An aide asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in the top".
One person arrested for the shooting death of Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge, La., police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the ET news conference at 11:00.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and ultimately killed", police officer Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-3 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after team orders hand him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas got ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play a big role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel boxed earlier and let Hamilton run with traffic at the back of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop at the pits and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheel-to-wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to leave the free interior with the risk of being left out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap was in seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good position for much of the race as he kept his wheels to save time, advancing Kimi Raikkonen to fourth position.
He finally entered the pits on lap 44, but could not increase the pace on the next eight laps and Raikkonen placed fourth.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who was told to let me through.
The team has done a fantastic job of having a U-two", said Hamilton.
Her body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are "evil, cruel, and liars".
"Something that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's been happening these last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people angry, mean, cruel and lying", he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and you say, 'No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Do you remember his answer -- did you leak the document?
No, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't filter it".
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... No, we didn't filter it", he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's statements against Kavanaugh in July and leaked it in September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein explained to the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, just as he asked".
But his denial didn't sit well with the president, who commented at the Saturday night rally: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the statements for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the evil, the cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overtake to have power and control", the President said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite defeat to Belfast Giants as they won the replay 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained a two-goal lead thanks to the finishes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised their team's level, but Dwyer later restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised Dundee, and then two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from an assist by Kendall McFaull.[4] Four minutes later, with the assistance of David Rutherford, Beauvillier doubled his lead.
During this hectic initial period, Sullivan re-placed the home team in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt equalized at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first half when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to their level with a powerful goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the match at the end of the second half and secured their team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after dying to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake rocked the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There are many aftershocks in the area and there are many people trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his comrades escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat in the shaky control tower of Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in his seat to ensure that Batik Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then, he got out of the air traffic control tower when he thought it was going down.
He later died in hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australia's ABC News.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It broke our hearts", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that have not been accessed", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, rising to six meters, have devastated Palu, which will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance is carrying bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the mini-markets have been looted".
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working around the clock to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
This is a tragedy, but it could get worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man has gone missing after the lagoon crash
The airline that operated a flight that was going to crash into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, although it previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, since Saturday afternoon, they had not found a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Islands Airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that all were in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane was docked at the lagoon because the runway was cut short.
Some witnesses believe the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was going very low.
"That was extremely positive", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk with water on their waist to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to improve a pier also assisted in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people to shore before the plane sank about 100 feet (30 m) underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution will conclude the case on Saturday in a review of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to construct the movements of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted her earlier statements, as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed to have been in Sanford's van that night, Sanford said he had lied, since his van was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that she had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Phone records indicated that they'd only known each other a week.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to pass to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
The High Breed, of Bristol, assures that hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and bring conscious hip-hop back into fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK from the hand of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY City maid sues a couple for firing after a "racist" message
A New York City kindergartener has sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from her mother protesting that she was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist and liken the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed dismay to see that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived to work on her first day in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOO Another Black Person", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Madame Maurice, twice.
After finding out about her pimping, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nanny she had fired, who was African American, had done her job poorly and that she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received her day's pay and was then sent home in an Uber.
Now, Maurice claims compensation from the couple for the dismissal and claims compensation of, approximately, $350 per day for the six-month residency job for which she was hired, even though there was no contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do things like that", he explained to the Post on Friday, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple have responded to the statements that they are racist all claiming that Maurice's firing was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they could not trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent you something she didn't want to say.
It's not racist.
We're not racist people", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been angry with, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on, you know".
Plasco, who has likened the lawsuit to "extortion", said his wife had two months to have a baby and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going after something like this?
It's not a very nice attitude", the investment banker added.
The legal case is still unresolved and the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social media and to condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success".
He explained that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little teddy bear, was optimistic about the book's rejection. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "bitter sweet", after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and says that his father was very proud of him, of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a conceited one", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your son accomplishes something: you are proud, even if it's not your own doing.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
"Though it was his own creation and his own imagination, "he always acknowledged Paddington's own merit".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, they rushed their daughter to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors worked tirelessly to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that she was very sorry and that they did not expect her to get over it", commented Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad and she told me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs that had been given to keep his body beating were being consumed and were being flushed out of his system.
He died before he was scheduled to, and that turned everything off.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and more people.
I had to keep up the good manners".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience she was experiencing.
"No one knew", he said.
"I was downcast and tears would not stop falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
The feeling that I needed my love and my understanding.
I know how much you wanted her".
Women of sorrow pengen cards to prevent suicides at a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging signs on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and, at age 18, committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, a resident of Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile could light up any room".
However, he quit his job before he died because he was in a "very dark spot".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis stated: "I am continually concerned that there may be a side effect".
Mrs. Davis created the cards "so people know there are people they can turn to, who can listen, even if it's a friend.
Do not keep silent; you must speak".
Mrs Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of Mark's mother.
"He never said that he was unwell or that he was depressed or anything like that", she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change in attitude.
He was deeply moved on Christmas Day when the children opened their presents and he didn't look them in the eye or anything".
She said that her death was a great trauma for them, but they had to work it out: "It opens a hole in the family.
It destroys us.
But we have to keep fighting".

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins an investigation
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be destroyed by the rooted deadlock of supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is about the moment.
With only five weeks left until the November 6 midterm elections, if, as expected, the Republicans don't get a good result, they'll be weak in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as she was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI believes your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where, at present, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to uncouple the fourth and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors "drops" with Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the rising prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Normally, the vast majority of North Korean defectors are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul sources claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal defectors, rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "hysterical" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is a "historian" and that his temperament makes him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if a woman had acted this way, she would have been called a 'historian,'" Pelosi said in reference to her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes screaming and speechless as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats and said the charges against him amounted to a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, as it showed his prejudice against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if she would try to contest Kavanaugh's election, if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats win a majority in the House.
"Here's what I can say: If you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only are you not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, but you're not qualified to be on the court you're on now", Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she considers herself a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he dodged questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Superior Court.
"This is no time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to walk into this courtroom and expect us to look wonderful", Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It's a justified diatribe: months and years of abundant rage and he can't take it off without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon. How about you?"
She went on to say, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a tactic where, when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm upset about it".
And then he would go on.
I thought it was brilliant".
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they're basically misinterpreted.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once ended up crying with indescribable rage, is of an older woman (a cold boss who had always been a little bit terrifying to me) who grabbed me by the collar and dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be happy, because they'll have you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from racing, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of running herself as a presidential candidate.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone said "Whitey and the Seven Dwarfs".
As she was late to the campaign, she was behind on fundraising, so she promised that she would not enter the race unless she raised 2 million USD.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, were only willing to give $250 to her.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he would ask.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions -- gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and for targeting voters, instead of delegates, and anger, and sexism -- that she was speechless.
"You might have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", recalled Mrs. Schroeder of the press reaction.
"You might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking, "What are they going to put on my grave?"
"Did she cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war may benefit Beijing
The initial savings from the US-China trade war were deafening, and while it doesn't look like the war will end anytime soon, a distance between the countries could prove beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year, when he imposed tariffs on China's main exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week, with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of products, and these tariffs mean a tax on half of all goods coming into the United States from China.
Beijing has counterattacked each time in the same way and recently raised tariffs from five to 10 percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has committed to replicating the United States, and it's not likely that the world's second largest economy will be back in the near future.
Making Washington back down means giving in to some demands, but bowing down publicly to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that initiate a downfall in either of these countries is far more dangerous than the witnesses had predicted", says Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country, devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on the streets is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normalcy.
All conditions are met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their maintenance.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that financed the insurgency.
Europe's national team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight times on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team won the crown again when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought through most of the tournament, threw the exit shot into the water at the par 3 16 hole, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his series and became one of only four players to achieve 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was sent off with a 5&4 by the less qualified European team player Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The most qualified player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain became the tournament's all-time leading scorer with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a very tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the cup back.
The team is the most important... and I'm happy to have been able to help", commented an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golfing legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players ever, with 14 major titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
There was a moment this morning when we pressed the European selection.
We fought.
I'm getting my dick out for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Your 12 players have played very well.
We're gonna regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and make progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
It's for getting your dick out.
They've defeated us".
