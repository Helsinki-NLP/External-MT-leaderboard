Report on All the Cuts (CanCam.jp ) - Yahoo! News
Adding Layers to Weighted Semi-Longs to Genuine Winds
The CanCam model is like, "It is beautiful, but of course, professionalism is very high and I respect it!""I challenge the hairstyle with movement like Minoru Tanaka.
In fact, I asked Mr. Akira Asahi of Omotesando’s hair salon “SUNVALLY”, who is working on the haircut of Minoru Tanaka, to make it “everyone’s real hair”.
Report that cut process!
Tochigizaka 46 Mitsuki Yamashita, the first cover to become short hair!
First, check the hair in front of the cut.
It's thin, soft, and bulky.
There is a habit, especially when it rains in the rainy season, so you can put on a straight perm.
It is a heavy semi-long with a flowing front hair.
The cut is finally starting!
To make it easier to cut, lightly wet the whole thing first.
After that, it separates the top of the bee (the part above the outermost part of the head) and cuts it from the bottom.
By the way, here is the point of the hair that everyone gets close to the real one!
1 By shortening the inside of the front hair a little bit, you can enjoy the change depending on the styling, such as a slightly thicker if you lower it completely, and a see-through that the skin is cleared if you divide it lightly.
2 Cuts that make use of scissors If the hairy scissors reduce the amount of hair too much, it can spread well.
While consulting the balance around it, it is easy to handle but difficult to spread, keeping the balance so that your own swelling will live.
3 Layer around the face and hair cut with layer = step.
If you put a layer around your face, it will be easy to move, making it a cute finish.
If you make the hair in three places in front and back of the eyebrows, it will look fashionable even when you put it together and make it into hair.
If you cut the hair on the bee that you have separated together, it will be around your face.
Pull the hair bouquet in front of the upper part of the face and cut the hair tip a little.
This way, when the hair bouquet is lowered, there is a step difference, which makes it easier to move (this is layer cut ).

Sankei Sports: Yahoo! News: Governor Yoshimura will partner with Gurunabi on COVID-19

In Osaka Prefecture, from the beginning of this month, in order to promote efforts to prevent the spread of infection and provide peace of mind to the residents of the prefecture, the "Declaration of Infectious Disease Prevention" has been issued to businesses that comply with the guidelines.
However, there are only 11,000 stickers issued in the prefecture, which is said to be more than 120,000 restaurants alone.
So Governor Yoshimura said, "I'm thinking about doing it at the end of the month, but when I make a reservation, I'm going to partner with something like "Gurunamibi," and when I make a reservation, I'm going to put out a declarative sticker issuer so that I can understand it at the booking stage," and declared the tag with the Internet reservation site.
What's important is not to put it all together with 'the city of the night'; it should be clearly divided between the stores that are doing anti-infectious diseases and the stores that are not doing it. It's also important to make efforts to increase the number of shops that are doing it."

Butler re-applauds Tyler Hero, a young man who is responsible for the future of heat: "Thinking isn't Lucky's" ( Basket Count) - Yahoo!
Photo = Getty Images The first game of the scrimmage of heat (practice game) is a match with Kings.
In the 104–98 game, Duncan Robinson scored 18 goals for Team High, followed by Tyler Hero, who scored 15 points and played backcoat.
Robinson, the league's leading shooter, as well as the 13th overall draft rookie and hero step-up, are key factors for Heat.
The hero missed 15 games from February to March due to an ankle injury, and the season entered a long interruption after the return match against Hornets on March 12.
The hero said, “I’ve had a lot of time, so I’ve been able to get back 100% of the conditions. It’s the best I’ve ever felt,” but the performance in the scrimmage was more convincing than words.
Due to the delay of Kendrick Nan, the first point guard, the hero's play time increased, making use of that opportunity.
It also has a different role than usual, and it has a great value because it scored 15 points after doing it brilliantly.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised the hero of "Favorites".
"He's a handler, he's a scorer, he's a defender. He's a player who can do everything for the team. He can do any position because he doesn't have a rookie in his mind. He's looking at the video and researching it, where his teammates are moving and how they're going to be free, and he's trying to figure out what to do about it."
Before the start of the season, Butler liked the unbelievable strength of the hero Luke and the stoic attitude of working on basketball.
That's why I invited them to practice at 4:00 in the morning and have been training with them.
Butler once said, "He says his opinion to everyone, and he doesn't pull him down. He can respect those wills."
The Butler is the type to say what he thinks, and when he thinks it will help the team, he knows that there will be a collision, and he claps hard.
This has also led to a worse relationship with teammates in the past.
Butler must have been a young hero.
Butler’s character, which is sometimes too intense for his teammates, is a good guide for those who have enough guts to come about it.
If the two mutually respected disciples ripple across the team, Heat could become a better team.
Shimasho's initiative in the first round of the 4th round of the 2020 Summer Shizuoka High School Baseball Games: Shimada Sho-Hamamatsujo Kitako|Shizuoka Shimbun At Es
Shimada-sho: Hokuko HAMAMATSU-JO Castle, once-backed Shimada-sho (traditional Shimada-sho) is immortalized, and Matsuura hits a preemptive hit - Kusanagi Stadium
4th round (the first game of Kusanagi): 0000000 - 0 410000 x 5 Shimada Sho, 1 hour and 26 minutes
Criticism: SHIMADA SHO made the opportunity in the beginning and won the full victory over Hamamatsu-jo Castle Hokuko.
Shimada-sho took the lead in the first two-point timely hit of Matsuura with the first undead Manchuria.
I added two more points with Goro UCHINO and Squid.
After throwing, Saito, who had started six times, showed a good pitch without losing points with only one hit.
Kitako HAMAMATSUJO did not take advantage of the opportunity of the last two deaths.
The fourth round led by three years
2: Matsuura hits the lead in thanksgiving.
The opponent's appearance was the fourth in two years, which was his first appearance this summer.
Matsuura, a merchant of Shimada, hit a change ball at the first time without death and carried it to the front left.
If I lose for three years, I will retire as soon as I can, and I want to win."
Last fall, the miscellaneous material, which was in charge of number four, shook his chest.
The first and third rounds were fought mainly for three years, and the most powerful two-year races were held upside down.
Director Ikeda gathered the players at the meeting, and told Nine, "These three years have been connected. We're going to be the best members in the future."
On this day, four out of the nine stamens solidified their main axis in two years.
It seems to be rude, but it is evidence that he is committed to serious fighting.
Matsuura is confident that the level of the opponent's pitcher will increase from now on, and that he will face the runner with the intention of returning.
Saito, who became a serial pitcher, did not step on even the second base with a good pitch to keep the six hits to one hit, and took a look at his intention for three years.
The number 10 is favorable as a synergistic effect, saying, "After two years, you will be stimulated for three years. If you lead to victory."
For the third consecutive year in a row with the Shizuoka tournament until last year, the team aiming for more than four points will not make the rest of the game a memorable one.
16 musicians related to Fukushima Prefecture gather in the singing world with the prefectural people (Fukushima Folklore) - Yahoo!
We want to deliver the energetic singing voices of Hama, Naka and Aizu to the world.
Sixteen musicians related to Fukushima Prefecture gathered together to make a message song.
After the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Tokyo Electric Power Company's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station accident, he engraved the eclectic figure of Fukushima Prefecture fighting against the novel coronavirus.
By the summer of next year, which is the tenth anniversary of the earthquake, the "complete edition" will be finished by blowing up the singing voice of the prefectural people.
On April 24, the song was released on the video posting site "Youtube".
The song is titled "Pray from Fukushima".
We put a bright and energetic melody with the desire to convey the positive attitude of people from Fukushima.
Because of the coronavirus, the live house, which is home to music activities, has been closed, and many musicians have lost the opportunity to sing and perform.
In order to believe in the power of music, Nappo (46), a singer-songwriter living in Minamisoma City, and DAZU-O (37) of the music group "Mehikari Boys" in Iwaki City were planned.
Nappo is in charge of lyrics and composition, while Dazo is in charge of rap.
When the project started in March, singer-songwriters MANAMI (28) and Jun Sugano (38) from Fukushima City agreed one after another, and the circle spread in an instant.
Nappo says with a senseless face, "I've become a luxurious face that can't be imagined at normal times. I want to enjoy this opportunity to my fullest."
There was no opportunity for 16 people to gather as a countermeasure against infection, and each of them recorded at a live house or at home.
In an attempt to support the project, Iwaki City's painter Koa drew down an image character.
It is surrounded by Fukushima Prefecture and expresses a natural rich climate with blue and green.
The finished song is broadcast to the world through YouTube, and the CD is also aimed at.
The Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics are scheduled to be postponed next year, 10 years after the earthquake.
"There's a lot of things that we're going to do when we're overcoming the hardships, and I'd be happy if we could encourage a lot of people to release songs on a milestone," said Dazo.
Other participating musicians are as follows.

JBpress Confirms Sudden Crisis in Internet Information (Yahoo! News)
i want to know where and what kind of disasters and accidents happened!
This is not limited to news organizations such as TV and newspapers, but there is a strong need for social infrastructure companies and municipalities as well.
The corresponding service is “Specty” developed by Spectee, an AI-based information analysis company.
Photo: Specty alerts let professional teams determine whether social media information is true or not
Now, the first way people know about disasters and accidents is moving from TV to online information (social media).
Social media, such as Twitter, has become an important medium that sends information immediately after a disaster or accident.
However, it’s hard to keep an eye on the overflowing information and extract useful information from it.
The service detects natural disasters and accidents from information flowing through social media such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, analyzes the content, determines the truth of the information, and then distributes it to the company.
It is a crisis management support service that visualizes various kinds of crisis occurring in Japan and overseas by positioning negative impact events such as stopping and stagnating social activities as "crisis" widely (CEO Kenjiro Murakami).
The NHK at the time of the Kumamoto earthquake in April 2016 was the first major use case of Specty, and the adoption movement spread rapidly among companies after that.
In addition to news outlets such as TV stations and newspaper companies, more than 350 companies in Japan, including companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, and municipalities all over the country, are currently using Specti.
■Analyzing Posts to Determine the Types and Places of Crisis
Specty delivers information in four steps: "collection of information", "analysis and content classification", "title addition", and "true judgment".
Companies are required to specify areas where information is collected (such as prefectures, municipalities, etc. )and categories of crisis (such as disasters and accidents).
Specty collects posts that fall under that designation using an API provided by social media.
It then analyzes and categorizes the text, images, and videos contained in the posts it collects.
For example, if there is a video showing a firetruck, a black smoke from the building, and an orange flame from the room, it will be classified as a "fire".
In addition, the image of the overturned car is classified as "traffic accident ", and the image of the road covered with water is classified as "road crown water".
Specty also estimates where disasters and accidents occur.
We often don’t know where the posts are, so we use a combination of different information to estimate them,” says Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or sign is reflected in an image or video, the location name information is extracted from the image, and the location is identified by collation with the place name database.

i don't know what it's like to be in the house...?
I asked people in Chiba Prefecture "I thought it wasn't really a dialect" (Netorabo ) - Yahoo!
It is a citizen of Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo.
I have lived in the prefecture for less than 30 years since I was born.
When I used the word "zuru mixed" for a conversation with a friend of mine at a university (Tokyo), it was called "Kyoton" for a moment.
I was able to understand the meaning by the flow and the sense of language, but I was told by the people of Tokyo and Saitama that I would not use it.
-- I'm sure, "Do you think you're going to get upside down?"
It seems that the meaning can be guessed somehow because it seems to be connected with.
And one more thing.
It is not noticeable that this was pointed out, but the expression "uchinchi" which means "my house" was not used at all even if I read a book, and it was a dialect when I looked into it after becoming an adult that I did not hear from a friend.
-- well, "I'm home." ... was that so?
I also used it in my local (Gunma Prefecture), but I did not realize that it was because I stopped using it naturally after I became an adult ....
■"Cold China" in Japan is not a Chinese Uke...?
■"Cold Noodle Cuisine" Unpopular (Contemporary Business ) - Yahoo! News
■China's Cooled Noodles Are 'Nichi-style Cold Noodles'
As mentioned at the beginning, chilled Chinese is a Chinese dish (daily Chinese) originated in Japan that was devised based on the "cold-mixed surface" of China.
Therefore, although it originally did not exist in China, due to the diversification of food, it began to be seen in Japanese restaurants in summer.
Recently, in Japanese convenience stores, an arrangement called "Nichishiki Soba Cool Face / Soba Cooled Yashi Chugoku" and "Kawaka Chicken Cool Face / Sichuan Wind Chicken Cooled Yashi Chugoku" have appeared.
On the other hand, the popularity of Japanese-style Chinese cuisine in China is generally not high because it is pressed by popular Chinese dishes such as Sichuan-ryori and Konan-ryori.
Naturally, Japanese Chinese seasonings are often familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, although it is not unpleasant, it tends to be criticized for its lack of impact.
Cooled China is no exception, and it is still a minor presence in China.
By the way, the name of chilled Chinese in China is “Nichi-style cold noodles”.
Chinese people are recognized as one of the Japanese dishes.
The most popular of summers is "Lyanpee."
In China, the noodle dish that feels summer is “lyampee”.
In Japan, there are many people who are not familiar with it, but cool skin is a flat-cut noodles made from flour, rice flour, starch, etc.
It is said that it has a history of 2,000 years.
It is a standard B-class gourmet that is also sold in stalls, and the price is very reasonable around 10-20 yuan (150-300 yen).
The word 'ryo' (cool) is included, but like Japan's chilled Chinese, it is not pressed with ice.
Rather, the base temperature is the normal temperature.
On top of the noodles, toppings of favorite ingredients such as chopped cucumbers, carrots and boiled pears are added to the noodles, and the seasonings such as pakuchi, chili pepper, ginger, and garlic are added.
Finally, it is finished with a special seasoning mixed with soy sauce, larry oil, vinegar, sesame paste, peanut paste, etc.
The sour and thick spicy sauce is often entangled in the noodles that are well over the throat, and even when there is no appetite in the summer, it sludges into the noodles.
In addition, because it penetrates all over China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and there are abundant variations, which is a characteristic of cool skin, and it is one of the ways to enjoy it.

The Benefits of a Cold Water Shower for Your Body and Mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo! News
suppress inflammation such as muscle pain)
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (water treatment) and found that it can be expected to be effective for physical and mental healing.
By bathing in cold water after exercise, muscle pain and other inflammatory effects can be suppressed.
Dr. Douglas Kasa, head of the Korey Stringer Institute for Sports Medicine and a professor at the University of Connecticut, said: “It’s important to do exercise and take a cold shower with as little time as possible. By moving your body and immediately lowering your body temperature, you’ll be able to recover from inflammation and fatigue from exercise faster.”
Reduce fatigue
When you exercise in high temperatures, your heart, muscles, and skin usually require more blood flow.
"When you exercise, your heart rate increases, you have more blood flow into your heart, you need more energy to contract your muscles, and you have more blood flowing through your skin to regulate your body temperature," Kasa said.
"The cold water shower lowers the temperature of the skin, which reduces the amount of blood flow sent to the skin. Instead, it sends blood to the internal organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract, which makes it easier to consume moisture and nutrition even after exercise. As a result, you can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercise."
Expectation of the Holmisis Effect
Dorozevsky also explains that exposure to cold water can be expected to trigger the "Holmysis effect."
The hormicidal effect is the idea that it is better to have only a little more substances and stress that are harmful to the body than not at all.
"The hypoxia, fasting, and cold-water showers are some of the best examples of how you can expect a formalis effect for your health. By doing a cold-water shower, hormones and neurotransmitters are stimulated, and physical and physical toughness and resilience can be enhanced."

I didn't miss ONO's sweet 134-kilometer slider.
The ball caught with the core is the perfect hit to be sure to stand in at the moment of hitting.
One shot of the two games following the match against Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23rd of the previous day was a slapstick of the counterattack.
It was also a valuable one to hit from the opponent who was not good at it.
When he played against ONO no Oto in Koshien on the 17th, he scored 9 hits and 4 points.
However, only the Nagoya Dome allowed seven wins, one loss, and one hold in the past 12 games, and since August 23, 2013, it has been suffering from seven consecutive losses between the draws.
From such a difficult enemy, Nagoya Dome scored 23 innings (also counted as 1 inning in the middle) with a big shot, and did not cross the flow of the game.
Yano also said, "It's a high level to be able to hold down sweet balls firmly. I'm watching them, and they have an atmosphere even when they're hitting fouls. I think they'll still be able to hit them."
At one time, a right forward hit is released, and this marks the six consecutive cheap hits & three consecutive multiple cheap hits.
The opening of the game was a preliminary start, but 7 hits and 16 hits have already been performed as the team's top and 4th best.
In order to win, we will continue to produce results.

Establishment of Masujiro OMURA as the educator to the senshi [Yamaguchi]|Ube Nichiho This Town Media Web
A bronze statue of Masujiro OMURA (1825-69), one of the top ten statues of the Meiji Restoration, was seen in the minting senji in Yamaguchi City, where he was born on the 23rd.
The decommissioning ceremony was held in the front yard of the local exchange center, which was established, and local and administrative officials celebrated the completion.
Masujiro was a military scholar, a Western scholar, and a doctor during the end of the Edo period.
After he became a educator at 'Bansho Shirabesho,' a research and educational institution for Western studies of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), he opened his private school 'Aoido' in Edo and taught Western studies, military science, and medicine.
After returning to the Choshu Domain, he gave lectures on military science at the Yamaguchi Meirinkan.
The bronze statue focused on Masujiro as an educator.
He stood beside the globe, holding a book in his hand, and gave lectures on Dutch studies.
It is said that the height of the statue combined with the pedestal was about 3 meters (images 1 and 55 meters), and it was made from the eyes of disciples who received Masujiro's lecture.
Masujiro's wife, a descendant of Ayako, was in charge of the design by local designer Marie Takatsuki (27).
A 150-year-old business execution committee (President: Toshi Okamoto) called for donations after the death of Masujiro OMURA, who was based in the self-governing society of the mint, built the building.
About 12.8 million yen was collected from 1104 people all over the country.
The business expenses, including the installation of the name board, are approximately 12 million yen.
Additional donations are used for the maintenance and management of bronze statues.
Mr. Okamoto said, "Masujiro, who continued to have high ambitions and made a great contribution as an educator, is proud of Furusato. It is a bronze statue that will be the hope of children in the region who will be responsible for the future."

After the match, Mbape left the stadium with a crutch attached to his right leg.
PSG competes in the Coupe Dow La League Final against Lyon at 4:10 PM ET, but it is definitely impossible to use Embape in the match.
It is necessary to wait for the medical report to be released by the club, but there is a possibility that it will miss the Champions League in Portugal.
An online art museum "HASARD" Mr. Tatsuno (born in Hachinohe) launched (Daily Tohoku Shimbun, Inc. ) - Yahoo!
There is a museum where anyone can touch art for free whenever they want.
They range from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in Japan.
Since its "opening" in April 2019, the online museum "HASARD" has caught the hearts of users from its convenience and newness, and the popularity has increased even more with the opportunity of a new way of life due to the novel coronavirus.
Mr. Shinnosuke Shibano, 26, from Hachino City, Tokyo, who founded the site, said, "I wanted to create a service that everyone can enjoy art easily. I want people to touch art under difficult circumstances. "
What surprises me when I visit Azer is the richness of the exhibition and the beauty of the image.
As of April 24, 14 permanent exhibitions and planned exhibitions have been exhibited, attracting people who see ultra-high-resolution works that convey not only color but also the texture of the brush.
There is no membership registration or admission fee, and not only the viewer but also the artist who wants to hold a solo exhibition is not costly.
The way it looks online is also attracting attention.
One of them is to move the picture.
Claude Monet's permanent exhibition "It begins to move again" is digitally processed to move clouds, flowers, grasslands, etc.
I want people who are less interested in art to be able to come in and enjoy the feeling that they are in the picture.
It was when I was an elementary school student that I met the representative of Sagano and art.
At that time, when I visited the newly completed Aomori Prefectural Museum of Art with my family, I was shocked by the power of the three huge paintings of Marc Chagall's Aleko.
From the next day, the art class changed into a fun time, and even after going to Tokyo with the opportunity to go to university, I began to go to galleries and so on.
At the same time, I felt that there were many people who did not have much opportunity to interact with art from various viewpoints, such as the museum is not close, the big exhibition is held only in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out with childcare.
So, while working at an IT company, I started a site where I could see art on the Internet for about two months.
The average number of users reached 10,000 a month in the first 10 months, up to about 30,000 after the spread of the novel coronavirus.
When anyone wants to see it, they can enjoy the art in a free form.
Ather's aim was accepted by more and more people due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Mr. Tatsuno emphasized the significance of the appreciation of art, and emphasized that it enriches the imagination.
"As our imagination gets richer, we can reach out to people who are in trouble.
I want art to become a better society by becoming familiar with it."
The era of Chinese quality is over, and the era of Japanese quality is coming: a simple reason (modern business ) - Yahoo!
Conversion of Values in the Pandemic
There are plenty of predictions and discussions about the post-pandemic world.
On the business side, on July 8th, the work of 'manager' in Japan is starting to disappear...! Its brutal reality', and on July 4th, there is a possibility that changes mentioned in the world of 'post-coronavirus' may occur, such as 'the manufacturing industry in Japan is likely to resurrect greatly...!'
Photo: Japan's strength, which only Japanese know, is a surprising reality seen in Asia
In addition, mentally, the trend of "Full Combustion Achievement" given to people who have become aware of the end of their lives with the Corona on June 26, and June 10, "Corona, let's reconsider the utility of "God's Reliance in the Distress" which is full of riots" is expected to become mainstream.
And it seems that the two "materials (economics and business)" and "spirit" come to be clearly visible to our eyes as a form of consolidation, "from Chinese quality to Japanese quality" is a big flow.
For example, if there is a defect or defect in a T-shirt or a digital camera, it is angry, but there is no other provision in the life of the person who purchased it.
On the other hand, the recently discussed quality of masks and ventilators made in China ... "China quality" in such products that are directly connected to life and safety is deadly.
No matter how cheap it is, you can't buy such a product.
Even if you pay a considerable price, you will seek "Japanese quality" products.
Of course, this trend is not only happening in Japan.
It is also clear that Europe and the United States, which fell into a difficult situation due to lack of masks and medical equipment, continued to "return" one after another due to the brutality of "China's quality".
■Reliable and Safer Than Cheaper
In addition, products such as automobiles can also be fatal (death caused by accident).
No matter how many countries, such as Central and South Korea, oppose the cheap selling strategy of 'cheap and evil,' they will not be able to beat Japanese products in the end, and the situation as described in the article on June 16, 'Is it true that automobile manufacturers in the world will be encroached on Toyota?' is because 'Japanese quality' is strongly required in the products of automobiles.
And the pandemic reminded me of the need for “safety and security” in many other products.
In addition, security and safety are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing", but also for "Japanese quality in logistics and other services".
Even though the production capacity is good, there are times when intermediate distribution is stagnant and it is not reachable, such as toilet paper riots.
In addition, he felt that self-sufficiency in Japan was an important element of "safety and security", as in the article on April 17, "Who is the real culprit of lack of masks! Don't allow fire thieves in the Chinese Communist Party administration".
Every country has its own priority when it comes to emergency, and it is very important to be able to procure essentials such as masks (medical devices) and food in its own country.

Nagoya-Miyabara Vote for the First Time Since League Reopening | Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan
A positive response to the novel coronavirus has been confirmed by DF's Kazuya Miyahara, 24, in Nagoya on Monday.
This is the first time that a player has responded positively after the J. League reopens.
It is the third player in the club after FW Yumeo Kanazaki (31), who was infected in June, and GK Mitchell Langerack (31), who was born in Australia.
The two had already been treated and returned to the game.
This season, Miyahara entered the bench at the grand division of J1 in Oita, Showa Denko Dome on the 22nd.
Nagoya said Monday that it had conducted a PCR test for 60 athletes and staff on the same day.

White paint derived from teflon-processed frying pan, it turns out that it improves the cooling effect by heat insulation!
Unbelievable discovery!
This year was a rainy season with an unprecedented amount of precipitation, but if it was clear, the summer of intense heat would be full-fledged.
It's hot, it's hot, it's cold, it's ineffective, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot.
Global warming is a global problem, and mankind has focused on how to overcome the hot summer as much as possible.
One way to do this is to wear a thin white garment.
You don't need to wear black clothes that absorb heat in summer, do you?
In addition, the same principle has been applied to house architecture, and the number of cases where white paint is used is increasing.
Even if white is white, it can not be a paint that reflects more light and does not absorb heat, that was the latest research field.
The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, has teamed up with researchers at Columbia University’s Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics to find the most efficient way to regenerate the solar heat to improve the cooling effect inside the building.
It is said that it aims for early practical use.
Until now, white paints with the highest reflectivity of sunlight were made of titanium oxide, which reached a reflectance of 85%.
Already, white paint using titanium oxide is applied to the roof of a building in a high temperature environment, and it is used to block solar heat and increase cooling efficiency.
However, what was newly discovered was a white paint derived from a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fluoropolymer used in those teflon-processed frying pans.
It is a white paint that applies this Teflon effect, and it is said that it is possible to greatly cut heat by reflecting sunlight to nearly 98%.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to a white paint using Teflon unexpectedly, it is easy to spend without exposure to intense heat indoors ~.
Maybe such an era will come soon, isn't it?
I feel that there are many dark colors in the roofs of Japanese houses, but from now on the white system will become mainstream?
When is Amazon's annual big sale going to be held this year?
Amazon.com Inc. announced the postponement of Prime Day, its biggest annual sale, according to CNBC Inc. on July 21.
The event, which is held every July, is said to be postponed this year due to the spread of the novel coronavirus.
In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson said: “We’re going to announce more details soon.
“Prime Day has become a special festive event that we look forward to in the last five years. This year, we’ll hold it later than usual, while ensuring the safety of our employees and helping our customers and sellers.”
However, the details will be announced soon," he said, but did not disclose the specific date of the event.
On the other hand, the event was held in India.
Press release on the site of the country.
It will take place from 0 a. m. to 48 hours on August 6.
Prime Day, which has been held simultaneously around the world, may be taking an unusual step this year.
A big event that sells 76 billion yen in two days Amazon started a big sale for members in 2015 as a way to promote sales in the summer when sales are decreasing.
The event was initially held 24 hours a year, but last year it took place in 18 countries, including the U. S. , Canada, the U. K. , Germany, France, India, Japan, China and Australia, from 0 a. m. to 48 hours a year.
The company said last year its two-day sales surpassed that of Black Friday (the first day of the end of the year) and Cyber Monday (the following Monday).
This event also contributed to the acquisition of new subscribers of the paid membership “Prime”, and last year the number of applications for the first day was the highest number of cases in the past, and the next day there was the number of cases next.
The company also said it sold 175 million products worldwide last year.
Internet retailer Internet Retailer reported that the two-day global total sales jumped 70 percent year-over-year to $7.76 billion ($76 billion).
Hands-on with mobile phone number transfer and excessive locking.
What about fees and points?
(New Switch) - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is considering a review of the MNP, which will allow mobile carriers to use their existing phone numbers as they are.
The guidelines for the MNP, which was established in 2004, will be amended at a meeting of experts on Monday.
Specifically, there are a wide range of issues, such as the MNP fee, and the possibility of keeping it closed for those who wish to leave the country.
In anticipation of backlash from telecommunications companies, it will attract attention whether it will lead to the promotion of healthy market competition.
At the beginning of 06, the user burden fee was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen, when the communication companies introduced dark MNP, which is far from all-you-can-go on mobile phones.
MNP commission revenues for three of the biggest mobile carriers are estimated at $1.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications listed the current status of the MNP at a conference of experts discussing the competitive environment of the telecommunications market, the Working Group on the Verification of Competition Rules (WG).
The time it takes for consumers to receive the MNP reservation number they need to transfer to other telecom companies was also mentioned.
Major telecom companies accept it on the web, but due to the convenience of operating the core system, the reception time is generally 9-20 o'clock.
In the WG document, it is stated that the principle is to respond all day long as the direction of future examination.
For those who wish to move out of the MNP, it is also a problem to try to close it by granting points by a mobile communication company.
It’s because it’s judged that excessive restraints can impede fair competition.
Mr. Shunichi Kita, a partner at the Nomura Research Institute, a member of the WG, said, "It is important to make sure that users have time to explain about the provision of economic benefits, or to obtain permission from users, and to issue and terminate numbers promptly for users who do not have permission. First of all, it is important to thoroughly carry out this process."
However, in a series of arguments, the structure problem of the MNP fee is that "the higher the customer, the harder it will be to leak, the harder it will be to motivate them to actively lower."
If there is a business that leads down the MNP fee, there is also concern that there will be an increase in customer outflow from the company and corporate efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that many countries overseas do not require a user fee for MNP, which could be the case in Japan.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications would like to compile the results of the WG as a report around September-October, and then start the process of revising the MNP guidelines.
The timing of the revision is expected to be 21 years or later.
It’s likely that mobile carriers will be bothered by sales and customer support.
Chunichi, Katsuno, and Six Unsuccessful Points Can't Get Winner Rights (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!
Chunichi and Masayoshi KATSUNO (23) started the 8th round of Hanshin (Nagoya Dome) on the 25th.
Six times four hits were not lost.
"Because there was also a last climbing board, I thought it was a last chance to throw it. There was also a foreball, but I was able to play against the opponent without worrying too much."
This season's first climbing board and the last 18 days of the Battle of Hanshin (Koshien ), the first two times both suffered from baseball and dropped the board by 4 times.
This time it was a mound of backwater that did not play a precursor role and ran on one army's survival.
This time, he bullishly attacked a strong tiger batting line with a warm ball.
When the straight ball in the second half of the 140 km platform ran, the change ball such as the count ball could be used effectively.
Six times, he was hit by the first Sands in the middle of the left, but he flew the Oyama to the left, and took Bohr to the Nigoro, and died two times and three times.
In the match against Fukuru, I caught up with two balls, and in the end it was a fork.
In a three-ball game, he deprived himself of the stray triumph and beat the pinch.
Katsuno finished 83 balls six times, but at the end of the middle game, Yoda came out of the bench and told him to change pitchers.
Saiyu, who played the pitcher's game, had 108 balls at the same time, but left the mound first, and was unable to win his first victory this season.

Akio Kishita, Head of Ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital, Explains Dry Eye in 'Hotto Seminar'
A health seminar (hosted by Saga Shimbun and co-hosted by Jonesawa) was held at the Yonesawa Saga Main Store in Shimoda-cho, Saga City on Wednesday, with expert advice on various health issues.
Mr. Akio Kishita, Director of Ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital (Kogi City), explained eye diseases that are deeply involved in daily life, such as dry eyes and cataracts.
Dry Eye is said to be a "disease of tears", and explains that the quality of tears is broken, and tears do not spread evenly on the surface of the eyes.
Mr. Kishita said, "Contact lens users are about four times more likely to use it," and urged attention by saying, "Don't use it for a long time or sleep while wearing it. "
He said he would put the computer's screen below the height of the eyes and humidify the air conditioner in a room where the air conditioner was effective.
We also introduced ingredients and foods that are effective for dry eye.
"Omega 3, which is included in blue fish, prevents tears from evaporating, and mutin, which is often found in natto and okra, increases the quality of tears."
For cataract surgery, the intraocular lens inserted instead of the crystal body has a monofocal and multifocal focus, and it touched on the difference in appearance.
Approximately 40 people participated in the seminar.
As a measure to prevent the novel coronavirus infection, it was divided into two parts, morning and afternoon, and it was opened to a small number of people, and the temperature inspection and disinfection before admission, and adequate ventilation of the venue was carried out.

G-Osaka: What is the possibility of making a J1 debut against 17-year-old FW Karayama and Kobe?
■Miyamoto's "Score Capacity Suddenly" (Sports News) - Yahoo! News
On Monday, G-Osaka's 43-year-old director, Tsunehiro Miyamoto, told reporters in front of a four-time victory against Kobe (Noesta on the 26th), revealing his expectations for his 17-year-old FW, a third-year high school student, who became a member of the top team for the first time in the previous section.
Karayama, who was promoted to the top rank in this season's flying class, became a bench member in a match against Hiroshima on the 22nd.
I did not give the opportunity to compete, but so far J3 has ordered a striker who has scored 3 points and results in 5 games this season, "There is a protruding part about taking a point. I am 17 years old, but I want you to play more gum shara. I have seen players going overseas at a young age, but I want you to play with high consciousness and greed."
Karayama played 10 games and 8 goals in J3, which he played as a specially designated player last season.
It is slender at 178 cm and 65 km, but it boasts an amazing score rate of 11 goals in 15 games in J3, with a sense of taking the back of the DF in an instant, and calmness up to a shoot to be shown in front of a crowded opponent's goal.
In the match against Hiroshima, FW Ademiuson and MF Onoze were injured and got out of the bench, but there was no opportunity to compete in Tangshan.

Twenty-six years ago, a stolen Ferrari was discovered at the bottom of the river.
In 1994, Ferrari Mondial was stolen in the Netherlands.
The police were too late to solve the problem, but 26 years later, the mondals were miraculously discovered.
The discovery of Ferrari (four photos) at the bottom of the river was triggered by the fire department's diving training.
On 8 July, a trained diver discovered something of a wedge shape sinking into the bottom of the river, and the police and even the Dutch army evacuated it, where it was Ferrari Mondial.
By matching the VIN number with the stolen car database, the Ferrari could be associated with the 1994 incident.
The car was handed over to its legal owner, the insurance company, and then sent to the scrapper.
The scrapper Lowie van DE Ooyevaar said, “There are still some remaining parts, but it’s for the art you want to decorate. We’ve already received a lot of requests from people who want to make tables from a tumbled-up MONDIAL. We’re using engine blocks and glass plates.”
For the time being, the company doesn’t have any specific plans to sell it, so it’s going to be stored by scrappers as an object-like entity.

U.S. Route 152 stops 10 kilometres from 'traffic' in heavy rain and north-eastern Japan, leaving some sections of JR Iida Line unattended | Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan
National Route 152 has become an all-way stop, and a line of cars waiting for the pass of the one-sided alternating passway circuit is said to be located in Ryuzan-cho, Tenryu Ward, Hamamatsu City on the afternoon of the 22nd.
The Tenryu area in Hamamatsu City was devastated by heavy rains in July, which caused severe damage to various parts of Japan including Kyushu.
The impact of landslides remains on the National Route 152 on the main road and the JR Iida Line on "Life's Foot" and there are many places where it takes time to recover.
In addition to the inconveniences of daily life, residents are concerned about adverse effects on economic activities.
The Sejiri-bashi Bridge, which runs along the Tenryu-gawa River in Ryuzan-cho, Ryuzan Ward, continues a long line of trains waiting for passage during the day.
The first car remained at the stop for nearly 40 minutes.
National Route 152 became a full stop of about 10 km, and it is necessary to circumvent the Tenryu-gawa River to move within the town.
However, the road is narrow, the entire section is one-sided alternating, and the waiting time can not be predicted.
On the 9th, a landslide broke down on the national highway, and it was blocked due to the danger of falling stones on the nearby slopes.
On the 13th, cracks were found in the Akiha tunnel in the regulated section, and the timing of reopening has not yet been established.
As a result of the collapse of the city in 2018, the national highway was blocked, and it was devastating for residents' lives and tourism.
Mr Tamamoto, the 76-year-old president of the dragon mama processing plant that sells specialty products, said, "We're going to catch up with our customers while they're away due to the novel coronavirus. We're going to have a lot less visitors."
The JR Iida Line is not connected between Mizuho Station (Mizuho-cho, the same Ward) and Hiraoka Station (Nagano Prefecture) due to the fall of the slope on the side of the track.
Mr. Ukai, (16) who was attending Hamamatsuko Kita Takasakuma branch school in Sakuma-cho, the same Ward from Oarashi Station (in the same town) in the unattended section, was required to pick up a car for about an hour one-way.
Both parents and themselves are burdened by cars," he said, hoping for an early recovery.
According to JR Tokai, it is expected to take about three months to reopen, and on the 27th, a special train will run between Mizuho Station and Owari Station one by one in the morning and evening on weekdays.
In Minamata town, there are many landslides in the forest road which has become a living road.
In some cases, it takes several hours to go around.
Kumagaya Keiji, the 69-year-old director of the Minamata-cho Forestry Association, said, "Origination of raw wood is also stagnant. There is an island on land everywhere. We are worried about the future of rain."

Families whose wives hold their wallets are 45 %!
Is my husband happy or unhappy?
I don't know if my husband told me to pay me this month, but it's not enough, or if you're in the middle of your stomach, don't you think?
The family in which this conversation takes place is the family in which the wife holds the purse.
How many families in the world do their wives hold their wallets?
Also, let's look at the percentage of "marital purse " "co-management" together.
Who holds the household wallet?
Matsui Securities Co. , Ltd. conducted an Internet survey of 400 men and women in their 20s and 30s (young couples ) within three years of marriage across Japan, 400 men and women in their 50s and 60s (mature couples ) in their 30s and over, and 800 people in total.
who's holding the household wallet?
Wife: 45.0% Husband: 24.8% Families whose wives manage households were the most common results.
Whether you manage it or not, there seems to be a variety of episodes, although it is household management that there is a twist.
My wife manages the household: In the case of A-ko, A-ko is the Wamma of Alafif, who has a daughter in the third and first grades of high school.
AChildren are in full control of their household finances.
I negotiated with my husband to pay a small amount of money, but the plan was decided and I was resisted because there were more months when I had to wait for the university entrance exams and the number of months when the deficit came out.
At that time, I was told to show me what kind of balance it was, so I showed the household account book.
I was supposed to have listed all the expenses, but when I looked at the household account book, it was not enough balance to become a deficit.
My husband seemed to be approached by me saying, "You're insufficient," but A-kosan could not help but say, "Okay, I don't have the power to manage my household budget, so please take care of it all."
Later, in an interview with her husband, A-ko said, "I am dissatisfied with the management of allowances, but it is true that there is no time and energy to manage various household expenses (e. g. school materials and PTA expenses). "
My husband manages the household budget: In the case of B-ko, a full-time housewife, B-ko is given living expenses from her husband and is packed every day.
Last spring, because the freezer part of the refrigerator was broken, B-ko asked her husband to buy a refrigerator.
However, my husband was reluctant to repurchase it, saying, "Refrigerator is not good, but you can still use the refrigeration part, so it's okay."
However, in summer, it seems that my husband wanted to prepare an environment where he can eat ice cream at any time, "Let's buy a refrigerator, after all", the palm of his hand turned back.
It is said that Mr. B complained to his friend, saying, "My husband is so jealous of me."
Kenei Kubo moved to the 5 clubs of the 1st division of Spain (East Spo Web) - Yahoo!
This season, it seems that the transfer destination of the Japanese national team MF Kenei Kubo (19), who played in the first part of Spain Majorca, is gradually narrowing down.
Although Majorca was relegated to the second division, Hisayasu's reputation skyrocketed due to his success at the end of the season.
However, it is difficult to return to Real Madrid, which has a "holding right" in relation to the outside of the EU, and I plan to play with other clubs next season.
Approximately 30 clubs have already received offers, but R Madrid plans to train warriors at domestic clubs.
The Spanish newspaper Marca reported that the clubs of Real Sociedad, Villareal, Granada, Hetafe, and Betis were the main players in Kubo, and that "five clubs are interested in acquiring Kubo, but R Madrid wants more than the middle of the league."
Among them, Villareal and R Sociedad have the right to compete in the European League (EL) next season, and Granada also meets the requirements of the team required by R Madrid to participate from the second round of the EL qualifying.
What kind of decision will the world's number one big club make for the expulsion of "Japan's treasures"?
