Welsh MPs worry if they look like muppets.
There was concern among some MPs at a suggestion that their designation should be changed to MWPs (Members of Welsh Parliament).
This arose from a plan to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum are concerned that it could invite ridicule.
A Labour MP said that his group was concerned, The title was synonymous with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
One assemblyman (AM) said that his group as a whole, felt "not happy" and had proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open-minded" to the name change, but judged that it was a celebration of the abbreviation MWP for Muppet.
In this context the w in Welsh is pronounced like the u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: The final decision on any explanation regarding the designation for the AMs is of course a matter for the members themselves.
The 2017 Welsh Government Decision empowers the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on a proposal known to have gained widespread support to call the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the designation of MPs, the Commission favours WMPs, but the MWP option gained the most support in the public consultation.
The MPs seem to be proposing alternatives, but the struggle to reach a consensus could confuse the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on the changes within weeks.
This reform bill will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules disqualifying the A.M.s and a draft committee system.
The A.M.s will get the final say on the question of how they should be called when they discuss the bill.
Macedonians go to vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will decide whether their country's name will be changed to Republic of North Macedonia.
The famous vote was held in an effort to settle a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor indicates a recognition of its territory and has repeatedly rejected offers of EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, an opponent of the vote for the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to pay for joining the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's didn't ring when the churches in Harlem were in trouble.
"Historically, the old folks I talked to said there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adam.
Today, there is none.
He said that the disappearance of all the bars was justifiable.
"People are socializing in a different way now", he said.
 The bar is no longer a living room of the neighborhood where people visit it regularly.
As for the church, he was worried that the money from the sale of assets would not last as long as the leaders had hoped, and sooner or later they would go back to square one.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not help maintain the remaining holy places around them.
"The majority of people who will buy condos in these buildings are white", he said, "and therefore will hasten the day when these churches close at the same time because it is unlikely that people who move into those condos will be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930's.
The black congregation that had been worshiping in the area had taken over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard, who led a retail boycott of 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, which refused to employ or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused severe damage to the building, but when the Reverend Johnson parishioners planned to rebuild, they built a bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Reverend Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's proudly calls the tower bells "The poor man's bells".
An expert who rang the tower bells in July gave it another designation: A cultural treasure and An irreplaceable historical instrument.
An expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also notes that this was the first bell in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to ringing the larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders, and others brought in by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the governing body of the diocese, which is made up of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese would seek to charge the vestry fees, even though the vestry was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injures a 13-year-old in a lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was diving to catch lobsters in California during the opening event of the lobster season, an official said.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy pleading for help and then rowed in a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a flurry of excitement after catching the lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I got bit!"
I got bit!
His entire skull was torn, and Hammel said he realized it when he grabbed the boy.
I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is being treated in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Coast rescue captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark had been seen in the area a week earlier, but it was categorized as a harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for the purposes of investigation and for security.
Giles realized that there were more than 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them were considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plan to break into the British beauty market
Sainsbury's took over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with their full-service beauty kiosks run by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial boost to the £2.8 billion UK beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and household goods decline, larger beauty kiosks will be trialled at 11 stores nationwide and will be expanded to more stores next year if successful.
Investments in beauty are a hunting ground for supermarkets to exploit shelves that were once used to display TVs, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its beauty offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing line of brands starting from LOreal, Maybelline and Burts Bees will also get more space with branded areas like those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched its boutique makeup line so that most of its products will be vegan-friendly - something that is gaining traction among young shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small quantities of everyday food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets must do more to entice people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said that stalls will increasingly look like malls as supermarket chains try to fight back against pushers like Aldi and Lidl by providing over- and no-food service.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos stalls in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat stores since they bought both franchises two years ago, which it says has supported daily grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
Previous efforts by the supermarket to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to share profits from the chemist's shop in the supermarket.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmacy businesses to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy franchise, for £125 million, three years ago.
It is rumoured that Lloyds will play a role in the plan, adding various luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of beauty stalls to improve the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to fit all needs, the enticing environment and convenient location signify that we are now a charming destination challenging the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones screams after Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones leaves in a fit of rage after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11m lifestyle business deal to focus more on her new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to manage their household appliances and accessories brand, Truly.
The pair's business is being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning, used his Instagram account to announce that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den star Petes Jones furious by withdrawing at the last minute, from their lucrative branded lifestyle business - to focus on her bigger contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was so "grumpy" when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their household appliances and accessories brand, Truly.
Their business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune by £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes,
A source said: "Truly is by far Holly's most important priority.
It was supposed to be his long-term future, which would keep him going for decades to come.
His decision to step down stunned everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready to sell.
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most expensive stars, could cost the company up to millions of dollars due to massive investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home furnishings, as well as the potential for further delay in the launch.
And this could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on this business relationship".
We talked seriously and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for making comments that some considered to be "unpresidential" and having been very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mocking tone of his own news readers.
I'm not giving up anything.
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting a second time after the previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a step forward for denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see an appropriate response from the United States to the initial move to disarm North Korea.
Instead, he noted, the United States maintained sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump is more optimistic in his series of speeches.
"We do our best with North Korea", he said.
If we go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this amazing relationship,
He said that his success in improving relations with Kim has led to positive results - stopping the rocket tests, helping to free the hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unconventional approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, there is no national disaster declaration, as a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is a bit challenging", Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said that Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute to providing aid.
Given the ongoing earthquakes Indonesia is experiencing, the country is still very unprepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The absence of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite the danger warning already being issued, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A floating hospital that has been placed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made repairing Indonesia's broken infrastructure the core of his election campaign, and he has spent money on building highways and railways.
But the lack of funds has hampered Mr. Joko's government as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim-majority members have embraced a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Muslim and Christian mobs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League by a single score in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards outside Chelsea's goal as his team trailed 1-0.
He places the ball on his left side before kicking it towards the far pole.
The ball is flown high above the goal as it is flown into the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually fell past Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get in that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I just try to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and take a chance and didn't think much about it, and just did the kick.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the first half after Belgian forward Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue forward provided feedback to Mateo Kovacic on the play, before turning near midfield and running fast into Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic quickly passed and ran in the midfield.
He then made the perfect kick, leading Hazard towards the goal.
Hazard managed to pass the opposing defender and kick the ball into the corner of the goal with a left foot kick, passing Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool are facing Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are facing Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit on Friday and triggered waves as high as 20 feet, said Sutopo Purwo, spokesman for the agency at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, is littered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John Street, at 7.55am with multiple stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked anyone in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in the early stages but I am asking everyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious to contact us.
I also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may be recording something on the dashboard camera to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt confident they knew the woman had come to the scene to inquire about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still ongoing as police have said, they are in the process of informing the next of kin of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just returned to his apartment, but police have told him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
The man couldn't say anything when he found out what was happening.
Residents are being told it will take a few hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer is heard telling someone that all areas are now being treated as crime scenes.
A woman showed up at the scene in tears.
He kept saying, "This is terrible".
At 2pm two police vans were in line and the other was outside.
A number of officers lined up to monitor the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCc, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 by quoting log 247 on September 30.
The statue of Cromwell's Parliament became the last memorial to be affected by the "historical rewrite".
His expulsion would be poetic justice for the Taliban's destruction of many British cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwellian public dismissed Mr Crick's suggestion as "foolish" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is unavoidable in the current debate over the destruction of statues, that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will be the target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil war was neither ordered nor done by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell line would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas a century earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's remarkable representation of Cromwell is a 19th-century testament to the opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as the parliamentary defender against outside pressure, in his case of course the royal.
Whether it is a fully accurate representation, is still the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of the nation, and Cromwell was a recognizable individual who represented one side of that difference.
His success as Master Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
Killer pigs torture Chinese farmers to death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeastern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a severed, bloody artery near a pigsty in the Liupanshui area market of Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with a vaccine at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He reportedly went with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Thursday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the door to the nearby pigsty had been opened.
He said that in the pigsty there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research confirms that the 550-pound male pig had been mistreating the farmer to death, according to reports.
"My cousin's bed is bloody and shattered", said the cousin known as the Wu clan, as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pigs had been caged to prevent them from attacking others, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig strapped a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife panicked and chased the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but the smell of blood can act as a trigger.
They're just playing.
They're biters, so curious... they won't come out to hurt you.
You just have to give him enough respect, he said.
The remnants of Rosa brought widespread heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over the cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
In any case, Rosa will cause flooding across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 storm, beginning at 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is likely to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the storm began to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward, toward the U.S. West Coast, as Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began pushing tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates approaching 2 to 3 inches per hour at some points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Two to four inches of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Flooding is likely to occur with conditions deteriorating rapidly due to the nature of the dispersed tropical rainfall.
It is highly discouraged to explore the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause the gorge to become a fierce river and storms will bring local strong winds and dust.
The approaching trough will cause local heavy rainfall to part of the Southern California coastline.
Total rainfall in excess of half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and the highway to slip.
This will be the first rain in the region of their rainy season.
Some of the scattered tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more extensive on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October will see some dramatic temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
There was a specific example of a dramatic temperature difference across the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining heat of summer will build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to warm beginning in October with a rate of spread of 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could get to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is expected to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show a high chance for above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through mid-to-early October.
Over 20 million people have seen the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people watched the sensational remarks Thursday by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular shows to report the last-minute surprise of Friday: a deal engineered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the woman was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk and trying to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
There are likely to be over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, who have watched it.
The company counts the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Calculations for other networks that broadcast this were not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting the number of people who watch it in the office.
To put this in perspective, that's the same number of viewers as a football playoff or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion of the show's hosts was strongly in favor of Kavanaugh's appointment, topped all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearings, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million viewers and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The crowd stays high after the trial.
Flake was a key figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being booed by protesters as he tried to climb the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood bowed down for a few minutes as he was being taunted, broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think that he was telling the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have power when there are many women who are powerless".
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in the committee meeting.
Cable TV and broadcast networks all cover live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee will vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would review the charges against the candidate over the next week, as requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake has been convinced in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with the Coons and a few senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has power, because it's clear that the Republicans won't have the vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister accuses critics of playing politics on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests, over her plans to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, on Sept. 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews featured him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed the attack on what he called the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal about the UK and EU having to collect tariffs on each other was "completely absurd".
Police have arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in jail on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of Sims and Simpson confronting each other, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on the item, WAFB affiliate CBS reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said that he confessed to having committed the fatal shooting of Wayde.
The contract has been set at $350,000, the attorney reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and the surrounding community for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the county law enforcement for their "persistence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
The 6-foot-6 lived in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average is 5.6 and he's up to 2.6 in games last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time", Wade said.
Volcanoes spewing ash in Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern area around Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased at the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in a span of more than 24 hours.
The center is monitoring multiple thunder and vibrations.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash sticking to the windshield of a car in a neighborhood around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity at the volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as Don Goyo which has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the celebration of the independence election.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarized vote on secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists detained by riot police threw them with eggs and powdered paint, creating a dark cloud of dust on the streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
A fight ensued later that day with police using their batons to control the fight.
For several hours pro-independence groups shouted "No forget, no forgiveness" against the union protesters who shouted, "Life to Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protest, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-oriented region, a year after the October 1 referendum that was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters preferred to be independent, although the turnout was low with those opposing secession and the majority boycotting the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at TPS across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer had hope about Catalonia's prospects for independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they could choose, but now we're stuck", she says.
Despite winning a vital but modest victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year despite many of their well-known leaders, either in exile or in custody awaiting trial, for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on her phone in support of the police, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense", he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings says that damage occurred to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
The goal scored by Menga had given Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston's victory saw Rangers sack Steven Gerrard from his position as manager of Ibrox, for their second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's attack has proved to be a difference when Gary Holt's side move is equal to Hibernian's second.
Gerrard's side remain winless in the Premiership this season and face the Hearts leaders who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League, on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their undefeated record in the division to six games, while head coach Holt is still in the losing streak since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed a chance against a careless away team
The Holt team should have been ahead long before they scored, with their accuracy giving Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson made the breakthrough but missed the front of the field, then Alan Lithgow only managed to widen his efforts after slipping in and facing Craig Halkett's swing from across the field.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play ahead at the start, knowing that they could make it difficult for the incoming team over a dead ball.
And that's how you make a very important goal.
Rangers conceded the free-kick and Livingston got the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got the turn and scored from midfield.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated the field but realized that the home defense was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not affected overall,
The pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to fish for a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was stolen by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow were knocked out by another Livingston game tactic.
Attacks kept coming to Livingston's goal and were consistently avoided, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge to substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were rejected.
"Fenomenal" by Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
For one man, they're extraordinary, continually surpassing expectations on this ever-increasing trajectory.
Their style of play and personnel have hardly changed since their return to the top flight, but great credit must be given to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He has so much heroism.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a well-organized defense, while Mena kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
Still, the Rangers are lacking in inspiration.
No matter how good they were under Gerrard, they failed to live up to that standard.
Their last ball was not good - only once could they break the home side formation - and it was a warning to the Rangers, who were aware of their presence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne.
There were smiles and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new grand mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the crowd of 25,000 people gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved to the surrounding area to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also took to the streets, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The resistance protest described the existence of an immigrant who was hailed as a hero by some German Turkish residents and derided as a dictator by others.
Bicyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car had stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision came months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and notify his family.
Roads have been closed and bus routes diverted and motorists have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in chaos
Six officers were injured in a riot at a maximum-security men's prison, the coroner's office said.
The chaos broke out at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist Tornado officers have been deployed to deal with the disturbance, which involved eight prisoners and occurred on one side of the building.
The officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained parole officers have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in this prison, and it's clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend more time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin prison houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the warden was hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October riot police were called to the jail to deal with a serious riot in which a police officer was attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding of the Bandang.
The tropical depression that hit Arizona is rare, but it's the one most likely to occur early next week as the remaining trace of Rosa's energy passes through the southwest desert, posing a risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for areas from western Arizona to southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight past Phoenix on Tuesday, hitting Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said on Twitter that there have only been 10 tropical cyclones capable of creating tropical storms or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest Storm Center Perimeter is capable of predicting 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with isolated amounts reaching 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert including the central Rockies and Great Basin are most likely to be affected by 1 to 2 inches, with possible amounts of isolation reaching 4 inches.
For those in flood-free areas, the Rosa may be a blessing because the region is experiencing a drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, only about 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, weather.com reports.
First, the path through which Hurricane Rosa led to land across Baja California Peninsula in Mexico
Rosa, still in hurricane strength Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encountered the cooler waters of the Pacific and thus weakened.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or night.
Heavy rainfall is likely in parts of Mexico, posing a high risk of flooding
Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected to hit the Baja California region as far as the southwestern region of Sonora, possibly rising to 10 inches, weather.com reports.
Rosa will then cross north along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will cross Arizona and into southern Utah by Tuesday midnight.
The main risk posed by Rosa or its remnants is very high rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. southwest desert region. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) states.
The rains are expected to cause the threat of flooding and debris that will flow into the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: arrest of four suspects in attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a stab wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 0400 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, police said.
Officials are urging anyone who may have video footage of the incident on their cell phone to come forward.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "received hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and shameful tactics", Trump said at a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "received the hatred and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcibly and emotionally denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually assaulted him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his testimony.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's intelligence and quality and courage that day.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm someone who has the most perfect legal minds of our time, a juror with a record of true public service", he told the West Virginia crowd of supporters.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running, he said.
That's why I went out there, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argues that Democrats are on a mission to "fight and block".
The first Senate-level voting procedure on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with casualty numbers rising
At least 384 people were killed, many washed up as giant waves hit the coast, as a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-meter (18-foot) wave washed ashore at dusk, causing many deaths and destroying everything it passed.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the threat of tsunami increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee so they became victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, timber, houses, hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed through the open ocean at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 service centers in Palu.
Aerial photos released by BNPB show many destroyed buildings and shops, a crooked and collapsed bridge and a mosque surrounded by water.
A series of aftershocks rocked the city along the coastline on Saturday.
The earthquake's tremors were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Bureau of Particle Physics and Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the explosive power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, can magnify the size of a tsunami, so to speak.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under the ruins of the destroyed buildings, he said, adding that there were 540 injured victims and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that casualties and damage could have been greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
Communication is completely crippled by the lack of information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its members and volunteers are heading to the disaster-affected area.
"It's a tragedy, but it could be worse", he said.
The relevant agency on Saturday received much criticism for not informing that a tsunami was hitting Palu, although authorities said the wave had already struck at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of a building being heard shouting panicked tsunami warnings to people on the streets below.
Within minutes, the water coils hit the shore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami were the biggest causes of power outages that cut communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes carrying aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the refugees are still in desperate need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport has reopened for relief efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami casualties increased to over 800.
That was awful.
When World Vision employees from Donggala made it safely to Palu city, where they took refuge in a packed tent built in their office yard, they had passed through various rough terrain on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed", he said.
It was horrible.
Even as the relief groups slowly began to move to begin disaster relief activities, some of them complained of the harassment of skilled foreign volunteers, who were about to leave for Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, aid and manpower from abroad can only be started if the disaster-hit area has been officially declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says, OK, this is a national disaster, we can get international aid, but there is no such status yet.
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and family of the missing victims still hope that their loved ones will be part of the miracle that will correct the dark storyline of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days with the mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parasailing team, has been the coach for the two missing parasailers, who had a chance to participate in the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those who are still trapped in the Roa-Roa Hotel, with Mr. Mandagi, are his disciples.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how after news of the Roa-Roa Hotel collapse circulated around the parasailing community, he desperately sent a WhatsApp message to the Palu competitors, who were participating in the celebration on the beach.
However, all the messages, instead of two blue ones, got one gray check mark.
"I thought it meant the message wasn't sent", he said.
Robbery took $26,750 during a charge at an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
Robbery on Friday morning, stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refilling the ATM storage box in Newport, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car has emptied an ATM machine at the entertainment complex and is preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a news release.
While he was working, another man ran behind Brink's worker and stole a bag of money to be sent.
Eyewitnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to reports, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identities can contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change via Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Formerly formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using the nickname Ye for some time and is using it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was made before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, when she was expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande to perform on the show, which was canceled for "emotional reasons", the show's creators said.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, West has previously said that for him the word has a religious meaning.
I believe that "ye" is a common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you", West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with broadcaster Radio Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, the name is us.
It's taken from Kanye, which means only one, to Ye -- as a mirror of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we really are.
He's one of a number of rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs has variously been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, also made it with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO vows not to use the military against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians ahead of the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged the day on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to never use military force to oppress the Mexican people.
Troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time, as the leftist student movement took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has already guaranteed support for Mexican youth by providing monthly subsidies to those who are in college and opening more free universities.
He says that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for A.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money it spends on research in the field, says A2 investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even as the U.S. as a whole lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: aiming to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling funding for AI research is a good start, considering all other countries tend to lag far behind the U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI breakthrough will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview on Sunday.
Lea, author of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed the AI system that beat America's best Othello player, and after that he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge for the Advanced Defense Research Project and asked when the next activities would be implemented, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win prizes from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking over academic leadership; it's the corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring people from universities for AI research for the past few years.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. to support efforts around AI.
"I think a green card could be offered automatically to a PhD in AI", he said.
The Chinese State Council released the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the U.S. the Department of Defense developed the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, DARPA recently invested over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for the establishment of a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not seen follow-up for months.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
Macedonians are voting on Sunday to decide on changing the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would settle a decade-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents recognition of ownership of its territory and has banned its accession to NATO and the European Union.
The two government parties reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opposition argued that the change would damage the identity of the majority of the ethnic Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the election and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the results could reach the minimum of 50 percent needed to declare the election as legitimate.
The question on the ballot reads: Do you agree to NATO and EU membership by accepting the existence of an agreement with Greece.
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a fair price to pay for allowing Macedonia, one of the states born from the break-up of Yugoslavia, into bodies like the European Union and NATO.
"I come here today to cast my vote for the future of the country, for the young generation of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a number of lawmakers have said they will follow the results of the vote to make decisions.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission says there were no reports of violations as of 1 p.m.
However, it turned out that the voting result reached only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to cast my vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko give their ballots for the general election in Macedonia in the framework of the country's name change that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, had prepared a small stage and pulled chairs in front of tents set up by those who were going to boycott the vote.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with honor, not through the door of the servant", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonians, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority of the population will agree with it because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO", Zaev said after giving his ballot.
He said the results would be a confirmation of our future.
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote - less than the required number.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV station Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to cast their ballots on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the vote to be successful, it takes 50 percent plus one vote.
A vote failure would represent the first policy rejection of a pro-Western government since taking office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City explores the whole of Brighton's defence to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were deployed as Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made the win look very easy on his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a central midfield pass at the start of the game.
He ran through three Brighton defenders, before desperately entering the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four men in green armour.
He spun past one defender before running ahead of several opponents again at the end of Brighton's goal.
Then he passes to his left, to Sterling.
The English midfielder used his first kick from the goal line to pass the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the goal.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his leg", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We're talking about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first lead in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero receives the ball, deep inside the Brighton area at that game.
He passed the ball with a stunning long kick through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little ball-pumping before leading Sterling to the farthest post.
Sky Blue's forward midfielder drove the ball towards the goal just before it slipped out of the boundary.
City against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to complain about the spoiler versus the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there's no reason to force another game.
But the overly competitive Scherzer hopes to outrun the Colorado Rockies in Sunday's game, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least earned a spot after winning the wild-card game against the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but are still trying to clinch their first division title.
Even though we're playing without a win, at least we can get a feel for this Denver crowd and other teams that are going to be competing at the highest level of any point I might face this year.
How could I not want to compete in a match like that?
The Nationals have not announced the opening game for Sunday, but it is reported that in such circumstances, they are likely to let Scherzer play.
Scherzer, who will start for the 34th time, held a training session on Thursday and began Sunday's game that is usually used for rest.
The Washington right-handed pitcher is a combined 18-7 with a 2.53 earned run average and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this session.
Trump is campaigning in West Virginia.
The president was implicitly referring to the situation involving his choice of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the midterm elections.
Everything we've worked for is at stake in November.
Five weeks before the most important election of our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't really run that's why I'm fighting everywhere for the great candidate, he said.
Trump continued, "You see there's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
And they decided to take back power by any means, you see their evil, their abomination.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to protect to get power and control, that's what they want, which is power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, were on a mission to "reject and block".
And you've seen it for the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats angry and evil and ugly and untrustworthy.
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, which was met with a rousing scorn from his listeners.
Remember what the answer is?
Did you leak the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I was waiting for him -- that was a really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a place of public service.
Now he's intolerant of anyone who expresses his opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to denounce me, it was no surprise.
After all, I was in the last row of MPs, who were told that our presence was not expected - all because we were expressing an opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was a strong advocate of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the criticism movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, an issue that ironically is the same as that opposed by Jeremy Corbyn and previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham east workers' meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive".
For almost eight years I was a member of the local Labour Parliament, the General Committee meeting on Friday night was exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many of the meetings and promises about a "better, friendlier" politics has long since been forgotten, if ever, it has begun.
Differences of opinion within the Labour party were increasingly clearly not tolerated and each opinion was judged on its merits by party authority.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader, as a colleague who I thought would share the same political views, starting to expect me to back down and accept positions that I would never have accepted before -- both in national security and in the EU single market.
Whenever I speak out - and no matter what I say - it's followed by a barrage of social media calls for the cancellation of the nomination, criticism of central politics, telling me I shouldn't have been in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me who's been through it.
Of course, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who face sexual harassment or racism every day but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current political era is how much abuse has been deemed reasonable.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should help develop a culture of tolerance.
The fact is we're no longer on the wider church and with every motion of "disbelief" or changing the selection of party rules becomes more limited.
I've gotten a lot of advice over the last two years that encourages me to keep my head down, not to say too much, and then I'll say, "Okay".
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government which led to my comprehensive school classes literally collapsing, I have striven to fight for better public services for those who need them most - both as a local councillor and a minister in government.
I've never hidden my political actions, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East would question my policy position and the things I disagree with in the current leadership.
To those who are pushing for a motion on Friday, what I can say is that as the country moves fast towards breaking up sovereignty, it will jeopardize our national business and public services, I don't want to waste time and energy on loyalty to the Labour leader.
But really, my one message is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my constituents, as a Labour member or not, and I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of removal or any political policy will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose, undefeated Ayr to the top of the standings
The last two attempts may have cheated the final outcome a bit, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved to win Tennent's Premiership match which was very entertaining today.
Now they're in the top, the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, their superior defense, and ability to grab the best chances, which earned the home team and coach Peter Murchie the right to feel happy.
"So far we have tested our game, and we are still undefeated so we feel happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "Acknowledgement for Ayr, they're better at taking chances than we are".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, given on that play by the Warriors, gave Melrose the chance to score and Jason Baggot grabbed the unconverted try.
Climo loosened Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, just in half-time, he scored then made a single try to make Ayr 17-5 at half-time.
However Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt was altered by Baggot, reducing the chances to five points.
Then there was a long hiatus as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury, was sidelined, and since the restart of the match, Ayr had been moving faster than Stafford McDowall's trial effort, modified by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and again, Melrose made a reserve player pay with an unmodified Bruce Colvine try, at the end of the hard press.
The hosts had returned to play, however, by the time Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for backing Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived behind the injured Ayr who were advancing.
Climo was replaced, as he was again, almost from the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe kicked a goal and thwarted the fifth attempt of the opener Gregor Henry.
The Still Game star looks set to embark on a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Kieran looks set to make a move into the catering industry after it was previously reported that he was named a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old's portrayal of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he directed and also starred in with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pair have already announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the final episode, and it appears Kiernan is planning to direct the live broadcast after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source with the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the booming restaurant business in Glasgow.
The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that the courts will reopen the path to the Pacific.
Marines are patrolling the base of the navy, located in La Paz.
Public buildings hoist a blue sea flag.
Naval bases from Titicaca to the Amazon were painted with the motto: "The sea is our rightful possession".
To rise again is a duty.
Beyond land-locked Bolivia, memories of losing a coastline to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict are still vivid - like the desire to once again sail across the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is likely to reach its peak in a few decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course positive expectations about the outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ trial on national screens, hoping that the court in The Hague will uphold Bolivia's demand that - after decades of tense negotiations - Chile be obliged to negotiate guarantees of Bolivia's sovereignty over the seas.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous Bolivian president - who faces a controversial battle for next year's re-election - also had a lot of support at Monday's trial.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific Ocean", he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the courts are unlikely to decide Bolivia's wishes - and that would change only slightly if it were possible.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the power to hand over Chilean territory, and has already determined that it will not decide the outcome of any negotiations.
That the ICJ ruling came just six months after the final arguments had been heard, indicating the case was "not complex", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
And far from continuing Bolivia's claims, the last four years may have been a setback.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the Bolivian government now", he said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has weakened the goodwill of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point remain negotiating, but it will be very difficult to remain negotiating after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the deputy of the Bolivian government in The Hague, rejected the idea of quick decision-making.
Monday will give Bolivia a "tremendous opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement to mutual advantage", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - used the maritime issue as a political prop.
Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The trial was an opportunity to see if we needed to settle the past.
North Korea says denuclearization won't happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said first that his country would never disarm if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday during the UN General Assembly.
He mentioned the United States implementing an agreement made at a meeting in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be about to begin nuclear diplomacy that has been stalled for more than three months after meeting with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri said it was a "dream" that continuing U.S. sanctions and rejection of the declaration of the end of the Korean War would make North Korea surrender.
Washington was wary of approving the declaration without Pyongyang making efforts to restrict its armed forces first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about recognizing the arsenal that is the only way for the country to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump
The Paris fashion show showcases a multitude of the latest collections of headgear up to the main street near you
If you want to add to your collection of hats or really want to get out of the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne released a series of large-size head covers for their SS19 collection on the stage of a fashion show with a stunning style held at Paris Fashion Week.
The completely impractical hats have been sweeping Instagram this summer and these designers have been showing off their eye-catching creations on the stage.
A highlight of Valentino is a cream-colored hat with a wide rim of a fur coat that covers the model's head.
Large-size accessories include a diamond-encrusted watermelon, a witch's hat and even a pineapple, but they are not made to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a collection of weird-looking masks just before Halloween.
Many of the masks are in different colors with sewn lips and look more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature resembles a scuba diving kit equipped with a snorkel and goggles, while the other looks like melting ice cream.
And if you keep looking through the great fashion collection -- you're in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that such a large collection of hats will be marketed on the main street near you.
The large-sized hats became a big seller in La Bomba, straw hats with two-foot-wide rims seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult of the label behind the hat is so impractical the hypocrisy of social media makes a huge creation on the beach catwalks of straw bags almost the size of a swimsuit - worn by a fussy model.
The burnt orange raffia bag, cut with raffia on the edge with a white leather strap, was a highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity hair stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing big hats and beach bags coming to the main streets for next summer - because designers are already making such an impact, it's going to be hard to ignore the demand for such big accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizenship.
Scottish private schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with outstanding test results, which are further reinforced by each student's and the collective success in sports, the arts, music and hard work.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best possible service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their role as citizens of the world.
As the education sector is able to design and implement school curricula in a way that is expected, we see modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, your words will go to their head.
If you speak to him in his language, your words will reach his heart".
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest test results this year, we can see that language is at the top of the league table with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who study a foreign language get an A plus.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also achieved A grades.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as essential skills that will surely be needed by children and adolescents in the future.
Today languages, as a subject choice, are held to the same standard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of modern schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Department for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of the many reasons why employers should continue to struggle to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly encouraged to prepare teenagers for their future careers.
With the increasing number of job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if they have already learned a second language, in the future they will experience the real benefits of having this kind of life-long skill.
Being able to communicate directly with residents of a foreign country will automatically make a multilingual superior in competition.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them do not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French is the only language spoken in the double-digit percentage, which is 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching for today's children is so important for today.
Having a multilingual background, especially in the languages of developing economies, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach a different language.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important in the UK for the next few years, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in a private school, with a staff of teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish independent schools are intended to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It is undeniable that today, in the global business environment, language will always be an important aspect in determining the future of a country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered truly "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
It's the right thing to do.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron is making his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans' wait to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not been determined how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for just a few minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to do a preseason game to prepare", he said.
The schedule of the Trump summit in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins his busy campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including stops at several fun spots that span Tennessee and Mississippi.
After insisting that the vote be delayed so that he could choose a Supreme Court nominee, Trump intended to build support for him for the upcoming midterm elections as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote is held in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trump public hearing in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 PM ET this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is increasingly tense after allegations of sexual misconduct and the anticipated Senate vote will be delayed for a week while the FBI investigates him.
But the main purpose of this rally's agenda is to help the Republican party gain some momentum in the run-up to the November general election.
Therefore, the Trump campaign said that the five rallies next week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will be traveling as much as possible to states as we face a busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the rally tonight is expected to draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as draw media coverage from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in a month, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for West Virginia's Senate, who is falling behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come in as an effort to increase his turnout in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show courage to defend its hopes in the single match on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome session is what may be needed in this Ryder Cup.
The swing of momentum is a sporting concept that is the result of findings that are fully trusted by the players, and none surpasses that in competitions like this.
Where do they think the momentum is now?
"Before, they were six points ahead and now four, so I think we saw it as a bit of momentum", said Jordan Spieth as the day passed.
Of course Europe has the advantage of being four points ahead with twelve games to go.
But Team USA, as Spieth said, felt they had a little bit of momentum and they had a lot of things that could be the spirit, not to mention the lineup of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasted three out of four points.
Spieth has played deadly from the tee to the green and led by example.
The boat's celebratory shouts grew louder as his turn came, delivering the crucial putting stroke to make the game a series as he and Thomas lost two-to-two.
The punch from him that won them at number 15 was greeted with a similar cry, a cry that tells you that he's confident America isn't losing.
"You really have to try harder and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
All these players are gone now.
18 holes to mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup.
A unique but interesting pair from Europe are four for four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to do bogey punches on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The run, and how their energy seemed to flow both into and out of this crowded crowd convinced them that they were the players to beat on Sunday, and no player more famous than Fleetwood or Molinari would lock in a potential European victory as the sun set over Le Golf National.
It's better if they're both in different holes at the same time.
However, it is still too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson cut short the work of Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine is like digging a hole that these Spanish and Swedish golfers will never be able to climb.
Although, on Sunday no one can help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are a great show to watch up close because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and led quite a way towards the final day, but the foursome session also showed that the US team has the guts to compete despite doubts from some, especially in the United States.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of the Ryder Cup final day after rebounding from Saturday's fourball and foursome game with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead with two wins over Tiger Woods who had to struggle to score their points so far at Le Golf National by four points.
European team Thomas Bjorn, looking to defend the trophy they missed in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong-footed American team in the morning fourball, making the series 3-1.
The United States put up more resistance in the foursome, winning two games, but they were unable to reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from 12 Sunday singles matches to defend the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debutant to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after the sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball they became very solid to beat Woods's pitcher and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau by more decisively 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally performed brilliantly but he has lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome as well as seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting on the morning fourball, then returned to pair with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lost 2&1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - world ranked one and three.
Europeans did not reach it alone despite a nice, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American record by two points on Saturday.
They got an impressive 2-1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourball then came back again to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit to enter a single game, although as defending champions the Furyk team only needed points to retain the trophy.
However, after being second best for two days, Sunday's counterattack looked like it would overtake them.
North Korea says it's 'impossible' to unilaterally disarm without any trust
On Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister told the UN that sanctions were continuing to deepen their distrust of the United States and that it was unlikely that the country would unilaterally divest itself of its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant steps that show goodwill" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and pledging not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any appropriate response from the United States", he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation it is not possible for us to disarm ourselves first unilaterally".
While Ri repeated the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be punished for taking gradual steps, a significant statement was made that they did not reject fully as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the newly-established summit between US presidential officials and the North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, at which time Kim pledged to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first stop its nuclear weapons.
Washington also rejected calls for the lifting of heavy international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insisted on 'denuclearization first' and increased pressure with the imposition of semi-forcible sanctions to achieve their goals, and even rejected 'the end of war declarations,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that such continuous sanctions will only deepen our distrust".
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the problematic party in this denuclearization is South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not come to this kind of dead end".
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he spoke at the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean rockets on the US mainland was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "destroy" North Korea completely, lavished praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but the big work still has to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter", he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the move.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and must not fail until we know that denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to stop Pyongyang's funding of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had actually been progress, only that North Korea within hours had insinuated that he was making "gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle missile sites as well as nuclear complexes if the United States takes "appropriate action".
He stated that Kim's orders to him to take "actions consistent with his wishes" were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is getting all of its S1 students to sleep more, in an effort to counter the macho culture of learning that's evolving through caffeinated 'owl humanity.'
One academic found that students at the world's top universities often know nothing about the very basics of how to protect themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
'Finally a girl came to me and said: 'Why was I only told now, in my final year?'
The girl said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first launched this year, explains to students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding students who were severely sleep-deprived throughout the week.
This one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session, there was a dorm room presentation, where students clicked on coffee cups, curtains, sweatpants, and books to get an explanation of the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants were given explanations as to how long sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know this won't change student behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,' adds Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in 'being big' still exists, he said, coupled with modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students that means sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough, good-quality sleep should be a 'secret weapon' against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he says - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep activates the brain's hunger mode, causing a feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian chemist and physical biologist who helped Professor Czeisler design the course, had taken one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize a course for the entire campus.
Next, he hopes that all graduate students will be instructed to complete similar programs of study before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students should consider setting their alarm for bedtime, as well as their wake-up alarm, and be aware of the effects of the blue light emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can shift your circadian rhythm out of its proper pathway and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: goal downs the men's minds of Gerrard
Again, the Rangers felt the sadness of a home-field day as Dolly Mena's attack sent the divorced Steven Gerrard's team into a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox were looking to record their first win on their way, since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side had just delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
Attacking seven minutes before the first half was over and the Rangers' mindless players didn't seem to be compensating.
While Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston have moved up to third, just behind goal difference from Hibernian.
And there could be further trouble at the Rangers' camp after line guard Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Instead, Holt is going with the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he'll be delighted with a costume that will dazzle their opponents at every opportunity.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston is using the ball they have better.
They should have scored within two minutes when the first short pass was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder pulled the big opportunity too wide.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free kick then met captain Craig Halkett but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide stitch in the back position.
Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than confidence about their play in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have got a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided at the quarter-hour mark but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers managed only two throws in the first half but previous Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely ever in trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head-butt and Ovie Ejaria's easily tamed attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their own hard work.
Once again the Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs' deep dead ball tactic.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and opted for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at half-time by substituting Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the substitution almost made an immediate impact as the winger put the ball on Morelos but Kelly's impressive play quickly went out of line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the away team to play the exact game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping all the long balls.
The Holt team should have widened their lead in the final stage but McGregor stood well to repel Jacobs before Lithgow swung wide from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty as he had a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned the tables.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now from the pages of our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and it will continue to be... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device being called the Geiger counter.
A staple of science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly unconvincing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What is that thing?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the mineral".
Evans: "Tell me, it's going to come out now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But it was his discovery that kept his name alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells
New cancer vaccines teach the immune system to 'recognize' malignant cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the process of extracting immune cells from patients, transforming them in the laboratory.
They can then 'identify' the protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
An experimental vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, and her ovarian cancer disappeared for over 18 months.
This method involves the process of extracting the patient's immune cells, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "identify" a protein commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, says: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
The same approach of taking a patient's immune cells and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West begins his pro-Trump diatribe, wearing a MAGA hat, after his SNL appearance.
Not Going Well
Kanye West was derided in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said that he would run in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, titled Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democratic Party and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Yeah, if I'm worried about racism, I'm out of America a long time ago", he said.
SNL kicked off the show with a play starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, footage of West's worms was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to mock West with the post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble backstage because of the hat he was wearing.
"They rounded me up backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat on.'
They're rounding me up!
And then they said I was drowning", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West goes on: "Do you want to see the sinking?" says that he's going to wear the Superman robe, because that means you can't dictate what I have to do.
Try to love".
His comments generated at least two rounds of derision from the audience and the cast of SNL looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling: "The whole studio is silent".
West was brought in at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, the ex-girlfriend of rapper Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confused many with his performance of "I Love It", dressed as the Perrier Bottle.
West was backed by the chair of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR HAVING BENEFITED THE PEOPLE".
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being herself and it was really great".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I believe embraces and spews an ideology that is dangerous to my community.
He's free.
So are we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the creature officially known as Kanye West".
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Alongside rapper Snoop Dogg, he got the name Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changing his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges of attempted murder for stabbing in a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
Defendants are expected to appear before Belfast County Court on Monday.
These charges will be reviewed by the Attorney General.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is critical of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword sword swinging role as Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor refutes the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such screen roles often make teenage boys feel that they must be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believed 'something was wrong' and questioned how to deal with the issue of bad masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted she felt 'strong enough' to discuss the issue.
'I feel personally, quite strongly, right now - where is our fault in this masculinity?' he said.
'What did we teach boys growing up, in relation to the problems we see today?'
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the emergence of a bad masculinity with its very masculine characters.
He continues: 'Where is the character from birth and what is it taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel that they must have this particular side to be a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of the day -- how do we change it?
Because there is clearly something wrong with the young.'
In the interview he also admitted that he will not be playing in a Game of Thrones prequel or sequel when the series ends next summer, saying that he is 'done with the battlefield and the horses'.
From November Kit will star in the return of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered a meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to leave Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, thus giving me a future family, and from here my life began,' he said.
Rose plays Ygritte, the love flower of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% spike in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, marking a change from the previous.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to near zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, year by year the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be on the rise.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many diseases are transmitted through inadequate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff have leaked GOP senator data, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that one of her staff members had forwarded the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators to the Wikipedia page of the congressman.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party insists that the claims are driven by experts and "ultra-right-wing" websites.
"Lies, lies, and many more vile lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It is reported that the information released includes the home address and phone number of United States Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all of Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
This leak came out shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the post was connected to Waters' office and revealed information one of Waters' staff members, Hill reported.
"These baseless allegations are completely false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
"My staff members - whose identity, personal information, and safety were threatened by deceptive and false allegations - are entirely not responsible for this leak.
These baseless accusations are completely false and utterly false".
Waters's statement quickly attracted criticism online, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection is anger", wrote Fleischer.
"This shows he's not fit to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
They must not deviate.
They can't question the accuser's motives.
They must be calm and peaceful".
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters's reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is trying to slide Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if true", he tweeted.
In its statement, Water said its office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities about these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he continued, "and they will be held legally accountable for all their actions that are damaging and harmful to any and all of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again review - a poorly written spoof of Rowan Atkinson
Now looking for Brexit significance in every new film with a biased view of English has become a tradition and that seems to apply to the resurgence of the Johnny English parody-comedy franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcasm about how obviously bad we are be a new export opportunity for this country?
Anyway, the spotty-eyed, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has renewed his license to mess things up for a second time - his name hinting more than anything that he is a vast comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemas.
He was certainly a mad secret agent who, despite his strange suspicions, had a bit of a Clouseau persona, a Mr Bean sequel and a wandering miniature that contributed a bit of notes to the Chariots of Fire theme at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
Indeed, he was based on the traveler and international mystery man once played by Atkinson in a now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving a mess behind.
There's been a sweet moment or two on this recent J.E. trip.
I love when Johnny English approaches the helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor propellers quickly attach to his helmet.
The Atkinson Award for physical comedy was shown, but its humor felt less energetic and too weird, especially when "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible had been confident to include comedy as material.
The humor felt more like it was aimed at children than adults, and to me the oddly uninnovative Johnny English was more focused on Atkinson's silent-film jokes in the Bean persona.
The premise that's been hot for years is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy web, exposing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of the agents in charge - unfortunately only a minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This was the last chance for the arrogant and hostile prime minister, who had already destroyed her total political popularity: Emma Thompson played a very good role as a quasi-Teresa-May character but not much could be done from her script.
His clever adviser informed him that since every active spy had been weakened, he would have to bring one out of retirement.
And that means the scumbag Johnny English himself, now employed as a principal in some fancy buildings, but giving a secret lesson in how to perform a cover-up: there's some good jokes here, when English offers a spy academy like the School of Rock.
English is sent back to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunited with his long-suffering old friend Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, engaged to a submarine commander, a top-class, suck-up-ass role where Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat sidelined.
So Batman and Robin, who had done wrong to His Majesty's Secret Agent, are back in action, meeting the mysterious beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister has fallen alarmingly under the influence of a charismatic tech millionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their ridiculous adventures: posing as waiters, they burn down a French fast-food restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury ship; and English sparks anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
All the stops are of course pulled for the last sequence, but with such hospitality and such ferocity, there's little children's TV channel that contains about everything.
It's a moderate thing.
And like all the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that was really suited to her talent?
The protest workers are devising a plan for the British to work four days a week but be paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would require Britons to work four days a week - but be paid five.
The union reportedly wants the owners to pass on the savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them extra days off.
He'll let the employees enjoy three weekends - but still get the same pay.
Some sources say that the idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to encourage the state to support the workers.
The four-day shift has been approved by the British Chamber of Commerce as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: 'A review of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'This will not happen overnight, but four days a week is an aspiration that is in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers and the party's industrial strategy as a whole.'
Labour was not the first to support the idea, as the Greens had already promised a four-day work week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, at present the aspiration is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: 'Four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to perfect his vision for a socialist revolution in the economic sphere.
McDonnell said he's determined to take back the power of the anonymous directors and the utility company's colorists.
The shadow chancellor's plan also means that current shareholders in the drinking water company may not get back their entire stake because the Labour government can make 'reductions' on the grounds of perceived infringement.
He also confirmed his plans to put workers on company boards and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 per cent of the company's equity in the private sector to employees, which would pocket an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh would change their view
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the bureau's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seems more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said I'd attend the trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the accusation came up, and said, 'Did you do it?'
He is a firm, determined, resolute man".
However, it seems that Graham's voice will not be changed.
"My mind has made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it takes a bigger indictment to change it", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but what I do know is: Brett denied it out loud", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he mentioned by name couldn't verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a string of stars performing with great brilliance, and a mission that is also memorable: to end poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against poverty.
To get free tickets to the show (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must complete a series of tasks or actions such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, making phone calls, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in the last 12 years in achieving its goals?
Is the idea of giving gifts in the form of free concerts the right way to get people to take action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feeling like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, prompting it to set other goals.
It is said that this action has helped to spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are equivalent to more than $37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group had collected 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, at least $10 billion of which had been channelled or fundraised.
The group estimates that safe funds have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make this social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Answering one of the FAQs on their website that asks "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that have gone before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars performing at this year's event in New York, which will be guided by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use Navy as "blockade" to impede Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could ask for the Navy's help to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly suspected that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where it operated at the legitimate invitation of the government - was a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is they want to be energy brokers, just like they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe", he reported.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that capability, with our Navy, to ensure the open sea lanes, and, if necessary, to blockade, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to participants at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the U.S.
He compared the approach taken by Washington in the deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they were equal.
"The economic choice in Iran and Russia is more or less, to use and replace fuels", he said, referring to Russia as one of the "experts in the field" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statement came as representatives of the Trump administration were on a mission to increase their exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unfit" Nord Stream 2 oil pipeline project, which Trump says is making Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 oil refinery project, designed to double the capacity of the existing refinery pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin denies that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely driven by economic reasons and constitutes an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be used as a tool to exert pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US attitude has attracted reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would face a big problem if third countries interfered with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "look into the situation" when running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "look into the situation" when running for president after the midterm elections.
While campaigning at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, including putting women in top positions", as she told The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will consider the situation when I run for president".
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while campaigning at city hall, saying that he was "taking this region in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren was outspoken in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents did not want him to run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "likely" voters in Massachusetts say the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent support the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent in favor of a possible run and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names in the Democratic Party discussed in connection with possible candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make his decision formally in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes PTSD from the track Palin during the Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in Sept.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going to go through when he comes back, I can relate to other families who are also feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are experiencing", he told an audience at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and told of his son and other war veterans, "They come back a little different, they come back louder, they come back and wonder if there's any respect for what they've given, fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military to the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence offences against a woman, plus reports of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supporting challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief Friday in Washington in support of asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. In a class action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and her son, who is a member of a brutal gang", had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
He's being held in Texas.
The state prosecutors in favor of Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which have produced large numbers of asylum seekers to the U.S., as countries that face major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy backfires with a 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision allowing black immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims must be decided on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the claim, and such prohibition violates principle", the friend-of-the-court brief said.
The prosecution further briefly opined that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, saying that they are most likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang atrocities.
"Asylum is available to those who have left their home countries because of persecution or fear caused by issues of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group, or political opinion", Sessions said in announcing the policy on June 11.
Asylum is not meant to alleviate all the problems -- even though all the problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
The desperate rescue effort in Palu as casualties doubled as the race against time to find survivors
For those who survived, the situation became even more dire.
"It's very stressful", says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who is comforting her fever-stricken son in a refugee center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
Clean water is very scarce".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up the flooded items, trying to salvage whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, and the damage caused by the 7.5 magnitude quake was devastating.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, lay outside the Hammer Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to the strong aftershocks.
Tears flowed as he recounted his feelings as the quake shook the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"No time to save myself.
I think I'm stuck in the rubble", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then I was silent.
I don't know the circumstances and my son.
May they live".
US ambassador accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after China's official newspaper ran a four-page ad in a US daily citing the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid-for supplement China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on Nov. 6, an accusation that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections, which marked what U.S. officials told Reuters, is a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war, which has led them to raise import tariffs on each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war are designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that favor Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor who long led Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt workers, farmers and businesspeople in America.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is now doubling down on the intimidation by running propaganda ads in our own free media".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of the tradition of free speech and press freedom that is so cherished in America by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the newsstands of the street vendors here in Beijing, you will find restrictions on different voices and you will not see the true reflection of the different opinions that Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent media outlets in China turned down an offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are keeping women voters away from the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh disaster.
With a flurry of Republican Party figures standing up and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault charges, analysts have warned they will see a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotion on this issue is very high, and most Republican members have already indicated that they want to advance on the ballot.
It's not preventable", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School, Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake's last-minute push for an FBI investigation would be enough to ease the anger of voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate aisle as Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"Enthusiasm and motivation for democracy will be off the list", non-party political analyst Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
"People say it's quite high; and it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, because they don't like the president, often don't vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing sexual abuse of him by the Supreme Court nominee, analysts warned of a follow-up counterattack if the Republicans still pushed him to go ahead with confirmation.
"It's been a mess for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about committee choices or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the bench, it's also about how the Republican Party handles this issue and how they handle it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect the Democratic Party, pointed to the news channel.
However, the American people seem to be divided as to who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the choice slightly more in favor of the latter.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents actually believe or may believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they actually believe or may believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh may or may not have lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's urging, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford and one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, who was in a drunken state, had assaulted him when he was 17.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her dick while attending a party when they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventors of the World Wide Web plan to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that was trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this tech legend, Inrupt, is a company built on the Berners-Lee open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to start now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
This storage can include a contact list, a to-do list, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all of which are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about this online storage of personal data is that it's really up to the user who can access what kind of information.
In the corporate world, it's called "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind establishing Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, was to have the company bring the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Now the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few staff developers who were hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can build their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not they would introduce a total change in which all their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
"We did not ask their permission".
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide energy and a commercial ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on top of Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even at the time of launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee would remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next web age", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: commemorating the scholars of WW1 Victoria Cross
The only clergyman in the Church of England to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a war hero, commemorated in his homeland 100 years later.
The Reverend Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the raids at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a "symbol of intelligence" that would reveal exactly 100 years of his grandfather's award-winning achievements.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a thick fog under a string of shots from field guns and machine guns".
He then rushed forward to the battle line and with "the greatest courage" led the front before rushing to use field guns alone and crippling three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "something I knew I wouldn't live for but it was a very humble act".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid wreaths after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honoured to be part of this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that many people will give".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine this, you've been up all night watching a crowded Bellator 206 only to be denied a prime-time spot.
The ticket from San Jose contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the British audience was stunned when the coverage turned into Peppa Pig.
Some feel unappreciated after staying up early on the special day of the fight.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to children's cartoons as "an annoying joke".
"It's a government policy, that at 6 a.m. the content is not suitable for airing, so it's replaced with children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yeah".
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would be revising their schedule to take into account the UK audience in the future.
"I think if we think about replaying, I think we might be able to get it done", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock there on a Sunday morning and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, in the transition, there's a lot of text back and forth and it's not all educational.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical error.
No, it's a government matter.
Trust me, next time it won't happen.
We're going to cut it down to five fights from six fights -- as we normally do -- and we're going to try to avoid over-broadcasting to the fans, and we're doing it.
This is a bad situation".
Tom Daley feels 'lowly' about his sexuality issues
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a low self-esteem because of his sexuality issues - but that gave him motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old says he didn't realize until he entered high school, that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the right of gay people to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as the outcasts on Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "less than" everyone else she grew up with because "it's not socially acceptable to like men and women".
She says: "To this day, those feelings of being inferior, and those feelings of being different, have become the real things that give me the power and the strength to succeed".
She wanted to prove she was "something", she said, so she wouldn't disappoint everyone when they found out about her sexuality issues.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a prominent LGBT campaigner and used her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries not to discriminate against homosexuals.
She said she spoke because she felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "shocked me".
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years her senior last year, and he said the age gap wasn't a problem.
"When you have so many problems at such a young age" - she went to her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she says it's very difficult to find someone of the same age who has the same ups and downs.
The couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I should win the gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than just winning an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had already gotten tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'You're not going to sit in the front row Dad,'" she said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, finally I admitted that he was invincible", she said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of crowds at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling than that", he said.
It also inspired her first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - which has since merged with her in her preparation for the Olympics and still makes her groan.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast that airs on Sundays at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson switched roles while on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American golfer Phil Mickelson will set the record on Sunday as he plays in the 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has had to switch roles to avoid an unpleasant achievement.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was booked by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball and four-team game on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually does for the United States, the five-time major winner divides his time between being a cheerleader and doing his game on the range, hoping to fix what has been bothering him.
Never the most straight-hitting golfer even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old was not suited to the extremely strict course at Le Golf National, which routinely handed out long and harsh penalties for every miss.
And for his own field, it wasn't scary enough for Mickelson, in game nine on Sunday, facing highly accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If this American golfer, starting 12 singles games four points behind, starts with a hot start, then Mickelson's match will prove to be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, not because he could tell you much else.
"He really understood his role today, patted me on the back and hugged me, and said he would be ready for the match tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He was so confident.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's given so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagine the others, but that's the way it's played out and that's the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played, on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that would never match the height of his individual record.
Mickelson bagged 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, though Furyk said his presence brought some unspoken things to the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a cool guy in the team room", she explains.
"I think the younger players are having fun with him, this week too, which is quite fun to watch.
He gives a lot, more than just playing".
European captain Thomas Bjorn knew the great advantage could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, learned from experience that someone who leads big enough to his final singles match in the Ryder Cup can easily be a rough ride.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, with team captain Seve Ballesteros holding a five-point lead over the Americans, but had just hit the finish line with their nose by the thinnest margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we got a big advantage at Valderrama; we got a big advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but just recently", said Bjorn, taking a picture, after watching the Class of 2018, win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you'll enter a really boring match.
Go out there and do the right thing.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that goal is to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've been saying for a long time, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side - the greatest players in the world".
Pleased to see the players playing on the hard course, Bjorn adds: "I could never have done this on my own.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players will advance, and this is a different thing to do.
It's nice to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there playing individually, then your full potential as a golfer is put to the test.
That's the message you have to get to all the players, bring out the best in you for tomorrow's game.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of himself".
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his players to play better individually than they did as a team, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself had been on both ends of the turnaround on the final day of the big game, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before ending up with a defeat when Europe performed the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, was uniting his players into the final days.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start it fast like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When the momentum goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We also put together a roster and put people in different ways that we feel, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow".
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the fight against Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other Europeans topping the rankings.
"I went with this group of people in this order because I felt I could close all the roads", Bjorn said of his single choice.
New German warships suspended again
The newest German Navy patrol vessel should have entered service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era battleship, but the ship will not be there until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class patrol vessel, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems have disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
The ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as several stealth technologies, such as radar deactivation, infrared, and acoustic locks.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - it should be possible to use the latest patrol vessel for two years away from its home port.
However, the continuous delays meant that the advanced warship - which was said to allow Germany to show off its power overseas - would be obsolete by the time it began to enter service, Die Zeit noted.
The ill-fated F125 patrol boat made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return of the ship, but German media cited a number of significant software and hardware flaws that rendered the warship useless if used for combat missions.
The software flaw was significant because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half the workforce on the older Bremen-class battleships.
It was also known that the ship's weight was so excessive that it would reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the broken hardware, the cost of producing the entire project - including training the crew - was also a problem.
It is said to have risen to a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problem that has plagued the new patrol vessel has become particularly important given recent warnings of a reduction in German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "out of ships with dispersal capabilities".
The official said that over time the problem is growing, as the old ships are no longer in use and no replacement ships have been provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class patrol boats could join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study was conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands to uncover how bats use the landscape in their food-hunting.
It is hoped that this discovery will shed new light on the unique behavior of these flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common pipistrelle and sopranos as well as the long-eared brown bat and the Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
A sound expert analyzing all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's calls and which species are engaged in what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports are created to create landscape-scale images of their detailed behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes this result will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine what benefits are gained from habitat management work such as grasslanding and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout England have declined sharply in the last few centuries.
The bat is threatened by construction and development work that affects nesting and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as sticky paper used for bat traps and chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, because of its habit of hunting at night, its ears are more useful than its eyes in capturing prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to precisely locate insects and obstacles in their flight paths.
The NTS, which is responsible for the upkeep of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, is deeply concerned about bats.
It has ten trained experts, who routinely conduct surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes rescue efforts.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only nature reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Plantation manager David Thompson says the plantation is a good area for bats.
"Here in Threave, we have a good area for bats", he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and all good habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and at other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive".
He stressed the importance of bat screening before performing maintenance on the property, because unconsciously there is the possibility that the destruction of one breeding nest could kill up to 400 females and young bats, which would likely wipe out the entire local population.
Protecting bats and killing, harassing, or disturbing them, or destroying their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we still don't know what the fate of their populations is".
Ronaldo, who denies rape charges, is preparing a lawyer to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape claims against him "fake news", and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was then alleged to have paid her by giving her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers a few hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no. I was just like,
What they're saying today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's the usual thing.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the actor added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "reports of unacceptable suspicions in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said he would seek compensation as "a moral damages amount commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to a report filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" who disappointed only "one percent".
The document says that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but it was on the basis of mutual desire.
Mayorga also said she went to the police station and had a visa for her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to settle the matter out of court because she felt "fear of retaliation" and feared "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman said she is now trying to overturn the peace settlement because she is continually traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time the attack was alleged, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the loss of carmakers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it loses its status as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that "concerning" Toyota, the UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of a delayed border if no deal is reached would hurt Brexit in terms of labour costs.
The plant in Burnaston - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported throughout the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a shutdown of production at our plants", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other British carmakers have expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main issue associated with what the carmakers said was the risk to the supply chain if there was no Brexit deal.
Toyota's production lines are run on the principle of "on-time" production, with spare parts coming in every 37 minutes from both suppliers in the UK and the European Union for custom-built cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, a company spokesman said, and thus production would be halted.
Clark said Chequers Theresa May's plans for future relations with the EU were "calibrated properly to avoid border checks".
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will also allow what I'm saying not only to enjoy success at the moment, but for us to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The proof, not just from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we really need to be able to continue what has been a very good supply chain".
Toyota cannot say how long production will be halted, but what is clear in the long run, warns that the cost increase will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and will eventually hurt in terms of labor costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union manager for Unite at the factory, says that his members are increasingly worried: "In my experience, once this job is gone, it will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a clear and sensible plan for our future relationship with the European Union".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be rescheduled, the White House says
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred another week" as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump would fire the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller's freedom, has fueled speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed using the telegram to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was again postponed to avoid clashes with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which subsequently delayed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, is appearing on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for the meeting has not been set, maybe this week, I can see that it is good to postpone it to another week also considering the other things that happened in the high court.
But we'll just watch and I always want to get the latest news to the press".
Some journalists will dispute that statement: Sanders hasn't held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the rarity of the meetings was not due to dislike of TV reporters "who try to attract attention", although, he said: "I don't agree with the fact that they try to attract attention".
Then he proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press be improved.
"The president is doing more live Q&A sessions than any previous president", he added without citing evidence: "We've seen those numbers".
The meeting will still happen, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions in person, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often and you've seen us do a lot of it in the last few weeks and it's going to replace press conferences when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump routinely asks questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting high-ranking officials.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president is likely to show his reasons, making a free and sometimes bizarre appearance before a gathering of reporters.
The health secretary wrote to EU workers at the Scottish NHS about concerns over Brexit.
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and hope they will still be working here after the Brexit issue.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent the letter in less than six months until Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has committed to cover the costs of applying for permanent status for EU nationals working in the public service who are relocated.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal were still ongoing, approaching a decision expected this autumn.
But the British government has also prepared for the possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be very upsetting to all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we would very much like you to stay".
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in the 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the end of the game.
"He came to the edge of the field and fainted there", Reed said.
The coach and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and taking him away for further evaluation.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has been released from the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/degree of injury sustained" and the State of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, this redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He collected a total of five tackles on Saturday before being ejected from the game, bringing his total tackles during the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, with the extra money to be used to help homeless people under the new Tory plan.
This move will slow the pace of success of the Corbyn movement in attracting young voters.
This stamp duty increase will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department estimates it will raise up to £120 million a year- to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - with the extra money to be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
This move will be seen as an attempt to slow the pace of Jeremy Corbyn's successful efforts to attract young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting high incomes.
Increased stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional money that will boost the Government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The surcharges - which are an addition to the current sealing fees, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second home purchases and rental purchases - could be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to rise to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-British residents, causing prices to soar and making it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many affluent areas of the country - usually in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a week after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help more young people have their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to ignore quotas for affordable housing in order to fix the "housing shame" in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of exciting housing reform proposals, including rent control and ending "guilt-free" evictions.
He also wants to give the council more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I promised I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it is not right for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, to buy houses as cheaply as hard-working British residents.
For many the dream of owning a home has become something very distant, and the mistreatment of the homeless remains real".
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the Scotland team'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "primary ambition" was to become Scotland manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who are currently third in League One, three points clear of the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I want to defend my country as a player.
I got the B cap and that was it", Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up and used to watch the Scottish team in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it was always something that attracted me to come back.
But the opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management".
Sunderland managers before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of big names at clubs of that size, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the current success will be measured by 'can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, there is no doubt that it is in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task to be there, but I'll probably only see myself as a successful person here, if I can bring this club back there".
Ross's career in team management lasted just three years, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton, and spending 15 months on the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to third place, and turned St Mirren from relegation to championship winner the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"This may be the crossroads I have to go through", he sighed as he took over Alloa.
"I really believe management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I'm fine, I make a living in a reasonable way, and I enjoy some normal things.
But playing can be difficult.
You have a lot to go through every week.
I still experience it in terms of the pressure of the job, but in terms of management it feels fine.
I always wanted to lead something and now I'm doing it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever had in my entire adult life".
You can hear the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30th, on Radio Scotland between 12 and 1pm BST.
The survey found that the best time to drink beer is 5:30 on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted the income of pubs in Britain that are struggling to survive, but it has put more pressure on the restaurant chain.
Figures show the pub and bar group saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant revenue fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant, who compiled the figures, said: "The bright sunshine and England's longer-than-expected World Cup participation mean July will follow the same pattern as the previous June, where pub revenues rose by 2.8 per cent, barring restaurants that suffered heavy setbacks.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June will worsen in July.
Sales in pubs and bars that sell drinks have so far been strongest compared to those in restaurants that are down.
Pubs that sell food also suffer from the heat of the sun, though not as badly as restaurant operators.
Looks like people are just out for drinks.
Sales at all managed pubs and bars that sell drinks rose 6.6 percent for the month, with those that sell food down 3 percent".
Paul Newman, an RSM leisure and hospitality analyst, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors regarding outdoor market sales.
Not surprisingly, the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales will be painful on top of the ongoing cost pressures.
The long summer should not come at a time when food operators are having a bad time, and time will tell whether the fairly good temperatures we already enjoy in August will provide the little needed respite".
Total sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, an industry sales monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sectors in the UK, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is an industry benchmark that can no longer be ignored.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
Surveys reveal that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of the "fake Insta" page
This news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show to their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - set up social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to photo-sharing sites on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about his posting of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a "main" account that has been cleared to show to parents, while also having a personal account.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager asking others to "rape me".
A study by Digital Consciousness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them claiming to have a personal account.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan says: "It's upsetting so many teenagers who are trying to create online spaces that their parents and teachers can't find".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice for the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of governors.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from his extensive experience at international level over the last few decades.
"Eilidh is well respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we believe that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by having her on the board", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I act as a voice for the athletes and I hope to be able to really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American athlete, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among her four Olympic gold medals total and is now the BBC's expert on the subject, is now unable to walk after suffering a brief ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said that only time would determine whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was a very tiring job to recover fully, to learn how to walk again, and to do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows has divided the online world
Breast pump companies have divided the online world with an ad comparing nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent-wearable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a joke music video to show the freedom this new pump gives a mother to express herself.
Four mothers danced in a cow-stall following a song that included lyrics like: "Yes, I blush myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you're not paying attention, this isn't a stinger, this is my breast".
It goes on to say, "Pump out, pump out, I feed them baby, pump out, pump out, I milk my woman".
However, the advertisement, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it's a "terror" for the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, cows must also become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless their babies are stolen from them within a few days of giving birth, someone wrote.
Elvie's breast pump fits perfectly in the breastfeeding bra.
Another commented: "The trauma is understandable for both mother and baby.
But why not use it to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have to take care of their babies?"
Another added: "An advertisement that loses its meaning".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "funny".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it if I was still breastfeeding.
Squeezing makes me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad was a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It is a product of genius", one wrote.
Another commented: "It is a pleasant advertisement aimed at moms who are bullying (often in their workplace or toilet) and who feel like "cows".
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all feel like they're dancing with a hidden pump tucked inside their bra.
The concept behind this campaign came from the insights of many women who were breastfeeding who said they felt like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, without wires or tubes and fits inside a breastfeeding bra, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while squeezing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother comments: "The Elvie pump is a pioneering product worthy of a convincing and provocative launch.
By equating the image between expressing women and cows we want to pump milk and all its challenges, and show it in a way that is entertaining and fun with the full freedom that the new pump presents.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
At London Fashion Week, a mother with two children performed on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Move Quietly to Camps on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained is rising despite monthly border crossings remaining unchanged, partly due to harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it difficult to raise children with sponsors.
Basically, most of the sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants, and they're afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to save the children.
The risk increased in June, when the federal government announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to hand over fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor a neglected minor.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of sponsored groups are in this country illegally, and most of them are mean foreigners.
So we keep hunting those people", Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of the previous standard of 60 days, said the shelter workers.
Most of them appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those deemed unworthy of assistance would be deported immediately.
The longer children are held, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or escape attempts, shelter workers and system reports have received in recent months.
Lawyers say the concern is growing at larger facilities like Tornillo, where signs of a struggling child tend to be overlooked, given its size.
They say that moving children to a campsite without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends can exacerbate the trauma they have already fought so hard for.
Syria calls on the 'occupying forces' of the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war has now entered its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally occupying Syrian soil, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with as appropriate".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem asserted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than a million people fleeing their homes.
He asserted that Damascus will continue "fighting this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory" of terrorist groups and "illegal foreign military presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, specifically training and influencing Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces that are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem insisted that they should return immediately, and he blamed "several Western countries" for "spreading an extraordinary fear" that encouraged refugees to move further away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return", he said.
"They politicize what should be a matter of utter humanity".
The European Union and the United States have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for further political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevents a massive offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem insisted that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and raised hopes that military action would target mujahideen including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly hold the first meeting of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war law for Syria and pave the way for a general election.
Moualem laid out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, insisting that the panel's work should be limited "to reviewing the current articles of the Law", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Trump would win the general election again in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers hoped, impeachment and scandal ended his presidency prematurely.
No one doubts, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
So far, there are no signs of fatigue for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC's have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped cable TV's ratings with 3.5 million viewers on prime-time nights.
"It's a spirit that attracts people because it's something that's not understood", says Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about the cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol bombing.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
He remembered taking a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to give his vote to Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh,'" Miss Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in a mess.
Certainly, unlike other TV shows, the storyline emerging from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and revive the global economy.
Turn it off, a luxury that only the most privileged audience can experience.
Still, it's not just being a knowledgeable citizen when at six o'clock you find yourself watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "background" sources for his book "Fear", wearing Paul Manafort's $15,000 camel-skin bomber jacket ("thick-clothed with vanity", quotes The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' gruesome description of Trump's anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of the policy he's making is making it look like a reality show that entertains you every night", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the show's cast and the Trump daily storyline (choosing to be hostile to the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

He's not able to get himself off, not with Brett Kavanaugh set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and then the Supreme Court on his balance.
"I remember when we were doing all the crazy shows that day and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right".

A lot of outside money floods the toughest part-time election race in the White House.
It's only natural that Pennsylvania 17 gets a flood of money, thanks to congressional redistricting that puts two candidates in the same seat race.
Pittsburgh's recently reorganized district ran for Rep. Conor Lamb of the Democrats - who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb ran against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps with the new Pennsylvania 17th district.
These maps were rearranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally Republican.
The competition for Pennsylvania's new 17th district has resulted in large campaign funding between the major party's financial arm, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became increasingly well known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March general election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been held by Republican officials for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have put the Democrats slightly ahead.
U.S. Considering Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Withdrawing
Diplomats have confirmed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and booked a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a department spokeswoman, disclosed in a statement earlier this month.
However, penalties are only considered for El Salvador, which has received about $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hurt the Central American country and increase unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings were underway, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on the same meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials insisted that they wanted the conference to continue, in order to effectively end the consideration of sentencing for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to deliver a speech at the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the government's import at the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing with them a new rebuke or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate presented by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations of this unclear situation.
Their statements were corroborated by outside analysts close to the government and also spoke about this unclear situation.
Study Stories from the Year
Another shocking story was the report by special counsel Robert Mueller about the possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, which is now very important evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's report also discusses his investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in attacking our general election.
If Congress switches hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable, just as he prepares to go before the voters again, and perhaps eventually become a judge of his peers.
So there's still a lot to do, and I don't mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump's administration is inevitable - or his equality in Europe.
There are choices we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, provided the West stood against him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the chance to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The beginning of history centers along such a point of divergence, and the march of democracy that is accelerated or delayed is inevitable.
Now Americans are facing some of these tipping points.
What are we supposed to do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversaw the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since the paper reported that, last year, he suggested that we secretly film the president and argued that he was not fit to be president.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was not accurate.
"How do we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is brought before the Supreme Court despite strong allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we going to give a half-time vote to a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail that test, democracy will deteriorate in the long run.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a Sabbath candle on a table with a swastika.
By leaving me that legacy, how could I lose hope for our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is feeling optimistic ahead of the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, armed with a win over Austria, following a good draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will strengthen their position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans out of the first season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that as a stepping stone to a bigger future.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal is a great team", said the 31-year-old.
"In this match we are confident we can get something and go with a point.
In the end, we might be able to do it but, we think, the draw might be a fair result.
In the first half, they may have been better but in the second half, we got back up and became a better team.
As of Thursday, tonight is another big European day.
We were hoping to bag three points even though it would be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but, with the support of the fans behind us, I am sure we can go ahead and get a positive result.
Last year, we had a difficult time, because of what happened with my injury and the changes in the club itself but now there is very good hope in this club.
The squad is great and the kids are really enjoying it. It's a good practice.
Let's hope we can grow, put the past behind us and achieve success".

Although it turns out that the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study discussed the cost of long-term care with their partners.
Only 10 percent of them said they discussed this with their children.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's no way to start the discussion", says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
This is where it's time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your own family for treatment if you do not first make your wishes known.
Discuss with your counselor and your family where and how you get treatment, for your choice will play a big part in determining the cost.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can certainly help you to see how to pay for these expenses.
The financing you choose for long-term care includes traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid cash insurance policies that cover these costs or self-insurance with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Show your legal documents: Facing a legal debate that is stalled.
Appoint your health care authority immediately, someone you trust to ensure your health care and ensure that your wishes are carried out by professionals when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, a power of attorney in your financial matters should also be considered.
You should choose someone you trust to handle all your financial decisions, besides making sure that you pay your bills if you cannot afford them.
Always remember every little detail: Imagine your aging parent in an emergency and on his way to the hospital.
Are you prepared to answer questions about your medication or allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready to answer.
"It's not just the finances that play a big role, but who's the doctor?" asked Martin.

A man shot with a wind gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a wind gun on his way home from a party.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot multiple times in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The shooting incident was described by officers as occurring at approximately 02:30 BST, and was described as a "random act".
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The injuries sustained by the victim were not life-threatening and a number of witnesses have been brought forward by the police.
Earthquake and tsunami strike Indonesia
The devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday killed at least 384 people, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The disruption of communications made it difficult for aid workers to get information from Donggala County, a region north of Palu city that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are some key facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala, meanwhile, is a district stretching more than 300 km (180 miles) from the coastline on the northwest island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administrative region under the province, was estimated to have 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
The mainstay of the economy in South Sulawesi province is fishing and farming, especially along the Donggala coast.
However, the presence of nickel mining also plays an important role in the province, although it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, across the coast of Sulawesi.
Recorded in the last 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a tsunami disaster and hundreds of homes in Donggala were leveled.
In 1996, nine people died in the disastrous tsunami in western Donggala.
Seismically, Indonesia lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire and therefore earthquakes will occur regularly.
The following are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: December 26, Indonesia was hit by a major earthquake, precisely on the west coast of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of those deaths were in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of similarly powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
On Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were reported dead.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami on the southern coast and killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
The death toll was over 1,100.
2010: An island in the Mentawai archipelago off Sumatra was also hit by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that instantly devastated dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya district, Aceh, also suffered a shallow earthquake and caused devastation, as well as panic among people who remember the devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunami that killed in 2004.
Although this time there was no potential tsunami, more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of the buildings.
In 2018: Lombok, dubbed as a tourist island, also suffered a major earthquake that killed more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The quake shattered thousands of buildings and temporarily displaced thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's stepson arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, blocking reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Police report released Saturday.
According to police reports, when an acquaintance of a woman tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, he took the phone from the woman.
Palin was handed over to Mat-Su Pre-trial Detention, with a $500 fine without bail, as reported by KTUU.
As reported by news networks, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, claiming "innocent, almost certainly" when asked about her defense.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could get her a one-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine.
In addition, he was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
For Palin, this isn't the first time she's been sued.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to file a report of the alleged assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence reporting, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, which were also related to the incident.
Her boyfriend accused her of spitting in her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received a rebuke from veterans groups for associating her son's violent behavior with PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of victims dead
On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a powerful earthquake that killed at least 384 people.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which could trigger a tsunami, has destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications are down, and the death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake then struck central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing the horror of the moment were widely circulated on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in Palu city at the time, when the tsunami tore through the beach.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the rare death penalty for a suspect in a terror attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terror attacks in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare execution and one that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly committed assault by crashing a rented truck from Home Depot into pedestrians and cyclists on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify this death sentence, prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, based on a plea of will to impose the death sentence, filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both charges allow for the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in the commission of racketeering, which is typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of assault and attempted destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutor, the attack required "substantial planning and early maturity", as Saipov's crimes were portrayed as being carried out with "hideous, cruel, and uncivilized" intent.
It was revealed in the statement of will, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, danger, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
The five victims in the incident were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York dropped its last death penalty lawsuit.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of killing two drug suppliers, was finally sentenced to life in prison.
The last execution in New York federal court was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse as the days and months passed after the attack.
When questioned by investigators, he said that he felt happy with what he had done, the police said.
Saipov also revealed to the authorities that the attack he carried out was inspired by ISIS videos he watched from his phone, as the indictment states.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts against him.
David Patton, a federal public defender representing Saipov, expressed "clearly disappointment" at the prosecutor's decision.
"In our view, the decision to execute rather than accept a guilty plea to life imprisonment without parole would only prolong the trauma of those involved in the incident", Patton said.
Earlier, Saipov's defense team had pleaded with the prosecutor not to impose the death sentence.
NIGEL FARAGE is in charge of Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage called for 'moving the people's army' today in a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should 'feel the heat' of Eurosceptics - because one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested that they get involved in negotiations with the EU.
A supporter of the conservative group, Peter Bone, told a street rally in Birmingham that Britain 'should have gotten out' by now had Farage served as Brexit Secretary.
However, the challenges May faces in reconciling her divided seat have been underlined by Remain Tories who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep his Chequers compromise plan on track despite the onslaught of Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allied countries stressed that he would be pushed forward to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the bad reaction - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to decide between his proposed package and 'chaos'.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave crowd in Solihull that he wanted to 'get rid of the Chequers.
The proposal was that Farage should appoint a partner to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"If he's still in charge, we'll be out by now", he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I'm ready to stand for Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers".
He said, while showing his opposition to the EU: "We don't fight in the world war to be subservient.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.'
Bone dismissed the suggestion that public opinion has potentially caused change since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the thinking of the British people has changed and wants a fixed condition is completely untrue".
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who also joined the mass rally, told reporters: 'Simply put, I want to say: Prime Minister, listen to your people.
Chequers is not popular with the public, while the Opposition will not vote for him, because it is not popular with our party and activists who are really going out into the streets and making us elected in the first place.
Our request, put down the Chequers and start listening to us.'
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage said that the politicians' demonstrations should be faked in order to 'feel the heat' if they want to overturn the 2016 referendum results.
"At this moment, the most valuable thing is the trust between us - the people - and our political parties", he said.
'They tried to deny Brexit and here we are today, reiterating to them that 'we will not let you do that'.
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: 'I want you to make our political faction, which is preparing to deny Brexit, feel the heat too.
We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who will win us over at Brexit and will never give up until there is an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the Remainers' mass move through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A line of activists appeared to be waving Tories Against Brexit banners after launching their line this weekend.
A Labour colleague, Lord Adonis, mocked the Conservative group over the security issue of their party app as the conference opened.
"These are the people who told us that they could take over the IT system and all the technology for Canada, anything, for an anti-friction border, in the framework of unlimited free trade in Ireland", he added.
What a funny show.
There is no good Brexit at all,' he added.
Warren is planning to make a serious fuss about the presidential race.
United States. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "squash the presidential race" after the November election moment.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic party declared its future at city hall in western Massachusetts, on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against state GOP representative Geoff Diehl, the vice chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he has been singled out as an opponent of Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's meeting in Holyoke was the 36th with his constituents, held in a town hall format since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked him if he had any plans to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to enter the circle of Washington to repair our broken government, and that included women's time at the top".
The arrest of the shooter Sims, an LSU player
On Saturday, Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced the arrest of a suspect in the shooting that led to the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. in a ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, where a man identified as asking for help as seen in the footage.
Friday morning, Sims, 20, was shot and found dead near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
During questioning, Simpson admitted to being at the scene, holding a firearm, and shooting it at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any significant resistance and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior, grew up in Baton Rouge, that's Sims, has played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and is averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after the team concedes victory over Sebastian Vettel
It all became clear when Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton in Saturday's qualifying race which would bring the Mercedes team's command of the race to a major role.
From pole, Bottas had a good starting position and almost left Hamilton as he maintained his position in the first two turns and drew Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to go into the pits and let Hamilton move into the density at the end of the crowd, something that should have been very decisive.
Mercedes entered the pits one lap later and exited after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to drive after a few races which showed the Ferrari driver's reluctance to leave the interior empty at the risk of holding after a double move to hold in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started at the back of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led on most of the race as he held off the tyre changes to target a quick finish and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth place.
He finally got into the pits on lap 44 but was unable to improve his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen eventually took fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man who let me.
The team has done an incredible job of having one two, Hamilton said.
That's some bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday by urging her not to leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about sexual assault charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver the statement Ford delivered before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on what was going on in the senate that showed people who were "evil and filthy and dishonest".
"Something that could happen and wonderful things that have been happening over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and ugly and dishonest", he said.
"When you see the leak and the leak and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I did not do it".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't leak it".
All right, hold on a second.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak", he added, to impress the senator.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and it had leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leaks were from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, Hill said.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as he requested".
But his refusal seemed to be disapproved of by the president, who commented during a rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, that's really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who became accused of sexually abusing three women, the president was impressed by the assumption that Democrats were using the charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to seize power in various ways.
You see the crime, the revulsion, they don't care who they hurt, they have to march for power and control,
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's defeat in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the home game 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants took a two-goal lead after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home side to a tie before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to catch up and finally get a lead to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning three games in the previous.
The opener from Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 of a pass given by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford delivering the pass as Beauvillier managed to double the lead four minutes later.
In the crowded opening period, Sullivan brought the home side back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt was the passing man for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead at the first interception when he kicked the second goal of the night late in the first period.
The hosts rallied and Bouchard once again balanced their position with a power play goal in the 27:37 mark.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time at the end of the game in the second period and he secured a victory with his team in the middle of the fifth during the final period.
The Giants, who have so far suffered four defeats from their five games, are at home to face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die to ensure hundreds of passengers on board survive the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after his death while ensuring a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a massive earthquake hit the Sulawesi Islands on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continued to shake the region and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony the Great refused to leave his post in a shaking control tower at Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport, Palu.
He chose to stay on to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower as he felt it begin to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Aviation Navigation Service, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could save hundreds of lives, ABC Australia reported.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Borneo to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter made it to the Hammer.
"We are all saddened to hear this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the National Disaster Management Agency made access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities difficult.
"The casualties are believed to be still increasing as many bodies are still overwhelmed by rubble and many others are unreachable", said spokesman for the national disaster management agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching six meters had made the Hammer a spearhead leading to a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is carrying a body.
Clean water is becoming scarce.
Minimarket everywhere looted"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It's been a tragedy, but it could get worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?
Indonesia earlier this year was also hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini reports one person missing after plane crashed in lagoon
The airline operating the flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia reports one person has been missing, after previously being told 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday afternoon that it could not identify a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to find the man.
The airline did not respond promptly to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew after the plane hit water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline delivered the remaining six passengers to the hospital on Saturday, and they are all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both claimed the plane landed in the lagoon around the runway.
Some witnesses feel the plane has overrun the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in at a very low altitude.
"That's a really good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to get waist-high water through the emergency exit on the sunken plane.
He delivered the flight attendants panicked and screaming, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said fishermen working nearby around the repaired dock also assisted rescues using rubber boats to ferry people ashore before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate 111 people have died in airline-registered accidents over the past two decades but none involving Air Niugini.
Analysts uncover a timeline of women burned alive at night
The arrest indictment came on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used cell phone recordings to gather various movements made by the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was at the same location as Chambers on the night of his death, in contrast to the defendant's previous statements, reported Clarion Ledger.
When the cell phone data showed the defendant was at the same location as Chambers during that time, he argued that he was at the time with his friend Michael Sanford, police eventually asked Sanford for an explanation.
Sanford attended the hearing on Saturday and he testified that he was out of town on the day of the incident.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck the night of the crime, Sanford said he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency conveyed by Tellis was his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks before the victim's death.
Cell phone records indicate they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, sometimes Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He's eliminated the victim from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing statement on Sunday.
The judge stated he hoped the trial would lead to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the spirit of hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wanted to challenge the genre's negative view by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, originating from Bristol, claimed the hip hop movement moved away from its political origins and tackled social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and popularize the spirit of hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through several artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
The other black guy?!
NY nanny sues couple for assault after issuing racist messages
A New York nanny sued a couple for discriminatory assault after receiving an indirect message from a mother who complained and stated that she was "another black person".
The couple denied that they were racist, and considered it more like "extremism".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her anxiety when she realized that her new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day on the job in 2016.
"No more black people", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Anyway, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, the "unpleasant" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, stating that they fired the nanny, who was a mixed African-American citizen, because she had done a bad job and she was expecting more from Filipinos, according to the New York Post.
Miss Maurice gets paid for one day's work and then drives home in an Uber.
Maurice now sued the couple for compensation for the dismissal, and demanded compensation of about $350 a day for a period of six months, in compensation for the babysitting work he had originally had to do, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do something like that", he told the Post on Sunday, then added, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple contested claims that they were racist, claimed that the workers who fired Maurice were justified in doing so, they feared that they could not trust him after he offended them,
"My wife has sent something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists, " Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But can you let your children be cared for by someone you've been in love with, even if it's just a mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's go".
As wrapped in a surprise, Plasco said his wife had just given birth to her baby two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"You'd go after someone in that condition?
That's not a good thing to do, the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has launched a quick crackdown on the couple on social media, blaming their attitude and logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers won't relate to talking bears, new newspaper reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born not long after the book was received, explained in the letter. It is very difficult to just talk about without knowing the position she is in, reading it for the first time before it is published.
It's funny to know as we know about the great success of Paddington".
Saying his father, who was a BBC cameraman before being inspired through writing a children's book with toy bears, was very optimistic about the results of his rejected work, he added the 60th anniversary of the book's publication felt "bitter sweet" after his father's death last year.
As for Paddington, whom he described as a "very important member of our family", he added his father was quite proud of his late success.
"He's a quiet man, and he's not a cocky man", he said.
"But because Paddington meant so much to him, it's like having a child who has achieved something: you're proud of them even though it's not all your effort.
I think that's how he sees Paddington's success.
Although it was a product of his own creation and imagination, he always paid tribute to Paddington himself.
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her over the phone.
Upon landing, his daughter was rushed to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but doctors were unable to save her.
"Nad made a quiet call to convey it was so bad. that he was highly unlikely to survive", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that he was going to die in the next two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you in a minute.
I'll be with you.
The medication doctors had given him to keep his heart beating slowly ran out and left his system.
He's been dead for a while now and the whole thing feels fatal.
I can just sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I couldn't whine, or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold it all".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - unaware of what she had been through.
"No one knows", he said.
"My head was bowed and tears were pouring down my face.
It's hard to explain, but on that flight I felt such a deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her".
Mourning women post cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones try to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspirational messages and numbers to call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she says.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son is a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always say that his smile lights up the atmosphere".
But, he stopped working before he died, as if he was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I was constantly worried about the long-term effects".
Mrs. Davis made these cards, "to let people know that there are other people out there that you can reach out to and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit and be quiet - you need to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't tell me if he was feeling sad or depressed or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents he didn't look them in the eye or anything".
She said that her death was a great trauma for them, but they had to go through it: "It divided the family.
It's what separates us.
But we have to get through it and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future was in doubt when the FBI began its investigation.
"I think if we really get something like what he's asking for - a time-limited investigation, limited in scope - we might be able to bring a little bit of unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "destroyed" in the middle of the deadlock of council decisions.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance to do anything is due to time.
The legislative elections are five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, they will be very weak in their chances of getting the person they want elected to sit on the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There's going to be an election in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It's not clear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors plummeted under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most of the North's defectors were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them back.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have intensified dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on the stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This comes after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work together on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, it is unlikely that we will unilaterally drop our weapons", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical", saying he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Opposition Party Chairwoman Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical" and said he was not temperamentally fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if a woman performs like that, they'll say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denies allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was highly emotional, several times nearly screaming and having difficulty speaking when discussing his family and his high school years.
He also blatantly denounced the Democrats on the committee, saying the charges against him were "unreasonable and coordinated character assassinations" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and with his attitude toward Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi has expressed objections that she will try to sue if she is approved, and if the Democrats gain more votes in the House of Representatives.
"I'll put it this way -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be not only on the Supreme Court, but on the court where he is now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the D.C. Superior Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the potential Kavanaugh ruling on the Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because she was seen as a conservative justice advocate.
At the impeachment hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is no time for someone who is hysterical and biased to go to court and expect us to say, 'Wasn't that great,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to deal with it.
It was an ethical spit, a rage for months and years, and she couldn't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, what do you think?"
She goes on to say, "I was really helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that she was angry and started crying, and she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I was angry".
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are released as an outlet for anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of my early work, in a male-dominated office, of a time when I was crying with inexpressible rage, was of an older woman - a cold manager I'd always been a little afraid of - grabbing my neck and dragging me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry, "he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they're successful".
Patricia Schroeder, a congresswoman from Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason for her not to run for president.
"It was not a thoughtful decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There are already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because he was late in the campaign, he was behind in fundraising, and so he vowed he wouldn't run unless he raised $2 million.
It was a battle that ended in defeat.
He found that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to a man only gave him $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he wondered.
When he made the announcement that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to those who supported him, frustration with the system that made fundraising so difficult and targeting voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - making it difficult for him to speak.
"You might think I'm too nervous, "remember Miss Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my grave?
"She was crying"?
How the U.S.-China trade rivalry might be good for Beijing
The opening shot of the US-China trade rivalry is so fierce, and while the battle is far from over, the standoff between the two countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
A very significant increase was imposed starting this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods entering the US via China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, recently imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has begged to be one-to-one with the US, and the world's second largest economy is not going to change anytime soon.
Telling Washington to back down is to follow their will, but publicly capitulating to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, the pressure of US trade competition can support China positively in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic movements in both countries is actually more dangerous than what observers have known before", said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for the return of refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and offers help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in his country was improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore them to their original state.
All the conditions are present because of the voluntary return of refugees to countries they had to leave because of terrorism and sweeping economic decisions that have targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime will receive help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they would not accept aid or conditional aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe secured the Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup defeating the U.S. team with final scores of 16.5 and 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its stake as Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who had been trying for most of the tournament, hit his tee shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, conceding his loss to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone throughout the round, becoming one of only four players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest placed player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the European with the overall win with a career-high 25.5 points at the tournament.
"I don't usually cry but I can't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have my stuff back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help", said Garcia, emotional after the European win.
He handed the responsibility to fellow countryman John Ram who beat legendary US golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"The incredible pride I felt, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record, a career Ryder Cup record.
Odd statistics by one of the greatest players of all time, having won 14 major titles under Jack Nicklaus alone.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to get fairway with the exceptions of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the entire tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk speaks after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we were making Europe difficult.
We had a fight.
Respect for Thomas.
He was a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're gonna reorganize, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're gonna move forward.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to pay your respects.
We lost the lead".
