Four members of the Kemerovo group arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to the postman, the police in Spain have detained the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevitch, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspects are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal group aged 27-57 who are mostly committing drug crimes.
In the Spanish province of Malaga, Mijas, a suspected leader of a criminal group was detained.
In Estonia, three men were arrested as suspects, one of whom, according to collected data, is a leading figure of a criminal association and two are members of a criminal association.
The data collected suggests that there was a clear distribution of tasks and roles within the criminal association.
The purpose of the activity of the criminal association was to commit drug crimes and thus earn criminal proceeds,” commented the head of the pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case, state prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out the possibility that the circle of suspects in this criminal case will increase," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have previously fallen into the law enforcement orbit, and some of them have been sentenced for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with his Spanish colleagues has played an important role throughout the investigation.
“International cooperation has become usual for us and this week’s operation shows the success of the cooperation,” said Attorney General Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said the arrests were preceded by a preliminary investigation that lasted a year and a half.
“In the first half of the week, long-term work was carried out and we simultaneously detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain,” he said.
Leis added that officials from the Central Criminal Police were assisting in the detention in Spain.
For years, we have had good contacts and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
"These arrests are another message to criminals that we can catch them from the other end of Europe," he said.
The information collected so far clearly indicates that the suspects could continue to commit new crimes while in detention, so the prosecutor’s office requested their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting his extradition to Estonia.
In this criminal case, real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings are conducted by the Central Criminal Police’s Office for Organized Crime and are headed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered to be the second important man in the Estonian criminal world after then-world leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevitch, from Kemerovo, emerged in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to deal with extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes at various hotels and demanded monthly roof fees from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and effective judgments confirm the effectiveness of the fight against organized crime.
For example, the latest judgments, eight defendants separated from the criminal case of the so-called Dikaev criminal association, from whom 80,000 euros of criminal proceeds were confiscated, or the verdict against nine persons in the fact that Igor Aleynikov established a criminal association in 2006 aimed at illicit smuggling of secret cigarettes and committing crimes related to human trafficking in the eastern Viruma and southern Estonia.
The amount of confiscated criminal proceeds amounts to approximately 71,500 euros.
Success in these criminal cases has been guaranteed by the fact that police officers exchange information with foreign counterparts and prosecutors exchange evidence every day and, if necessary, take action together in any EU country.
Civil rights group warns against traveling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri of the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
In a statement, the group said: “The NAACP ticket issued for the state of Missouri, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to be especially careful and extremely careful when traveling throughout the state, given the suspicious racial events of the whole race that have recently occurred across the state and are also highlighted here.”
According to the NAACP, the group was prompted to issue travel warnings both by the recent Missouri law, which makes it harder to win cases of discrimination, and by the fact that the state's law enforcers are targeted in an unequally large proportion by minorities.
“People’s rights are being violated.
They’re being pulled off because of their skin color, beaten or killed,” said Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri branch, to The Kansas City Star.
“We’ve never had so much complaints before.”
This is the first such warning the organization has issued against the US state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after running out of gasoline while driving through the state and was arrested by Missouri police without being charged with the crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General that shows that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped in the state than white drivers.
"The note is intended to make people aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared, whether it’s taking deposit or informing relatives that they’re going through the state.”
Based on the latest data from the FBI Hate Crimes Reporting Program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state 16th in the country for the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new law in Missouri that makes it harder for a company to file a lawsuit for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes for Texas and Arizona after those states adopted immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, as this, according to the ACLU, increases racial profiling.
Travel warnings are typically issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have begun to use this measure as a response to certain domestic laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what could everyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different hepatitis viruses - A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses provoke acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, with a malignant course, there is chronic hepatitis B and C, which can further develop into liver cirrhosis, i.e. redness of the liver and liver cancer.
Kuulo Kutsar, an epidemiologist at the Health Office, says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gray stool, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
From the last characteristic of the disease also comes the popular name of liver inflammation yellowness.
In children, hepatitis can proceed without signs of disease.
Different types of liver inflammation can be determined only on the basis of data from a laboratory study.
Acute hepatitis can transition to chronic hepatitis and proceed for decades without any signs of the disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his dangerous liver disease.
Hearing Kutsar identifies different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from the feces of an infected person to and from hands to food, surfaces, objects, entering the mouth, and by using drugs.
The risk group of infection with hepatitis A includes family members and caregivers, people with chronic liver disease, people who have sex with an infected person, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular, vaccination is recommended for people who travel a lot and are at risk for hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to comply with daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before eating.
Hepatitis B viruses are transmitted by contact with the blood of a sick person, by injection of drugs, by tattooing, by brushing, by using blood-contaminated household items (toothbrushes, shaving tools), by donating blood, by having sex with a person suspected of hepatitis, and from mother to fetus/newborn with hepatitis.
The risk group for infection with hepatitis B includes injected drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health workers, rescue workers and police officers who are exposed to blood and other body fluids, and travelers visiting countries with high incidence of hepatitis B.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, and in addition to people with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases, and people with diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: refraining from the use of foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other sharp tools and syringe needles, tattooing and scratching, and using condoms during infectious sex or avoiding sexual risk behavior.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunization scheme in Estonia and is free for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are transmitted by contact with the blood of a sick person, by injection of drugs, by tattooing, by brushing, by using blood-contaminated household items, by donor blood, by having sex with a person suspected of hepatitis, and from mother to fetus/newborn with hepatitis.
The risk group for infection with hepatitis C includes injectable drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health workers who are exposed to blood and other body fluids, rescue workers and police officers, HIV-infected people, and travellers visiting countries with high incidence of hepatitis C.
The preventive measures of hepatitis C are: abstention from the use of foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other sharp tools and syringe needles, tattooing and scratching, and the use of condoms in case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are transmitted by contact with blood and other body fluids, by needles contaminated with them, by sexual intercourse, and rarely from an infected mother to the fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D include chronic hepatitis B viral carriers and people who do not have immunity to hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses are transmitted via fecal-oral transmission through drinking water and food, including the consumption of little heat-treated animal meat, fish and seafood, donor blood, shared syringes, and from infected mother to fetus.
Travellers can get infected with hepatitis E in countries with high incidence.
The preventive measures for hepatitis E are to comply with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for a sick person.
Fruit and vegetables should be washed before consumption, avoid eating little heat-treated animal meat, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water, and refrain from using drugs.
While in the final round, competitors tried to knock the four-time Olympic champion off the track, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final and won with a time of 26.49,51.
Farah didn’t think long, pulling her husband, Tania, and the children onto the track after the finish.
This was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on track with them was wonderful,” Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for the fifth consecutive title in the 5000 meters and the 10,000 meters gold duel in London.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "The Lady in Gold. The Outstanding Story of the Masterpiece of Gustav Klimt, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer" plunges deeper into the cultural life of Vienna in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
More in depth in history.
The scary amount of information would be worn out, in a tougher cutoff, a narrower subject would allow the extraordinary story of the portrait promised in the title to gain more influence.
Currently, there are two books in one cover: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer depicted by Gustav Klimt and his painting “The Lady in Gold” and a much larger and more comprehensive history book on respected Jewish families and the German occupation with its follow-up in Austria.
The first third of the book takes place in the midst of the tumultuous cultural life of Vienna, and whoever has come to the capital of Austria can hardly imagine how life around the Ringstrasse was more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone in the Central café turned their heads when Klimt entered.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see a familiar name in the book, you feel a gram more cultural.
However, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city with the highest suicide rate in Europe and incurable syphilis does not seem to contribute to the development of the story.
Or still – every pair of brushes adds color to the cultural life of Vienna in the early 20th century.
Travel to the Soviet Union
During the last decades of the 19th century, the Jewish population in Vienna had grown explosively, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten inhabitants of Vienna were Jews.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married the Czech sugar giant Ferdinand Bloch twice and posed to Klimt for his famous paintings, her father's bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet was not drawn by all that glamorous life to which she belonged.
When looking at "The Lady in Gold", it is hard to believe that for the rest of her life this great lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his husband from Klimt, the last minute was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt's order at the time cost £4,000, a quarter of the price of a well-located country house.
The fact that in some portraits the master's love story with the model was suspected did not discourage the sugar magnate.
As for Adele, the only certain fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist that arose during the work continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O’Connor – The Lady in Gold.
The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt’s masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer’s portrait”, Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before working with Adele, Klimt had visited the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, and investigators believe that the brilliant mosaics of Empress Theodore seen there gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a mosaic painted there.
Klimt presented his "Lady in Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and around the same time (between 1907-1908) another golden painting "Kiss" was born.
Art historians have not noticed the similarity of the two women.
What does this have to do with Hitler?
"I think in memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his craft available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished that their family's Klimt collection would go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had made another portrait of Adele.
Also in her will (Adele left in February 1925) she asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four of Gustav Klimt's landscapes to the Austrian Gallery.
He inherited his jewelry to his sisters Maria and Louise.
A year after Klimt graduated from "The Mona Lisa of Austria", Adolf Hitler, 17, had tried to enter the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but failed while drawing.
Although sometimes Hitler's later antisemitism is thought to have been caused by the fact that Jewish professors did not accept him into the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jews.
In any case, the role of the Austrian Gallery referred to in the Maria Testament had changed considerably by 1939 – it had become important to find works favorable to the Nazi party from the rich Jewish art collections in Vienna.
Some of Adele's work at home also fit into Hitler's personal art property, but not Klimt's.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year litigation began between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauer heirs.
It should only be noted here that if "Kiss" is seen at Belvedere Castle in Vienna, Adele Bloch-Bauer's "Lady in Gold" must be seen at New York's New Gallery.
And before traveling to Vienna read the above book.
Even if you don’t plan to go to see Klimt’s works, because at least my emotions revolved around more Nazi and Jewish themes after closing the book than the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer sold for $135 million.
Not so much a portrait, but rather a family’s fate—and a very moving story.
It was noticeably facilitated by the Bauerite family tree mentioned at the beginning of the book.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In survival, Gold was very close to his own personal record of 200 meters swimming in 2.16,62.
Tippmark comes from a 17-year-old peak a week ago when the time at the Canadian junior championship was 2.16,58, reports Priit's Desert Swimming Blog.
Gold reached the final, the 10th place in the A-final.
In the final, he completed the distance with a time of 2.15,76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful peak.
From the Estonian record held by Alina Kendzior (2.15,13) Gold was separated by a little over half a second.
In the Estonian ranking of all time, Gold rose third and his fresh personal top mark is the fifth result of Estonia all time.
The young hopes for the future are still starting in the adult championships in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle and 200 m and 400 m complex swimming.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championship took place in Toronto, and Gold also made successful starts there.
He won a silver medal in 200 meters at a time of 2.03,22.
The last time this distance was flooded by the Estonian was in 2008.
In Estonia, only Estonian record-woman Elina Partõka swam this distance faster than Gold.
The Estonian who lives in Canada also won the bronze medal in the 100 meters freestyle with a great personal record and the new Estonian season with a peak score of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than him, swam this distance only one century faster.
He reached his personal peak margin in another 100 meters in the back swim, receiving a letter at the opening of the notification swim at 1.03,69.
In the longer distance, he reached only seventh place, swimming in the final 2.17,31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season in four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen their teeth
The holiday time is coming - that means relaxation for US President Donald Trump.
But since Trump has so far been one of the most vacationed presidents, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president plans to spend a 17-day vacation at a golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the presidential vacation began yesterday, Trump’s opponents have been talking about the vacation for a week.
They are causing Trump to rest too often.
It is customary for the president to spend weekends in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days.
For example, George W. Bush had been on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama was half less than Trump, just 21 days.
But Trump tends to forget things quickly.
Numbers of days after becoming president, Trump said in the "60 Minutes" broadcast that there would be no time for long vacations during his tenure, as there is a lot to be done.
He also expressed outrage over Barack Obama’s vacation three years ago.
The current president tweeted: “While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS cuts the heads of journalists.”
White House officials say a 17-day visit to a golf club is not a relaxation.
This is officially referred to as a work holiday, during which Trump has no time for reading or other activities.
There was also another reason for vacation.
The air conditioning system in the western row of the White House was replaced and all staff had to leave.
The Oval Cabinet and other Presidential offices are also located in the western seat.
"I don't think anyone of you would like to be in the West in August when there's 38 degrees and no air conditioning," White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
Where President Trump will spend the next 17 days can be seen in the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook – Don’t run for government unless you can’t tolerate criticism from voters
Our country’s father knew so much about the unfavorable media age.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to get him covered with everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism irritated him.
But he did not force his critics to remain silent.
Because in 1783 Washington said that “freedom of speech may be taken from us and, in the darkness and silence, we may be led to slaughter like sheep.”
This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to struggle to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates have blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who posted their opinions on his official Facebook page.
At the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against him.
The governor’s officials labeled the lawsuit null and the comments on the web were full of counter-reactions in the style of “Who is interested?”
“It’s just Facebook,” many said.
But that counts.
And that matters especially when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an astonishingly popular Republican governor in a predominantly democratic state.
His approval rate is the second best among the country’s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a thoughtless reacting whisperer.
He has ruled the state with a firm hand and remained firm in his principles.
Furthermore, he has used Facebook as his main tool to communicate with his voters, for example, presenting his bald head for the first time after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people from visiting the Governor’s Page – an official public forum managed by taxpayer dollars – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's behavior in an interview with The Washington Post, arguing that blocking comments was nothing but moderation.
But it’s too easy to paint a picture of internet trolls, spammers, or people full of anger.
The Post chatted with several real people Hogan blocked.
And that’s what they are – real people who interact with their chosen leaders. Teachers, business owners and pastors, not internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not ugly at all.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing Hogan Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Bowie in Maryland, did not incite anger, but rather hate crimes.
“I politely commented that I was disappointed because she has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news,” he wrote in the post.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same topic, someone immediately calls it an indifferent collective effort, instead of acknowledging that it’s a huge number of citizens concerned.”
What the governor’s official called a “targeted spam attack” would probably be called “public support” by others.
Facebook Age allows you to easily match posts by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It’s much cleaner than it used to be when workers had to be dispatched to collect newspapers with critical guidelines and burn them, or arrest protesters and silence them.
And that’s exactly what’s happening now, digitally.
Hogan is not the first government official to be criticized for hacking Facebook and other social media sites.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users, who have blocked his Twitter stream.
One of the first significant judgments on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that a speaker of the Loudoun County Supervisory Council violated the first amendment to the Constitution by blocking voters from her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) also visited Kentucky for the use of ACLU Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous writers twisted his way of conducting.
And even then, Washington had to bump into the chest with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, making Washington’s decisions landslide.
According to historical documents gathered as part of the online George Washington Letter Collection Project, he buried his cabinet under petitions criticizing his positions regarding friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he did not force them to remain silent.
Freedom of speech, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European player Ronan Rafferty hopes to be at home for the next three days as the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf courses.
The Northern Irishman, who was leading the last round last year on the neighboring Archerfield Lines tracks before subduing to Paul Eales, is passionate about the new venue and plays the role of the tournament ambassador instead of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I've seen the Renaissance Club being built, and now we're seeing the club shine in its full glory with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players see the track in its best shape, it's in brilliant condition.
Jerry has done a great job in building this place.
He is an avid supporter of the golf game and is proud of what he has achieved here.
This makes it possible to present the track perfectly.”
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending the title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
“It’s a very special feeling,” said a player at Southport.
“I couldn’t defend my Extremadura Open title because it was removed from my competition calendar a year after my victory.
It’s magical to come back to this place.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, last year’s victory was special for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a very special time that we will bear in our hearts forever.”
At home, Gary Orr also returns to the competition, who joined the senior European Tour earlier this year, when he turned 50.
This is her first event in Scotland since she participated in the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"To play at home is always a little more meaningful," said Orr, a man from Helensburg.
“You want to perform well, but you also feel extra stress.
I have the game again and played a fairly decent golf game.
I am satisfied with the progress so far.”
The trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the race, the rest of them are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir, and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free and parking costs £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All revenue will go to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesian gold-rich land
When Bardina Degei is cooking dinner, she doesn’t use the stove.
He even rarely uses the pot.
In a wooden house in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai regiment in Indonesia’s turbulent Papua province, a housewife puts a batad called nota directly on the fireplace.
After half an hour, the carbonated mug is taken from the fire and applied with unwashed hands eagerly to the skin.
Degei sits on the mud floor — he has no furniture — and there he also does his daily household tasks, such as washing his clothes with dull water from his neighbor.
The role of a shovel is fulfilled by a cage in a roofless room.
Since she is the youngest of her husband's four wives, she is not destined to take care of any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
But working late can be dangerous – most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are still soldiers here.
“No one dares to walk around the village after five o’clock at night,” he says.
This is a rare glimpse of life in Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elderly people were forced to raise their hands in front of occupying forces.
The movement prompted the liberation from Dutch supremacy toward its rage quickly pushed against the government of Jakarta, which still holds the region under its strong control, keeping foreign journalists and human rights observers away.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into Papua and West Papua, leaving the eastern part of the island to independent Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is both a remote and deserted place. To get here, you have to fly from Jayapur, the capital of the province, for 90 minutes to Nabire, and then take a boring five-hour journey by rental car.
There is no public transportation.
With approximately 19,000 inhabitants, the city consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo bars and covered by wave-shaped iron roofs whose rust has turned various shades into yellow-brown.
Very few Indonesians have travelled here, not to mention journalists, and almost no foreigners have visited here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Mee Pago papuas worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
"We weren't used to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to her colorful range of hand-woven turban, a dark blouse, and a bright shirt.
"Before that we only wore vegetable leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28% of people living below the poverty line, and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are among the worst in Asia.
It is also the gold land of Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of about 153,000 inhabitants in the size of New Jersey, is home to the world’s largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined around $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua boasts consumption timber stocks worth an estimated $78 billion.
But these riches are a source of suffering for the Papuas, as they cause the suffocating presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times found that Freeport paid local military personnel and military units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 per officer.
The Papuate’s attempts to secure greater autonomy threaten this golden hunter and are carelessly surrounded.
Human rights activists say more than 500,000 papuas have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killing of the Papua tribes in the mountainous countries in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by police in the region.
The Birsbane Archdiocese’s 2016 report “We Lose Everything” contains testimonies of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (specially common in rape and electrocuting, according to another report) and brutal repression of peaceful protests.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because such incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an investigator for Indonesia at Human Rights Watch.
The screws are tightened even more because the natural resources of Papua have caused the influx of new arrivals from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but the demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia’s populous islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Family diners in Java sell gado-gado with crisp and mixed vegetables, served with peanuts.
The locals cannot compete with them.
“Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables on a traditional market cheaper than local papas,” explains Abeth You, 24, born in Pania, who moved to the province’s capital Jayapura for work.
“Indigenous papuas – papua mommas [women] – are therefore losing their market share.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known among the people as Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter won on his way to Jakarta’s presidential palace from 29 of Papua’s 27 electoral districts, including Paniai.
But in Papua very little has changed and the locals feel deceived.
“Our hearts are broken since we voted for Jokowi in 2014 in the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes regarding the restoration of justice,” says You.
In fact, Paniai struggled with low status just two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang a Christmas song at the Enarotalis fire when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on the front lights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers insulted their voice tone and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers chased after children and beat them with their guns.
One of the soldiers shot the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was beaten so brutally that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, a nearby election commission building was set on fire and the next day things escalated further.
Around 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered to demand justice on a football field in front of the local police station and military control center.
They wore ceremonial hunting buses and performed a waita dance of the Papua honey pago tribe, during which they ran around and mimicked bird singing.
Some protesters began to throw stones on the police and the military.
"If the crowd shows more than three times the resistance, shoot them down," according to an official document seen by TIME magazine, but not issued to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, an elder of the Kego Koto district in the city of Enarotali (56), felt the threat and called for peace, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME magazine in his bright colours on the veranda of a wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who was the shooter, but says the moon came from the ranks of gathered soldiers.
“There was a lot of people, a lot of shootings,” he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was shot three times, according to his cousin who saw him be shot.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
“I saw that he was dead...I kissed him.”
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only guaranteed the security of his department as it was attacked.
“We have to protect ourselves if we are threatened with killing,” Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papuan police, said in 2015.
“It is a question of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and several were injured.
The news of the killings arrived in Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to address the abuses that took place in Papua.
“I want to resolve this case right away so that it never happens again in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism to address human rights crimes.
Immediately there were excuses.
“Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes," he said.
Speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, Wiranto, however, withdrew his words, saying that he had no intention of establishing a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be settled according to the law.”
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of human rights crimes in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999, said 11 human rights crimes have already been resolved in Papua, including the one in Pania.
The families of the victims of panic accepted such claims with dark confidence.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made,” Yohanes said.
“I am tired.”
He says he still lives in fear years later.
“I am afraid,” he says.
“I’m afraid the army will arrest me, I’m afraid I’ll be shot.”
His brother Yacobus affirmed the opinion that the people of Pania are afraid to unravel this incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army came to look for me," he says.
The shootings did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighboring Paniai district of Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when talks broke out between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while catching fish in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested on the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to police, villagers stoned police officers, who responded with warning shots.
But locals say a mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in great panic, afraid of revenge," Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital, told TIME magazine.
“I’ve been in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police involved and the withdrawal of the mobile police brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a problematic place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of deliberate development fuels the dissatisfaction of the honey, moni, dan and damal tribes living in the rotting middle highlands of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papuan Movement (VPL), a rebel army that, according to them, defends the rights of papuas by organizing accidental attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL leaders come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, the military, under the pretext of “defending the sovereignty of the country,” has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people over the past few years.
Some of them will never appear again.
Among the people of Papua, Pania is known as the "tragically forgotten place".
Poverty creates dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotalis is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is unavailable.
People grow all their food themselves – mostly potatoes, plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of women, each of whom is able to care for four or five potato fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten batats cost only 10,000 Indonesian Rupee (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between the original papuas and the new migrants, who have arrived in large numbers since the opening of new airlines at Nabire Airport, has worsened.
The few jobs that exist go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuas themselves often lack the capital or skills needed to run a competitive business.
“Young people are not interested in staying here because there are neither jobs nor money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Separation keeps the world’s eyes away from Papua.
There are strict restrictions on foreign media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua because "they did not follow appropriate practices" despite being granted a rare filming license.
Phelim Kine, deputy head of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division, said Jokov’s election promise to remove restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development has not been fulfilled.
“In Indonesia, journalists from the most disturbed eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua who try to report are threatened by new threats – visa rejection and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of a buffering gaze in the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua’s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific countries – Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands – urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “various widespread crimes” in Papua, including the shooting at Paniai.
The same countries have historically also supported the VPL.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the allegations, saying to journalists in Jakarta, “Indonesia still has a democratic order and freedom of the press, so evidence of human rights violations will be difficult to bury.”
Local people want more attention from foreign governments.
When an official Dutch delegation headed by the country’s human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar visited Jayapura on May 4, local people who attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous broke their silence, urging, “We want freedom.”
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the papuas do not believe they will again vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants to make Jokow realize that in addition to the fact that the Paniai people are constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, they are struggling with misery because of the nigel’s education and health services.
According to Gobai, the Paniai people, like other papuas, consider their vote to be a debt to Jokow, which he has to pay.
“They don’t need money, they want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting were able to cope with their last symbolic counterattack: they buried one of the victims’ bodies on the ground opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be established, they will at least not let the culprits forget their crimes.
“One of our family members was killed,” says Yacobus with his head down.
“What else could we do?”
Dubai Torch cloud-breaker swallowed by fire for the second time
A fire swept through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has devastated a high-rise building in just two years, sometimes called the Torch or Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were and no direct cause of the fire was.
“We slept and woke up to fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident who called himself George told Reuters.
Dubai civil protection officials said firefighters extinguished the flame around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it is working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident could again raise questions about the safety of materials used on high-rise outdoor surfaces around the world.
In the investigation conducted after the 2015 fire in the Torch board, it was found that the most damaged facades - exterior decorative panels and insulation - suffered.
British police have said they believe the insulation and facade panels at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June, which killed about 80 people.
These phones will probably go on sale this autumn.
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, as then phone manufacturers will reveal their new top models.
In the spring, the Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came on sale, and in the autumn, new hits are expected.
According to Tele2 Marketing and Sales Director Kristjan Seema, this year’s flagship will feature innovative design, eye-width scanner, edge-to-side 4K resolution screen and ultra-fast processor.
A great excitement was caused in the technology world by the Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the forefront of the smartphone sales chart in Estonia.
In the autumn, smart enthusiasts will be able to get even faster fast charging, a more durable battery, a higher-quality camera and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that on the basis of the rumors, it is already possible to make assumptions and predict the four top models that are likely to conquer this year’s sales charts.
These four top models of smartphones will arrive on the pools this autumn.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to arrive on the market in mid-September.
Rumors about what the new Apple model will look like and what can be done with it spread a lot.
While the iPhone 7 didn’t bring significant differences to the iPhone 6s, on Apple’s tenth birthday, the new model is expected to stand out completely from the previous ones.
There are four colors: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is apparently the screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is lost, and the fingerprint reader is built inside the screen.
Apple’s design chief JonyIve insists that the new iPhone model should look like smooth glass.
There is also a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the eye-blinking scanner, wireless charging and even higher-quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
Definitely one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Pre-orders for the new Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23.
There are many rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It is said to be designed for even more business users and the S Pen allows for even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a low-angle and the other with a narrower field of view teleobjective.
At the moment, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung’s first test, which is definitely comparable to the iPhone 8 in terms of quality.
We look forward to August 23.
While Nokia has launched three smartphones this year in the lead with the Nokia 6, there is still a shortage of their flagship, the Nokia 8, which will be unveiled on August 16.
We expect from Nokia a 5.3-inch edge-to-edge screen, a super-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
The Nokia case also talks about the aluminum body and a significant water and dust resistance grade IP68.
Similar to Samsung, the new Nokia model has two rear cameras, whose optics is produced by Zeiss.
While Sony’s firm flagship has so far been the XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We are looking forward to a smartphone that is a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but with at least the same good or better camera.
Sony’s new model has been speculated to have a screen of at least six inches.
What the reality brings, we can see soon, as Sony has traditionally unveiled its autumn flagship at the international technology exhibition IFA, which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for border wall
The Washington Post released transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
In a phone call on January 27, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The U.S. President broke the wall with him for public condemnation, saying, “You shouldn’t tell the press.”
Trump built his presidential campaign on a pledge to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts from his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull have also been released, revealing an intense discussion.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take on refugees heading to Australia was "laughable", "heroic" and "stupid". He argued that the agreement that was made during the Obama administration would leave him a "chief" impression as he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the speech by telling Turnbull it was "the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not consider the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Linines in the case in which the city of Tartu rejected their offer for the procurement of bus lines from July 2019 to 2029.
It is a decree by which the offer of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid for the Tartu bus project was rejected because the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, the head of the Tartu Municipal Government Legal Service.
It is a contract for public bus transport within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP Linna Linines appealed the decision of the Tartu district court to the Riigikohtu.
The Supreme Court did not deal with this.
While many complain on social media that the noise of the Weekend Festival is disturbing their nighttime and the whole city is full of drunk party people, there are also many who don’t have a bad word to say about the beach festival.
I was even positively surprised that the celebrations in the store were so polite!
I did not see any obscenity or obscenity.
I even saw kindness,” says the wave.
"It is nice to come, to be and to feel the joy of Pärn, which is left in the winter like a winter sleep," he joyfully adds.
The sleep on the beach is not disturbing.
When he lived in the center of the city, he still heard music being played on the beach, but now the music has not yet reached his home walls.
“But I hope I hear,” he says joyfully.
Agnes, who also spoke with Vehtuleh, says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu - it contributes greatly to the turnover of local merchants.
In addition, he is delighted that so many foreigners have come to visit the capital in the summer.
Noise does not disturb women.
I don’t have the sun on the beach anymore, but I’m glad the beach has recovered.
And it’s good that people are moving and it’s been so three times,” says the woman.
The first time was a little worse.
“Maybe there were complaints,” he thinks.
But the noise that happens on the beach, he says, is normal for summer capitals.
“This weekend is a very good promotion for our small town,” says Harri, who is staying in the park.
Noise and thunderstorms did not hit his life rhythm either.
And what?
We should keep everyone together.
To think about how this inter-national communication would be better.
A loud musician does not stumble.
It doesn’t bother me, even though I live nearby.
“Good people can save and there’s no trouble,” he says.
The guests who came here were polite.
“They’re a bit exaggerated with the bottles, of course, but the young are young and god, let go, but be human and we can do it!” he says.
The inhabitants of the coast have traveled somewhere away, either to relatives or acquaintances.
“But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life – people like this noise,” says Tiina, who walked with children in Pärnus.
His family’s dream festival music is also not disturbing, although last year it went even further than this year.
Last summer, the scene was different, so we heard more.
We live outside of the city ourselves, and it actually goes pretty well along the river Pärnu,” he says.
Pearson cuts 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to revive business
British education company Pearson said on Friday it will cut 3,000 more jobs and cut its intermediate dividends by 72 percent, launching another restructuring program to address the business's threatening congestion.
The job losses, which CEO John Fallon said are likely to be reduced by the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, will add to the 4,000 jobs lost during the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut the third cost cuts program, spending an additional £300 million ($394 million) to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House last month to its partner Bertelsmann, said its expectations for the year remained unchanged after it a 1 percent increase in sales revenue to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
On Sunday, warm weather continues with rainfall.
In Estonia, summer weather will be warm on Sunday with the possibility of rainy storms, wind outbreaks are sometimes very strong.
At night, the weather will be cleared in the clouds in Estonia.
There may be rain in some places, and it may be rainy.
It blows southwest and west winds 5-11, blows up to 14, islands and coasts up to 18 m/s.
The air temperature is 13-17 degrees.
The weather will be changing cloudy.
There is rain on many sides, there is a possibility of a rainbow.
It blows from 6 to 12, blows up to 15, on islands and on the coast up to 20 m/s.
The air temperature is 18-21 degrees.
Bombing in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
The suicide bomber, according to officials, attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
Unconfirmed local reports said three civilians were also killed in the incident in the city's Qarabaghi district.
This bombing is the latest of the violence that has hit Afghanistan this month – more than 30 people were killed in the attack on the Herat mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night’s explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with “human-carried self-made explosives.”
According to the statement, all of the wounded are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say the growing force of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) is a source of serious concern for NATO forces in Bagram in Qarabag.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul, mainly in the Shiite district.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a massive bomb attack in the city center killed more than 150 people, the most deadly military attack in the country since the U.S.-led troops ousted the Taliban in 2001.
This violence highlights the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops helping the country’s military and police.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also resulted in a public confidence crisis in the government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA cancelled the decision to postpone the wave order after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has revoked its decision to delay the Obama-era regulation that obliges states to limit emissions from dirt, one day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced its decision to continue its "2015 ozone measurement operations" late Wednesday, saying it demonstrates the agency's commitment to cooperate with the states.
“We believe we need to have a dialogue with our partners in our states and listen to them,” EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA’s intention to postpone the measurement of ozone levels in different parts of the country to determine where they should be reduced to meet stricter air quality standards by one year until October 2018.
Fifteen predominantly democratic states, together with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama. According to Trump, this is part of a broader plan to market economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked counter-reactions among Democrats and nature conservation groups, who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhaling ozone-containing air “could reduce the functioning of the lungs and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases,” such as asthma.
German pigs can come to a party.
Germany's pigs and cattle may have a feast as heavy rains threaten the harvest of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, Bloomberg writes.
This year may be the case that weeks of harvesting before harvest may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for animal food.
"The quality of the nose is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat could be used as animal feed, which is twice as much as normal, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, as well as their European counterparts, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
The winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June was replaced by a heatwave.
In July, Germany was hit by a saddle, which continued in August.
Many eyes are turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvest.
So far, only 5% of the grain has been harvested.
Most of the region has not yet started harvesting, the local harvest buyer Ceravis said.
"There are quite tough days on hand," said Frank Deckert, Ceravis' senior trader from Rendsburg.
Compatible with Finnish interior designs.
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the exhibition houses, because through the large windows the stunning views of the Saimaa shores reach many (life) rooms.
At every step, our northern neighbors strive to create both rough and perfect (energy-efficient) homes.
The Finnish use of wood as a building and finishing material, furniture and beauty products deserves admiration and respect.
Smart techniques and smart solutions can be found in exhibition houses by both the builder and the (home) designer.
It is clear that the shapes of black, white and grey shades, if supplemented by wood and plant shades, can be very humorous.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, as the fair lasts until August 13.
Accessories and herbal pots suggest that it is often cooked in this kitchen.
Last night, the line was pulled down for this year’s Weekend Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix did his best to be remembered as the last performer.
The crowd was really turning during Garrix’s performance – singing, whistling, dancing self-remindingly.
When Garrix finished, a common mass was scattered from Pärnu’s beach across the city.
We bring you a gallery with all the photos that our photographer captured over the three days of the weekend.
You’re sure to be one of them, look for yourself.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are expected to be on a collision course to face in the near future's most engaging boxing match in the weight category up to 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked the other end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization pennyweight champion.
After Garcia’s unanimous decision to defeat former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are in the top of the weight ranking.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, “How are you going, champion?
I wish you success.”
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 19 pm on ESPN.
When the couple posed for the photos, Lomachenko’s manager, Egis Klimas, noted that a possible confrontation between fighters would be “a perfect measure.”
“I’m a former plumber,” Garcia recalled.
“I moved up for Broner [to 63.5 kg], but I’m not that big.
I am 63.5 kg small.
I want to move down the lightweight.
And he has to move up to the lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans wanted that.
Let’s offer them that.”
Lomachenko agreed to.
“The boxing world needs this fight.”
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid for watching it. This is part of his strategy that he wants to let Lomachenko debut in a class of 61.2 kg by the end of this year to make it possible to meet Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 nokauti), who is also interested in fighting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their lightweight title round on the Forum on September 23.
“Watching this fight could be rewarding as fans have wanted this confrontation,” Garcia said, saying later that she is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
“We are the main players.
No other name can get so much attention.
Whenever they are ready...”
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "powerful fighter" and could go to watch his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia, saying that in his opinion the three-division champion from Riverside looked “very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted this nokauti.”
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the punch strength and then box.
Both said they felt the tension growing between them.
“It’s a struggle that awaits realization.
No other confrontation attracts so much attention and attention.
I’m more than willing to work for it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I have been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It will be a good fight.”
Which parts of the world are moved to?
Last year, the Police and Border Protection Authority (PPA) extended and issued a record number of more than 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mostly traveled to Estonia for work, study or family.
For example, if last year a temporary residence permit was decided to be issued to 6702 foreigners, this number was 4928.
Authorities do not know how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia permanently, but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
If ten years ago about 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia per year, in recent years this number is beginning to reach close to 2,000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased steadily during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, a year earlier 675.
According to the Bureau of Statistics, the number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia is growing the most – 850 more Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia than left.
“The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and due to the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that opportunities for work and study are sought in a country where the community and many also the family are already ahead,” said Kristin Rammus, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
The number of Ukrainians receiving temporary residence permits in Lulu and Tunamul was even greater than the number of Russian citizens, although in the last ten years the most temporary residence permits were issued to the latter.
If Ukrainians come here mostly for work, then Russian citizens come here for family immigration.
"Given the historic Russian community here, they are also likely to have the largest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the Internal Defense Academy.
"If you look at where the Russian citizens who received a residence permit in Estonia have moved to live, then after Harjumaa is East Virumaa," he added, noting that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1,696 Russian citizens were granted temporary residence permits, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians seeking to extend their residence permit has decreased.
"The leap is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanent settlement in Estonia," said Rammus, a spokesman for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
Foreigners who have resided in Estonia for at least three years can apply for a permanent residence permit from the previous year.
It aims to promote the presence of adapted people.
For example, a long-term residence permit is required for five years.
Due to the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit may also be reduced.
Last year, for example, a residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now Ukrainians can change jobs and the Estonian state is no longer tracking whether the salary criterion is met.
This residence permit became very popular, with grey passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36) applying.
In total, 1968 people received a residence permit to settle in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
By the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants was already 1269.
Over the past 10 years, Nigeria has surprisingly become one of the countries whose citizens are among the most active applicants for a residence permit in Estonia.
When three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, 200 were issued last year.
They come from Nigeria to study at universities here.
Furthermore, Estonian universities are popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely due to educational migration.
Also in their case, the rule applies that where a community has emerged, it is easier for others to join," Rammus added.
In the last ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from, for example, North Korea, the same number from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people came from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If approximately 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit annually, this is approximately 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if we count the citizens of the European Union, migration remains around a percentage," Maasing said, adding that the numbers are actually small.
A total of 14,822 people migrated to Estonia last year, and 13,792 came out of Estonia.
This means that immigration surpassed the second year of emigration.
Most of the expatriates and immigrants are Estonian citizens, but more are among those who leave.
Therefore, the migrant balance of Estonian citizens last year was at least 2000 people.
Estonians migrate mainly from Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's Princess Fashion Enchants with Sats, Ticants and Tolls
For Maria Tammeoru, however, the unfounded arsenal of ideas is history – old paintings and costumes: “I can dream for hours somewhere in a museum and admire old-fashioned gloves and cracks.
If you do something with passion, you study and learn more about it every day.
It is the joy of discovery.
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem strange to some, but the designer doesn’t think so.
You decide how much light you have in your life.
I have a friend who has a whole sauna filled with haute couture dresses I created.
Because it’s not her fault that she doesn’t live in Hollywood and don’t walk on the red carpet every day, she also wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and wear it!
You can make your life special.
A fashion designer does not recognize the gap between bright events and a gray everyday life.
It was this thought that triggered the plan to bring high fashion in Estonia to the countryside, between forests and fields, to people to whom fashion often does not reach.
The Mammu collection was presented, for example, at the Võrus, Jõhvis and Pärnu Fashion Hall, where the royal show with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, people are often taken in the pose, grabbed with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - they shout bravo, get up, want to thank you with the hand.
A large part of the audience just came to innovate, but now they are fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people’s expectations, they’ll be thrilled!
And I like the feeling that I’m on a summer trip with my fashion.
In Pärnu we had a 50 meters long red carpet, the whole street full of beautiful dresses, it seemed that they would never end!
Maria also does not acknowledge the fashion tradition that creations must be presented to a supermodel, she is happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they are always happy to come.
It’s such a wonderful experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I’m so sorry I’ve never seen my show myself, I’m always behind the stage to give things the last slice as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve would not allow me to calmly look out of the room.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who doesn’t just want to play a representative role, but to be in the hands of everything.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection I do myself.
I like the whole process in which you play with the details, discover.
I’m never far from my creativity and I’m not afraid of work.
The matter is not limited to design, as well as stylistics, logistics, organization, organization - everything has to fit the day of one temperamental woman.
These hours of work are huge for fanatics.
I can’t say when my day will end, it’s just a day of joy for me!
I’m still very lucky – it’s like an endless chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and again compliments.
How many times has it been said that there is magic in my dresses - they make you feel like a princess.
The glamorous squirts that made Maria Talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin Müürsepp of the U18 boys: the weapon of the Estonian undergroup tournament was now turned against us
Sadly, the story is over.
The first thing I noticed was that we didn’t get to our table.
And if there is such a big difference on the table, there is nothing to do," commented on the 61:75 defeat of the Estonian U18 basketball boys to Britain our only basketball player who played in the NBA, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin Müürsepp.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attack table and received so many more attacks as a result.
We were also not ready for their aggressive defense or attack, it created.
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up the defense.
In defense, however, they managed to hold hands everywhere, we could not combine.
It hit the team under the legs.
The homework was done better.
According to Mursepa, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to reduce the opponent’s momentum.
In the last quarter, we had zero mistakes, but the opponents already got several quick baskets.
Athletics and tightness, which was our weapon in the sub-group tournament, turned all against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
Mursepp remained at peace with his caregiver in Kalevi, Matthias Tass.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team, so far there was a single strike force.
It is a pity that such an aggressive opponent has not been met before.
The cup has been confident all the time and still played out today, but it seemed like she was tired - she has carried a pretty heavy burden.
But he did some pretty moves that I’ve seen in training before,” adds the instructor.
Terrible numbers: the women’s basketball team scored less than 10 points in three quarters of the EM tournament...
In the U18 age class, not only the young men's B-division basketball tournament in Tallinn, the girls started yesterday in Dublin.
Unfortunately, the match with Poland was an anti-record.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter it was 9:49 or only in the last ten minutes the opponents took the foot from the gas pedal and that period remained 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4 points, the third one.
At the same time, the Estonians first hit two of the first four shots in two minutes, then 25 shots in the game, then one in three and then 21 shots in the game.
In about half an hour, 47 shots were shot.
There were two points out of four free points.
There was a reasonable number of losses at that time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland scored 33 percent and Estonia 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia started with two losses, the opening day had to admit the advantage of Portugal 83:56.
NATO ships arrived in Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO’s 1st Permanent Anti-Mine Group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit for the weekend to replenish ship supplies and prepare for upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships will prepare for their return to the sea, while giving the crew a few days of rest.
After the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to conduct a series of exercises and be prepared for future operations in search of historic explosives.
“The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and their co-operation training in local waters well demonstrates our integration with the Allied forces,” said Arto Reinmaa, commander-in-chief of the Navy’s Operations and Planning Division.
Since June 29, NATO's 1st permanent anti-mining group has been headed by Latvian Navy Lieutenant Captain Gvido Laudups, who took over the duties of group leader at a ceremony held in Riga from Estonian Navy Officer Lieutenant Captain Johan-Elias from Seljama.
The Group’s flagship is the Latvian Navy’s support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, on which the Group’s headquarters also operates.
This semester, the international unit will also include Estonian Navy mining commander Sakala.
One of the four groups of ships under NATO’s maritime command, NATO’s 1st Permanent Anti-Mine Group is one of the first fast-reacting readiness units that the alliance can send to different parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become the place where the 13 years ago Birgitta Festival, organized by Maestro Eri Klasi, will be held.
This year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to the artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic Risto Joosti (36).
Risto Joost: The audiences will receive “Traviata” and “Tosca” from the classics of the opera world, ballet responses from the enchanting “Boleros” to the fun “Karlsson”, as well as a self-production, this time by Joseph Haydn’s wonderful oratory “Years” by the same international creative team that brought another Haydn’s masterpiece “Creation” to the Pirita stage in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It’s bigger than any music theatre in its usual form.
It’s a festival whose charm takes power and never gets rid of it again.
For the experience that the listener receives in this lofty and mysterious environment makes human souls sound and touches human traits in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic director of Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the shoes of the Maestro Different Class look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with the Special Class, this has been a lot of help.
He guided me throughout my student career and also supported me at the beginning of my conductive career.
Per that is what makes it easier for me to continue my work.
Eri Klas has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it all passes on to me.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things are going.
It was Eri Klasi’s great heart that also gave me the strength to move forward with the Tallinn Philharmonic Birgitta Festival.
And here I am now and I can do it!
What would be exciting for the audience at this year’s festival, what special do you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, the first ballet, written for the story of Astrid Lindgren, will be presented.
“Karlsson is flying.”
And one curious nuance is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed the desire to write this work.
Apparently, he has had a Karlsson character in his soul since childhood.
Rose, how do you get it all?
Thanks to my supportive partner.
Such work requires a support system and a lot of love, and I am fortunate to have a lot of that.
And I’ve noticed that my personal emotions don’t depend so much on other people as on myself, or how I deal with each new day.
And so consciously keeping the tone, keeping the positivity, and actually smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning, significantly increased my happiness percentage.
Especially now this week, when there are the most important tests, I have practiced it especially eagerly and it works.
Smiling to yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It is not just a word.
I think people don’t know half of the things the universe offers them about their bodies, but everyone will gradually discover it.
Right now is an important moment.
Do you have any rituals before entering the board?
We need to change clothes for more comfortable ones.
This is a small moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don’t have the opportunity to rest or get a little sleep before a big performance.
In fact, I even like to actively communicate with people, even before entering the conductor’s board.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, here is something to discover even for a not great friend of opera and ballet!
Watch the exciting video with Risto Joost!
New results of the age assessment tests for asylum seekers in Sweden
In Sweden, asylum-seekers were tested to evaluate their age with a new medical approach. The latest results show that more than 80 percent of the test subjects were assessed to be older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were created to more accurately assess age during asylum applications after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to correctly determine the age of several alleged minor refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has submitted 6,880 cases for testing, and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2,481 test results from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed to be 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the Forensic Institute assessed that the test subject "may be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person was "presumably younger than 18".
The test is used only if the age of the person is questionable.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
"We don't see a big difference compared to the statistics of the previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute released the results of 581 tests in May and said that in 442 cases "there are indications that the person being studied is 18 years old or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet looked at the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases the person had directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This medical method of age assessment, in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints are taken to be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some areas.
One of the skeptics is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose tasks include evaluating the biological maturity of people to find out whether they passed through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I have had reason to think about this and I don't think the measurement method currently used should be used.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say for sure, then we shouldn’t make the face that we can,” he told the newspaper Metro.
But Johan Göransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of a child becoming an incorrect adult is low.
The highest risk, approximately 10 percent, is if a person is a little under 18.”

20-year-old copper skater Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the London World Cup, taking a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was the youngest female left-hander in the World Cup, and the joyful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I had a good experience.
In the first attempt (64.80) I immediately scored my average score, in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," Orel said after the race.
I was looking for my discharge and I am very happy that I found it.
Anna Maria Orel’s World Cup debut ended with a good 18th place.
The rains didn’t bother Orel because he trains through the winter at the TTU stadium.
“I’m hardened,” he said with a little muzzle.
The London Olympic Stadium was almost full of people, did Orel perceive the people around him or was he able to turn off himself?
I know, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it gives more – so it is!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will be peaceful with the World Cup debut and many more good competitions awaiting him: "I came here this season with the 32nd, the last result, I finished 18th.
This is a very decent result.
I’m 20 years old and MM – that’s the only thing that matters.
I have a good experience and I want to compete for medals in a few days.
West Virginia Governor Announces Party Change
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced at a meeting with President Trump on Thursday evening that he would change parties.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," Justice said.
“Today I tell you, having prayed a lot and thought ... today I tell you, West Virginiaans, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor.”
There were joyful rallies at the meeting.
“So I’ll be a Republican tomorrow,” Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to play another game."
Trump had previously promised a major announcement at a West Virginia gathering.
Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the state's only billionaire according to Forbes, turned out to be elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and he inherited the coal business from his father.
Its value is approximately $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement on Thursday evening that "the change of Governor Justice's party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather prevent the country from improving again than work for it."
“Of the 15 governorships and the lowest number of states in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is just the most recent dismissal to a party that is endless and unable to find a positive and unifying message,” RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Not surprisingly, there are many people injured.
Urmet, who was in the office of the medical club on the weekend, told the Evening News that the patches had to be distributed quite a lot.
Blisters and scratches are basic, out twists and slight falls.
There are also headaches, back and legs.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival in the wrong shoes and so the problems come.
Doctors have also had to help a couple of visitors with more serious injuries - there have been some panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
We have also done seams when a person has a broken arm or finger.
The smaller seams are done here, the larger ones are sent to the hospital.
See in the video if the festive doctors also ask for a painkiller for the treatment of poemly.
Coe apologizes to Russians for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe praised Russia’s “honest apology” for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it’s not the time to allow the sport back to Russia.
Russian athlete Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championship that the competition ban imposed on his country is correct and he has a firm goal of fighting doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who have lost gold and silver medals in the competition.”
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the competition ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I think it was a very honest response today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole council and the whole congress were pleased that the Russian Confederation itself acknowledged that they have had quite difficult times and that they will do everything possible to restructure the Confederation."
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its reconstruction.
“I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the Working Group’s proposal that it’s not the right time to take Russia back,” Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always been based on the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the broken system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict IAAF criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championship, which begins in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF working group, said on Monday that Russia still does not meet several criteria for reconstruction.
After a report to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping controls were still inadequate and that banned coaches still acted freely.
The revolution of electric cars will dramatically change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only will the electric car revolution dramatically change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say they win from one place and lose from another, smaller mining companies don’t help.
Glencore currently serves on coal and oil, but in the future, in the era of electric cars, demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel will grow.
This year’s increase in electric cars has been driven by decisions by the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway, which pledged to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
Volvo has already announced that it plans to abandon internal combustion engines and Tesla will bring a cheaper Model 3 electric car to the market.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, in the next two decades, more electric cars will be sold than oil-fueled cars.
"In terms of some metals, this changes everything," Capital Economics raw material analyst Simona Gambranini told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great impact on such metals as cobalt and lithium, the demand for which has grown over the years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than conventional cars, Glencore.
Even more copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates it will increase copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
Increasing demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will benefit from the growing electric car trend from rising copper prices and being the world’s largest cobalt producer, Jefferies Group predicted.
The other winners in the electric car competition are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, the London Stock Exchange has risen by 70 percent.
The price increase was 37 percent.
The price of copper has also risen by 14 percent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore shares rose by 20 percent in London, surpassing rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo Americana in price increases.
On the loser side are lead companies like Recyclex and Campine, who have to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of lead is batteries that power the starters of petrol and diesel-powered cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to the demand for gasoline unless there is any other purpose for it that could overcome the decline in demand," said Michael Widmer, head of metal market analysis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
In the face of the price movement of lead, the effect of a looming trend is not yet noticeable.
Lead has risen 17 percent this year, making it one of London’s top industrial metals in price increases.
Investors will see problems with metals only in the distant future.
“I’m not sure it’s so bad for lead because cheap oil keeps conventional cars competing,” said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at Triland Metals.
When lead demand drops, it happens slowly.
This may happen in about ten years.
So far, however, harsher emission standards mean a growing demand for hybrid cars, which rely on advanced lead-based batteries for frequent engines, the international lead and zinc research organization estimates.
Light metals such as aluminum replace steel because a lighter car can drive further with less electricity.
This explains an additional 1.6 million tons of aluminum minimum demand by 2013-2016.
It accounts for 2.7 percent of the world’s total aluminum production.
This trend is likely to deepen, Widmer said.
Aluminium has risen 13 percent this year, as growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steelers are not sleeping.
AK Steel Holding is partnering with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce miraculously lightweight car boilers.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also working to develop a lighter alloy of steel to withstand the aluminum minimum.
“Super-strength steel should be the answer to this development,” said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil era can also bring suffering to the platinum.
In the past, about half of that precious metal was used to catalyze diesel-powered cars, said metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
“Many of the raw materials that are currently in high demand, such as oil and platinum, may not be in high demand in the future,” said Bernard Dahdah, a raw material analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe there is a continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore chief executive Marc Grynberg said that by 2025, more hybrid cars will continue to be sold than fully electric cars.
The big hope for platinum manufacturers over the next 10 years is for hydrogen-based cars developed by Toyota Motors and Hyundai Motos, which rely on platinum to produce electricity from hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has not commercially justified itself.
“Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars,” said Exane Brunet of BNP Paribas.
German automakers suffered a major downturn in July after a Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche’s hometown.
How Football Financial Rules Affect Neymar's Transfer to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing uncontrolled spending by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving from the Spanish football club Barcelona to the French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that governs the European game and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, are still waiting for Paris Saint-Germain.
UEFA’s Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP) introduced in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar’s transition was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar’s salary is set to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s transfer to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to raise such money to recruit Neymar and add it to its star-rich ranks, given that the team is funded by a family ruled by Qatar’s energy breaker.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on recruiting players, but they must balance this with legal sources of income that will allow them to get out with their own in the football industry.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into high debt in their quest for success were actually engaged in fraud and risked collapse if banks or owners were to give up support.
Since 2011, the FFP has focused on tracking their losses instead of club debts.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 at Chelsea - to buy a club with potential and then make large spending to improve the team and build a global brand - will be more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year assessment period of the FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs may be liable for losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini’s shameful removal from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, is still committed to preventing excess spending.
"FFP is not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," Andrea Traverso, an FFP supervisor at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar for the acquisition clause as a single full payment, they are able to divide that amount for accounting purposes into portions for the duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so it is possible to show a transition fee of €44.4 million annually over the next five years.
For the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, suffered the toughest penalties.
PSG was fined €60 million (at the time $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million, and the club was required to restrict the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that may try to scam over regulatory financial institutions by blowing their income up through companies affiliated with club owners.
The Qatar company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income.
This happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the subsidy to PSG was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been said that a portion of Neymar's PSG service could come through payments from Qatar to the World Cup Organizing Committee in 2022.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become a World Cup ambassador, and argue that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a manoeuvre.
The sanctions previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant about any attempts to disregard the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not proactively discussed Neymar's transfer with PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that their anonymity is guaranteed as they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest reports show that PSG earned more than €10 million in profits in the 2015-2016 season with a turnover of approximately €542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year has not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar’s arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions, merchandising and shirt sales.
The club expects a turnover increase of at least 30 percent in connection with the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to block Neymar’s transition by arguing that PSG violated the FFP by doing so.
"This is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the country," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG is mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports giant, shares the La Liga’s stance that the state is funding the club.
"This is a consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of the fair game, as the state may have other ways or other interests to represent the country by such a big player.”
Norwegian has a nice tradition of putting pictures of people who have pushed boundaries in their field and inspired others on a plane.
Along with the expansion of Norwegian’s geography of operations, the circle of people who deserve a place on the airplane has also expanded.
Among the selected figures are Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (pictured) and Miguel de Cervantes.
Soon, one of the planes will be decorated with the portrait of Queen's legendary singer Freddie Mercury.
Today, 50 years ago, a hurricane-sized storm in Estonia broke the roofs and windows of houses.
The hurricane, called the Storm of the Century, which struck the 6th and 7th of August, caused great damage, especially in the Baltic, Harjuma and Raplama.
In the northwest of Estonia, the wind speed was over 30 m/s during those days.
My old man ran from one curved tree to another in the garden and tried to support them with his hands.
It was dark and rough, like the end of the world.
The roofs of the houses were already flying, Linda Kurova Haapsalus recalled in 2002 in an interview with Estonian Nature.
Linda’s wife saw her own garden collapse.
But what do you support the trees with your hands, where do you get against such a storm?
The sea came under the window, the water sprinkled through the windows,” said Mrs. Linda, who lived on Haapsalus Kalda Street at the time.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station's perron had flown 20-30 meters away, Linda saw most of the haaps only the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were in the wild, some completely lying down, some half.
Everything looked very depressing, a storm passed through the beautiful old trees as a rainbow and a threshold like a war.
Western Virumaa was not badly affected by the August storm in 1967 compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was still large there, Virumaa Teataja wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were wiped out of the land, but the parks of our village were also severely affected.
In Tallinn, the speed of the wind was measured up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
On the evening of August 6th, in Tallinn on the Sea Field, a small bulldozer cried out: “Mom, mom!
Chickens are in the air and can’t go down!” wrote Virumaa Teataja.
The building in Viljandland was so damaged during the storm that it was later decided to be demolished.
The Augustus storm was not resisted by the structures of the Tyr ski jumping mountain, which were later not restored.
The newspaper Red Star on August 12, 1967 that the cleaning of cities and settlements from fallen trees and their branches was progressing slowly, and that residents could take part in the cleaning work.
The crop fields were also severely affected by the storm, and the newspaper that “party organizations must be an incentive and a guide in both repair and harvesting.”
Hurricanes can be referred to when the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record for strong wind in Estonia is from November 2, 1969, when the wind speed was measured at 48 m/s in Ruhnu.
On Vaindloo Island, a meter broke, so the speed of the strong wind that was measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean beaches: nighttime cleaning and poor beaches
The cooler summer weather also means less cleaning trouble on Tallinn’s bathing beaches.
“When there’s weather, there’s people on the beach, and if there’s no people, there’s no people,” says the beach cleaner.
On the beach in northern Tallinn Stroom crawl kajakes.
They are offered melodic competition at low turns by a swirling tractor that runs down the stripes to the beach.
In fact, the last seals through the sand from a depth of seven centimeters, collecting marine garbage and human waste: bottlenecks, cigarettes, and more.
People still come to the beach, regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If the weather is good, people will be on the beach, and if not, there will be no people,” says Alexander Usov, head of beach cleaning at Haabersti Administration.
It is 6:30 and there is a bitter cleaning work on the beach, because at 8 o'clock the square must be clean for people.
Usov is at work at four o’clock.
In addition to Stroom, he keeps an eye on Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakari beach.
The waste has decreased.
Years ago it was much more.
People are already able to appreciate what is being done for them,” says Usov, who has been harvesting the beaches for 15 years.
Once something was put up, it was broken the next day.
Now what is on the beach.
The price of the beach
One of the biggest works on Estonian beaches is the harvesting of marine garbage, or adru, which is laid on the coast.
For example, on the Pirita beach, 400,000 tons will have to be transported during the beach season.
“It’s an incredible amount,” Usov notes.
The second big category is household garbage, or everything that people leave behind.
The half-kilometer Stroom Beach Line has eight large garbage containers that need to be drained three times a week.
So much rubbish.
However, the colder summer worlds have meant that there is a fifth less garbage than otherwise.
The third type is the abandoned things.
They are mostly children.
Within the sand of Usov, a dozen models of cars have been scattered.
They are left to wait for the owners on the frame that leads to the beach.
"There are usually more of them out, but this is a normal catch." Usov already knows that soon he will find them inside the sand again.
Children come to the beach and take their toys to drown them again in the sand.
The rubbish is scattered
Erika Scholler, a representative of Haabersti’s administrative services, admits that locals are disturbing the screening of the tractor.
The noise, which lasts from night to early morning, disturbs the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
During the day, this is impossible.
In one month, the rand must be screened twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," Scholler notes.
But the goal is, like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärn, to get the Stroom beach under the international blue flag quality label.
"Compared to Europe, Estonia has much more work to do to ensure that the beaches areined," says Scholler.
We have more rocks and stones, and the sand is harder to screw.
However, there is less garbage on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Hearing the talk of garbage on the beach, Martin, who lives near the beach of Stroom, unforcedly enters the conversation circle of journalists and cleaning workers, highlighting the current gaps on the beach.
In the morning, there are pictures everywhere.
The problem is with birds and bottle-gatherers who have drawn their garbage bags,” Martin says.
While it’s hard to expect people to be able to change their previous behaviors, Martin hopes that the city will do something with garbage boxes and put covers on them, for example, to prevent at least the birds from going there.
Overall, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of Stroom Beach.
The city is taking care of it.
With children's fields, illuminated and freshly paved roads, it has become more pleasant.
Once upon a time, rollers could only drive in one direction,” Martin says.
Treasure hunting finds in Stroom: coins, only coins
Dimitri, a 40-year-old man, has taken advantage of the early morning period, chesting the beach with a metal detector as a treasure hunter.
He does not believe that he will find anything valuable today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough.
"I have been dealing with it for a year and have not found anything valuable so far," says Dmitri.
As a hobby hunter, Dmitry’s treasure bag has some euro coins, bottle baskets, and also dangerous nails, which he later throws into the trash.
Usually there are coins.
“Golden, rings, and anything like that are usually not there,” said the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at previous levels as weak economic growth and easing inflation have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain slow as households’ steep incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers voted in favour of keeping the 6:2 rate at 0.25% and fewer members are calling for a rise this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on household incomes would continue, as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in autumn.
However, the bank also pointed out that the rate hikes will be necessary to curb Brexit-related inflation over the next few years and that financial markets may need higher than expected lending costs.
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package for the economy launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
The bank will end a fixed-term funding scheme in February, offering banks cheap funding, despite saying it is now expected to raise the offer by £15 billion, or £115 billion, under the scheme.
In the protocols of the decision on the rate, the bank says: “In the average MPC forecast, the gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future, as the difficult real income situation of households will continue to affect consumption.”
On rates, it was repeated that “some tightening of monetary policy” would be necessary to mitigate inflation, and “somewhat more” than the markets expect.
The stock market is currently forecasting a first rise in the third quarter of next year and a second rise in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any kind of jump is gradual and limited.
The bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7% respectively.
The forecast for a 1.8% growth for 2018 remained.
Following this news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators that have suppressed growing hopes for growth, with GDP rising from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to gain some momentum by the end of the year.
The bank’s latest inflation report gave little reason to delight households suffering from rising inflation and miserable wage increases, saying that the situation will get a little worse before it improves.
It added that monetary policy cannot prevent a blow to income in the next few years, but a noticeable rebound in wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Because of the weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by the growing demand for British production, which partially compensates for lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were raised by 0.25% last August after a shocking EU referendum that caused the pound to suddenly weaken.
The bank estimates it will probably take four years to fully revive prices and the economy.
Before the bank’s last decision, there was a growing demand for a rate hike as inflation had increased the pressure on impoverished households; in July, three policymakers called for the rate to rise to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected and is expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the excessive growth compared to the 2 percent target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco’s mortgage brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming more and more competitive again, as lenders are eager to work and hope to end the year positively.
The exchange appears to be favourable for those whose existing transactions are beginning to complete, as refinancing, often free of charge and at low rates, has become increasingly popular.”
The NHS is writing out HIV medication for 10,000 people
Patients have had access to "transformative" HIV-preventive treatment since September, following a suppressed battle in the Supreme Court over whether or not the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England that the National Health Service is now making pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) available to an estimated 10,000 people during the initial three-year clinical trial, a tablet administered before intercourse that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal endorsed the Supreme Court’s decision last year that the NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite the agency’s own claims that the drug should be funded rather by local authorities.
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens welcomed the move announced on Thursday as a “new large-scale intervention,” while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as a “turning point.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people. More clinics will be added in October before the program is rooted everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medications taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there is a sufficient amount of certain medicines in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or no later than two hours before intercourse.
Suitable candidates for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not treated.
Clinics will identify suitable people who will agree to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose partner with HIV does not receive antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register with the local Sexual Health Clinic that participates in the program.
The program costs £10 million and NHS England signed an agreement to receive the medicines this week after an international tender.
The clinical trial aims to assess the actual potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence about who the drug is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in the big picture.
Stevens said: “This new comprehensive intervention should complement and enhance the widespread and increasingly successful fight against HIV spread.
This is another milestone in the more than three decades-long struggle against one of humanity’s biggest health problems.”
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted correctly to those who need it and are at risk, offers the opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV in England will have access to a powerful new tool through this NHS-funded clinical trial that is managed individually and not dependent on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “It is now a priority to ensure that the clinical trial across the country is promptly postponed and that no person at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP’s clinical trial drug has been acquired, we’re on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of getting infected with HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Public Health Minister, said: “The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcomed and heavily delayed after months of delays and the government’s pulling legs.
Evidence shows how much change this drug can bring in the work of preventing HIV and stopping the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial brings us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is deployed across the country as soon as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society.”
The price of electricity in Estonia increased by 12%, while in Latvia and Lithuania it declined.
In July, the difference in the stock price of electricity the next day between Estonia and the price regions of Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering said.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish union.
In Estonia, the average stock price of electricity was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour last month and the price rose 12 percent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price dropped by five percent from €36.27 per megawatt hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros and the Nord Pool system price was 26.37 euros per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12% and 7% respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, 75 percent of the hours of last month went to Estonia and 16 percent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
For the remaining nine percent of the hours, no transactions took place the next day between the two countries.
Electricity between Estonia and Latvia was transported from Estonia to Latvia for 99 percent of the time and the total transmission capacity was used for 73 percent of the hours.
According to transactions on the last trading day in July, the Nasdaq OMX market could be around 34 euros per megawatt-hour in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects the production price of electricity, rose last month and the transactions took place at the price of EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
Living in Exaltation - A Half Floor and Smart Design Tips Have Made This Small Earls Court Apartment A Spatial Home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate renovator, exchanged her big Knightsbridge home in 2014 for an Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and resold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my former partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day."
From the first visit, this 93-square-meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation course.
At first, it was an apartment with a single bedroom and a complex layout - to get to the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
These were my demands,” he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from the Duck & Shed architectural and design studio at Notting Hill to take advantage of the 3.8-meter-high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The roof was not high enough to include two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half-story where one could stand.
Erfan had to approach the matter creatively.
“The metal construction is quite complicated,” he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they were placed on top of each other without having to bow down.
It wasn’t just about building a platform, but we used a steel structure to ensure the right height of both the upper and lower rooms.”
This setting allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms apart in the room with plenty of dramatic elements.
From the half-floor opens up to the glamorous living room overlooking the retrovius window with ancient copper light.
Gold furniture with a mirror surface, silver details and the retro-angled Serge Mouille lighting emphasize the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, spatiality, and light density.
There are mirrors attached to both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with a mirror leaves the impression of a window opening into another room.
At the entrance, a mirror cabinet provides storage for all of Joanne’s dishes and glass dishes.
The charm of the living room is added by the possibility of closing the kitchen part when not in use, creating the imagination of a more glamorous room.
Combined kitchens are nothing new.
However, with this kitchen, the unique fact is that it is a lifting door of the type of a garage.
“That took a little design trouble,” Erfan explains in an MDF door spooned with steel reinforcement.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it slips very easily when pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 additional square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved apartment plan.
“Ultimately, the floor is what you sell – or what gives value to the property,” says Erfan.
"A real estate agent enters the room in an outdated form and makes calculations based on the floor area."
Here, they have been able to increase the floor surface, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"Materials are what you touch and thus help create an emotional bond with the home," says Erfan.
“You don’t fall in love with the electric cable on the wall.
It’s important, but it doesn’t make the tongue sound.”
This shows that a good design and an enlarged area will help make a pretty ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may even give rise to the desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
Dane Jensen is a Chicago skyscraper who competes with a colleague for promotion.
Nothing matters except the amount of money earned, alongside which all ethics is forgotten.
He only sees his wife and three children early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I get to think that it’s a version of the business world of “Card House” – even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler’s speech is similar.
The more the film goes on, the less the framework element remains, and the moralizing intention of filmmakers is becoming more and more evident.
A life-changing experience for the protagonist becomes the son’s illness with cancer.
You have to choose between work and family life.
A son who dreams of becoming an architect makes his father walk to the big buildings of Chicago to think about things that really matter, such as faith, kindness, love... not even the Twin Towers disaster.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father’s eyes, there is a feeling that the filmmakers have set out to make the audience cry, because even the most bright-hearted viewer can’t hold back the tears of seeing the suffering of the beloved cancer boy.
When the son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally realizes the morality of his work and does a good deed to an old man looking for work.
Now I bet on myself – if the movie has a happy ending, I’ll reward my insight after the movie with a coffee, but if I’m wrong, the screenwriter can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, the suspicion arises that she is without coffee – when her husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man storms down the corridor toward the palace.
However, the son is miraculously healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, this also turns out to be positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can also feel good - I can already predict the end of American drama quite well!
In honor of the truth, the film is well-constructed, all the necessary elements are available.
You can cry, you can laugh, actors are good and morals are beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I think this movie gets in well.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to limit the president’s media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
John F. Kelly can do that.
In that case he would be the first.
Politico writes that the new White House staff chief plans to limit the flow of information, including news, to President Trump, in the hope that it will keep the boss in the flat water.
Here’s the broken reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met with senior officials on his first day in office, he highlighted a key problem with President Donald Trump at the White House that he planned to solve – getting bad information into the hands of the president.
Kelly told officials that information had to flow through him, whether on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if good information was shared with him."
Kelly’s diagnosis seems quite logical, but others have tried it too and have failed to hide Trump by tracking his media consumption.
President Trump’s relationship with television dates back decades, and even now that he is in the White House, his TV-watching habits have not gone anywhere.
“When the candidate Trump was angry at his dishonest media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also honestly covered in the affected media,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politic in February.
Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that, “According to six former campaign workers, the key to controlling Trump’s Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption is steadily included in the praise song.”
well is .
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habits have ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Per these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don’t know—that Trump’s tweets would have been even more flaming without their intervention.
We’ll probably never find out about tweets that Trump didn’t post.
If his assistants were able to save him from trouble a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from constantly provoking controversy.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that people in the competing cliques of the White House are exclusively trying to promote their own interests by delivering to Trump material that supports their worldview, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, reflecting the whole story, wrote in May about the tendency of advisors to feed the president with strategically questionable information.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
“Current and former Trump subjects say that Trump may react to negative press, especially to infographics with a detrimental effect, explosively by becoming obsessed with identifying their source.
That was the case in late February, when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article on GotNews.com, a website owned by Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief Staff Officer Katie Walsh of being the White House "source of multiple information".
It doesn’t matter whether Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of the insult, or that he has not provided any concrete evidence, or that he has also made false accusations and withdrawn them in the past.
Trump read the article and began to inherit Walsh from his subjects.”
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House chief of office Rob Porter "have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents coming to Trump."
How did it succeed?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Street musicians coming from abroad do not get permission to perform bitter.
There are a lot of foreigners in the centre of Tallinn.
Those with whom the evening page was talked to admitted that they were playing in the old town without the permission of the city council.
As the first, we found three street musicians near the Viru gates who had taken the same number of dogs with them.
It was clearly seen that musicians with roast patches and broken clothes were backpackers who would take a shower to get rid of the berry.
Despite her appearance, the only woman in the company played the story with a fun rhythm on the chord, while a man next to her jongled with three balls and called the passers closer.
The third man was sitting next to them on one of their backpacks and smoking a self-made twisted blade in a heartbeat.
These three dogs did not allow themselves to disturb the passing people.
Noemi, who played the accordion, and Bob, who jeongled with balls, said they were mocking on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the company’s performance was to collect ticket money for a ship to Finland on the same evening.
Asked if they were asking the city for permission to mosquito in the old town, Noemi and Bob shaken their heads.
First, we did not know.
Second, we never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple, and most of the time we get permissions for a month or so.
It makes no sense to pay for it,” Bob explained.
When we reached the gate of Viru again about 20 minutes later, we saw two women standing with the musicians and pushing them away.
The company moved to the crossroads of Viru Center with backpacks and dogs to try their luck.
Three young Polish men also performed on Viru Street, one of whom played violin, the other clarinet and the third had taken an electronic piano.
"We are here to provide entertainment to people, to spread music and joy, and to make money for fuel and living," explained trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that there must be permission from the municipality to perform.
“Of course we don’t have that,” he said in a joke.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, then there is no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we will go elsewhere, but we have to try,” he added.
Estonian central bank purchased bonds for €149 million in July as part of the public sector asset purchase programme of the euro area central banks, the central bank’s bond portfolio increased to €4.36 billion.
The central bank does not publish more detailed information about the purchases.
Hardo Hansson, President of the Estonian Bank, has previously explained that the Eurosystem’s central bank asset purchase plan covers three different programmes: covered bonds (financial sector), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Under the influence of purchases, the yield of lower-risk assets decreases and this motivates investors to take greater risks.
As a rule, each central bank purchases government bonds in its own country under the Public Sector Bond Purchase Programme, but no other country bonds are purchased.
Since the Estonian government has not issued bonds, the Estonian Bank will make so-called replacement purchases within the amount allocated to them.
Replacement purchases are also carried out by central banks in countries where the offering of bonds in accordance with the purchase plan is limited.
The Estonian Bank, according to Hansson, generally buys bonds of European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
The Estonian Bank will purchase bonds as part of its asset purchase program from March 2015.
Meanwhile, Elering bonds were also acquired, but since June 2016, the Estonian Bank no longer purchases Elering bonds.
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area, the Finnish central bank will purchase both Elering and Estonian Energy bonds from June.
Travellers ignore the grafts and return to the "millionaire district"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in West Midlands have once again gotten into a furious confrontation with determined migrants who have ignored the cave excavated by the council to regain a field away from their villas.
Travellers have parked their 20 trailer villas in the field near Solihull Street, a wealthy "millionaire district".
They have returned with an army of horses, children, and trucks after only being kicked out there in May, without being disturbed by the crawl that the council dug to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the defensive boundaries by squeezing their vehicles through an unhindered portion that had been left as a pedestrian path.
Thirsty residents have cursed the Solihull council, saying that the council is “inutile in dealing with the problem.”
One anonymous resident said, “They moved there on Monday night after they were kicked out of Bentley Heath, where they stoned passers with stones.
The council must be ashamed to take action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away and now they are back again.
They came last night, probably even more today.”
He added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barricades to protect its parks.
I live on the streetsbrook road, and I’m not happy to have to continue paying the council fee if the council can’t even stop that.”
One local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said: “This is ridiculous. We just saw how the last of these travellers left, and a new invasion is already taking place.
This time, the number has grown and the grassland has even been seen remembering the horse."
A Solihull council spokesman said: “We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite in the land near the Streetsbrook Road, and we are cooperating with Solihull police. We are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
It is very helpful to collect evidence if as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the court if we present the case to them."
The weekend festival will be visited among others by Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is pleased that real world top names have been brought to Estonia.
Asked why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians, Saar replies that this should be asked by all those who enjoy the three days of the festival with full breasts.
However, he believes that there are real people in the area.
"When you look at the level of artists that have been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute top names of this musical genre are brought home - this is often not the case in our country," says the minister of culture.
Which artists perform on the festival, but the island itself speaks the most?
I consider myself to be a relatively old man, and for old people like me, one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who stood up last night.
According to his recording, we’ve all turned our feet at some point,” he says.
There are several other titles, including Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, also our own Estonian makers: starting with NOËP and you can read a whole series of them.
In reality, the concentration of these well-known names is very high,” he says.

Audi Upgrades Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles
A day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the chairman of BMW, the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including BMW's hometown Munich, which have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
No company described these operations as a recall.
European automakers have eagerly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with carbon emissions regulations.
However, the nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
Furthermore, the cost of equipment installed to neutralize the emissions of diesel vehicles in the air for automotive companies will increase, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German automakers are under thorough investigation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government is also accused of lamenting powerful automakers and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which silenced the use of so-called fraud devices, which allowed to adjust the emissions indicator to the regulations during the car's testing, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics subdivision of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian citizen and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be prosecuted in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany after authorities accused Audit of installing a system to circumvent European emissions requirements, thus expanding the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could be a big deal for Volkswagen – the luxury car maker generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
Estonian schools will receive European Union flags for 20,000 euros.
The Ministry of Education plans to purchase the flag of the European Union for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency of the European Union.
In total, 570 educational institutions with dimensions of 105x158 centimeters will receive the European Union flag.
The flags are intended for exhibition in indoor rooms, they must be carried out in high-quality printing in indoor rooms also with tunnel approval, reports the ERR news portal.
The banner reads: “A gift to Estonian schools in commemoration of the first Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 tickets is 20,000 euros, or a ticket will cost 35 euros.
Murder of journalist highlights rising danger in Mexico
The weekly Riodoce staff usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the state’s most recent chaos sowed by organized crime, corrupt officials, and endless drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They are told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are discussing which one seems safer: whether to bring the children with them to the office, which was the target of a 2009 grenade attack, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the front of the room: “enemy”, “neutral”, “allied”.
They ask reporters to provide names in each column – no evidence is needed, impressions and insight are enough.
Drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being paid by the government or cartels—a whole list of villains who make it dangerous to reflect Mexico’s chaos.
According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, at least 25,589 journalists have been under national protection after attacks and threats, and so far at least seven journalists in seven states have been killed in that year.
Among the last dead is their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be perceived everywhere – on the Riodoce building’s facade hangs a large picture of the mid-finger pointing Valdez with the inscription “Justice” and two 30-year-old reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his characteristic panama cube.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate public prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, only two cases have been prosecuted, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, the number of which reaches thousands, journalists’ killers rarely reach trial.
The Riodoce editorial continues to reflect the violence prevailing in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data of the murderers and justice, a security meeting will not be of much benefit, Ibarra said.
"It's very stupid to waste your time here at the meeting," he says.
“Until you know the reason, you will disbelieve everyone.”
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive just a few quarters before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and was shot 12 times. This is presumably because of the newspaper name, which translated means "twelfth river".
An armed man drove into Valdez’s car and caused an accident nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, there is only silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival cliques struggle to fill the power vacuum.
It doesn’t matter if a few or even several people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloa or if the cemetery is full of richly decorated double mausoleums of drug kings, larger than the homes of many inhabitants.
Let’s forget for a moment that Peace Time refers to the time when a coastal state with valuable ports and drug routes leading to the United States is ruled by only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers involved in his work, Riodoce co-founder and chairman Ismail Bojorquez (60) feels tremendous guilt for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first was the release in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a narcissist of a cluster of cartels competing with Guzman’s sons and at war.
This post might have angered the sons—the suspected gang members purchased all copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newspaper kiosks.
Another mistake was that Valdezi was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after the arrest occurred in another newspaper issue covering the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he was alive forever.
He worked as a veteran reporter for the newspaper Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce by selling $50 shares.
Bojorquez said that in Sinaloa "it was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem."
Over time, the newspaper gained fame with its bold and honest reports, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish vigorous investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were enchanted by a print, from which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Caboti Award for its Latin American publications.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Prize of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (ACC) for his courage to follow a Mexican narcologist wherever it leads.
He openly admitted he was afraid.
“I want to live on,” he said when receiving the AKK prize.
Last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
“You have to take on the task of being a journalist – the other option is to play a fool.
I don’t want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn’t tell you what was going on.”
The Riodoce collective is missing Valdez, a joke man who robbed like a madruse, a friend who kindly shared embassies and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office across the road to the El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love has become fateful for him.
His death has also made them question themselves how to do their job best and stay alive.
“They don’t like to get stuck with their wives, their children, their legitimate, their secret landings used to transport drugs.”
“These things shouldn’t have been touched,” Bojorquez said.
The result is strong self-censorship and self-preservation, even in the best of times.
Trusting your instincts.
If the thing smells suspicious, keep it away.
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that “the sense of smell can be deceived... and that’s what happened to Javier.”
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply to Sinaloa, just as they do not apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, or other states that are home to the toxic cluster of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff gathered for security training, cell phones were suddenly no longer allowed; days before it was revealed that spyware sold solely to governments had been used to track journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers sought relief in the shade of a tree from the 40-degree heat.
The government assigned them to guard the Riodoce office, located in a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacani.
Some reporters questioned whether these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself has labeled unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have travelled to the mountainous countryside where de facto control is in the hands of drug gangs.
Riodoce’s issue this week addressed three main issues.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor’s hometown.
And in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacán, a quarter away from the prosecutor’s office, a group of people were kidnapped.
There was no official announcement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so you had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows – the restaurant is a favorite place for both drug dealers and the authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for almost the entire past century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption as part of widespread court cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at the same location, including how Guzman’s son, who was nicknamed El Chapo, escaped from military service.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched for the Valdez column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We'd already know what happened before," said the 46-year-old Villarreal, whose cluttered bodybuilding has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has become a storehouse for labels and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and the editorial staff has become something they could never expect – activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few pounds and headed to the local prosecutor’s office the next morning to protest for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the killing of Valdez.
A burnt body has been found, and officials say it belongs to him, according to DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more voiced and cry out the phrase "SOS press" on the sidewalks and buildings as an organized protest.
On that day, Chairman Bojorquez is out in Washington, trying to gather international support to bring justice to the Valdez case.
A day after Valdez’s death, in a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of bullying and killing journalists for speaking the truth.
After that, he requested that he be directed away from the reflection of government activities, worried that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are “restricted” by organized crime, co-guilty government officials, and the indifferent society.
In his latest book, “Drug Journalism,” he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but are also killed by politicians and security forces who are involved in organized crime.
The media monitoring group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and government officials.
“In Mexico, you’re dying because you’re being silenced,” Ramirez said.
The murders are bloody.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter allegedly signed by the Los Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my reports."
Next to his broken head lay a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others go on, as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke publicly to the drug cartels with a headline on the front row, "What do you want from us?".
Some journalists have fled their homelands or even the country.
This is a nervous decision.
In exile, it’s hard to find work and they still have to sneak out on the streets to avoid the dangers.
And sometimes they are pursued, as probably happened to photographer Ruben Espinos, who was murdered with four women in 2015 in an apartment in Mexico three months after escaping from Veracruz.
Those who stay in place and continue to work will have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that the reflection of the drug business scares her.
“Mexico is on its way to hell and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight on one recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked, the Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when suddenly everyone’s phones started vibrating.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people were killed in the fire between rival gangs and security forces, according to confirmed data.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by several messages left by cartels found in the region.
From the same side of the walkway, reporters uploaded the news on the Riodoce website using their mobile phone.
The next day I needed a change.
The sirens were whispering by another fire in the area.
Bojorquez stumbled toward the guarded policemen to see if they were alert.
If they were afraid, they didn’t show it at least.
Under the massive portrait of the falling founder of the newspaper, with his middle finger visible throughout Sinaloa, Riodoce’s staff edited in his footsteps.
“How could you think of closure at all,” Bojorquez said, “if on the same day that Javier was killed, a trainee asked me to send him to the streets to report?”
Dinosaurs used protective paint to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a shape, although quite frightening.
Scientists have now revealed the first finds related to the incredible nasal-size creature discovered by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
It’s so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered by her beads was red-brown and her past had been somewhat “complicated.”
A report published in the journal Current Biology described the creature as “the best-preserved army dinosaur ever found” and as “one of the best dinosaur monuments in the world.”
For the fossil, it is a new species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous Age, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation haunted scientists who describe it as “truly remarkable.”
This peat-covered vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil of this type ever found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk while mining at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
He struck something that did not resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to examine more closely.
The found fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The next six years were spent working on excavating the animal from a 2,500-pound (1100-kilogram) plot.
After all this hard work, the final result is finally ready to be made public.
"If you kiss a little eye, you can almost believe he's asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is being exhibited.
"It goes into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur monuments - the dinosaur's Mona Lisa."
By examining his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore, which is covered with bars and resembles a walking tank, was likely significantly threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
This dinosaur with a large armpit used red and white protective colours to hide from predators, and used a shadowing technique called shadowing, which is also used by many modern animals.
This, according to experts, allowed the dinosaur to fuse better into the surroundings and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
This 110-million-year-old creature belonging to the family of nodosaurs first reached the news in May and is now available for visits at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory worker at the Borealopelta Markmitchell Museum, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours exposing the animal.
Thanks to the surprisingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the spots on the animal’s body.
They discovered resistance, a method of defense common in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper side of the being was darker than the lower.
Although the shadowing is common, the findings come as a surprise, as the Borealopelta is much larger than the shadowed animals that live today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was actively hunted by other meat-eating dinosaurs enough that evolution preferred hiding rather than confrontation as a survival tactic.
However, the majority of modern-day animals that use resonance - such as deer, zebras or armadillas - are much smaller and more vulnerable to the harvest, suggesting that the nodosaurus had to really struggle to survive.
“The vigorous hunt for an incredibly large dinosaur, covered with abundant shrubs, shows how dangerous crete dinosaur predators could have been,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the Finns' organic compounds also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was red-brown.
Scientists are continuing to investigate the animal to get clues about its life, including the preserved content of its intestines, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river when he died, thus reaching the ocean with a stream, where he sank in front of the backbone to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were probably extending much further into the interior than they are now.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved hernial skin, while also remaining three-dimensional, retaining the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal looks almost the same today as it was in the Crete era.
You don’t need much imagination to reconstruct it – just kiss your eyes and it looks like it’s asleep.”
In the Cretaceous era, there were huge two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs – teropods.
Although the king of all of them, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its terrifying predecessors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 meters) tall and six-ton monster weighing.
Scientists, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was flooded into the sea after death and it mummified in mud.
It was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk while mining at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, this is the best-preserved army dinosaur in the world, including leather and armpits, and it’s complete from the cone to the hips.
These creatures were an average of 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
From his shoulders came out two 20 inches long clocks.
Scientists believe that this herbivora, covered with pine trees, travelled through present-day Western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea.
However, the dinosaur's underwater burial site helped preserve its trees in excellent detail.
The stoned remains of this particular specimen have been so well preserved that skin remains are still covered along the dinosaur’s heads of mushrooms.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine, “This degree of preservation is as rare as a lottery win.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The stoned skin remains still cover the mushrooms placed on the animal’s skull.
The right front foot lies next to him and the five toes are stretched upwards.
I can count the fingers on his feet."
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Who's the streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell suffered a total shock.
Just a day after traveling to New York, this resident of St. Louis sat on the bed in a room rented through Airbnb, browsing Facebook on his phone.
He got after his former schoolmate’s post.
It read, “The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he still lies on the street.”
She was confused about why no one else had posted this information to her stream, so she shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
Pidemega @TheePharoah's posts were repeatedly forwarded on his timeline.
The St. Louis region rapper broadcasted a real-time video of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black young man killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
“It’s crazy,” Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He put his phone off, but later in the evening saw the soundtracks again, this time announcing a gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
They shared photos of police birds and screaming people, and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and held a note with "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a stream in real time where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a roaring dog.
In another video, another police officer whispered with a gun and yelled, “I’ll kill you all... animals.”
Ferrell remembers how he hit himself with the thought, “It’s unusual.”
“It’s not the kind of murder we’re used to and we might call typical.”
I felt scary at that moment.
I was angry and I was crying.”
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
Having landed at 23 a.m., he went to his father for his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would fly alone to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is central to the new documentary “Who’s Streets?” that premieres in cinemas on August 11.
It’s a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of the people who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter, who wore a flowery dress and had a crown on their head, drove to Ferguson, they talked again about what they had repeatedly talked about before that morning: the experiences and living conditions of the Negroes.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
“I couldn’t not take him with me,” Ferrell said later.
“What is happening now is... a culmination of what happened in the past.
He must know and see it and grow in the midst of it.
He must learn about activism and organizing, and at the same time know the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we need to do to become free and free ourselves.
Even if I can raise her so that she doesn’t personally experience racism, she doesn’t differ from any other black girl.
I feel like I'd make him a hole if I protected him from this world."
The first stop they made when they arrived in Ferguson was on the South Florisant road, a place across the road from a police station that had become a kind of campsite where activists were waiting for news about police officer Darren Wilson, who was ultimately not charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunch.
They put together food bags and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
“My activism changed completely after August 9,” she said, noting that when she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Union of Minority Nursing Students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I did not have any organizational experience.
It’s all just flawed.”
Weeks later, Ferrell met with one of the film co-directors, Sabaah Folayan, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was happening.
The question arose in Ferrell’s head: “Are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited?”
Such skepticism was due to the countless cases in which people — often white people — came into the community and sought to benefit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not heard and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already struck hands with co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism in relation to death-prisoners.
His involvement made the project appealing to Ferrell and six other locals who were watched by the film’s “Who’s Streets?” team for years after Brown’s shooting.
“In this documentary, no one is talking for us or with us, we are talking for ourselves,” Davis said.
“For me, it was important how these people are depicted, because that is how I am depicted.”
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience – it was to show that the movement was not “to lead the Redeemer, but to gather the community,” as Folayan said – he became the most open-minded actor in the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" surprisingly documents personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw the finished linen.
"But I realized that doing this work and humanizing black people must be accompanied by some vulnerability."
Furthermore, Ferrell’s story emphasizes and again focuses on the role of a black gay woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement, who came up with the theme #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the murder of a black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, are homosexuals.
“The leadership of black gay women has kept the movement on the ground,” Ferrell said, “and this is precisely because we have to fight on multiple fronts.
Black gay women must bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is really kept alive by black women, and many of them are black gay women."
At the same time, he argues that "it's not a kind of equal opportunity creation thing" - Ferrell wasn't chosen to be the focus of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person from whom the right energy was blowing out," he said.
“But it’s not a coincidence that she was right on the front line, because as a black gay woman, there’s a lot at stake living in such hubs.
His energy can be perceived through the screen.”
At the same time, news cameras from Ferguson have long been gone, but racial ties between the community and the police remain fragile.
The conditional sentence imposed on Ferrell for blocking the road during the demonstration will last for another 2.5 years.
He describes the social-political atmosphere in the region, which he calls home, simply “dry.”
Nevertheless, he still holds the mantra he has carved into his memory since he walked out on the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
7 Ways to Get Over After a Weekend Party
Some stronger boys find after a drunken party, that which trouble, that help.
The old saying goes, “Avoid the crap, stay drunk.”
But this is only an inevitable delay and a decent blow to health.
What can you do to feel better in the morning after today and tomorrow’s weekend troll – or other party – and get over the pohmell as painlessly as possible?
Drink the water.
Alcohol down and off, after a big party in the morning ... or maybe even instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when consuming alcohol, it must somehow be recovered.
Along with water, minerals are also removed from the body and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after drinking, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only slightly carbonized.
Go to walk.
Certainly it’t cost to go to the grandmother with a pohmell to tear down trees – it could turn out to be a fateful wrong decision.
But a light walk helps your body remember what it feels like to be alive.
Lying in the tent and leaving the stool out is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give your body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you are already getting branched from yesterday’s overdrinking, it’s definitely not worth trying to load a large fat steak on your stomach.
For example, start with fresh juice, which contains fruit sugars that calmly stir your body.
If your health is already suffering at lunchtime, you could try, for example, a bouillon.
A little later, the back.
Avoid the coffee.
This diuretic will free your body from the last water.
Water and juice are your friends.
Do not use pain remedies.
If you take painkillers in the evening, your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and will lose performance.
This will damage your liver even more, and in the future, the bugs will be even worse.
In addition, the pain reliever does not remain in the body for a long time.
If you take pain medication in the morning, don’t do it on an empty stomach – it will irritate your already upset stomach.
If you don’t have a partner, you can get along well with yourself.
It works in the same way as walking, but you can’t get an orgasm by walking.
However, avoid overly active rhythms and crazy poses - during a hike, physical effort should be moderate.
make a joke.
Talk stupidly with friends, do simple nonsense, and laugh friendly about yourself and others (suffering).
Jokes and laughter may not dispel you, but they are more fun to endure.
Someday the poem goes over anyway.
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee are being sought for murder
Police say a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee are being sought nationwide as suspects after finding the dead body of a man in a Chicago luxury apartment.
According to Cooke County court documents, warrants were issued on Monday for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren accused of first-degree murder for their alleged association with the deaths of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated beating.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police received a telephone call and found a victim with several torch wounds on the body when they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment house.
Officials said Cornell-Duranleau was found dead on the scene, and investigators are treating it as murder, while police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked at Northwestern University since 2007 as a co-professor of microbiology and immunology.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of public relations at the University, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now temporarily removed from work and is banned from entering the towns of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case under investigation by the competent authorities and the University of Northwestern is working with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant at the Department of Finance at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in a statement e-mailed: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to help U.S. investigative agencies in every possible way."
In addition, the statement said Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to release himself.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the communications department of the Chicago police station, urged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but we are working on determining the exact location more and more intensively," Guglielmi said.
According to Gugliel, local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager who had just received a cryptographic hint that something had happened in apartment number 1008.
According to police, it was a blatant sighting.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident itself occurred on July 27.
He said security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren's presence in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
Grand Plaza's management sent a letter to the residents: "Police is currently working to identify the chronology of events and the victim's background, and is investigating various motives, including the possibility that it was a family slaughter."
Idol companies that help your business avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the polls were successful.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, misleading.
And even though he promised to guarantee anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
“This system just wasn’t consistent and objective,” said Errett, who heads e-commerce company Madison Reed, which sells hair care products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called on external people to help.
There are emerging new types of human resource startups that help companies figure out what their employees feel about.
By developing and licensing software with a firm goal of measuring employee engagement, they enable companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hotline for filing complaints, and in some cases allow speakers to bypass C-level managers and contact the board directly.
“Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your business?” asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City’s startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
According to Errett, in the three years he has used Glint, he has gained a much better insight into what his employees think and feel.
In addition to out-of-the-box surveys and specific teams-oriented surveys, it offers a company heat card that provides insight into which departments have the most complaints and which executives have the lowest support, allowing it to figure out the reasons.
Companies have begun to realize that they need to stay up to date with their working culture in order not to become the next Uber to have been plunged into scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing a harassing environment in which those who dared to speak were punished.
For startups like Glint, the desire to have insight is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global governance, regulation and compliance could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Financial Technology Statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a Colorado-based startup that helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity this year against the backdrop of Uber’s dubious reputation.
Convercent has 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent allows companies to send tailored pulse surveys, collect real-time confidential answers, and view heat maps from problematic areas.
It also provides an anonymous message line that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
And if the case concerns the executive, complaints go directly to the management board.
“Public opinion has been hijacked by regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said if a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycott, employee withdrawal, and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and operations and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or email address of the headquarters of the company, submit an official complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously.
It was often a discouraging and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday general adviser James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, however, it is possible to identify and address problems such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair pay practices that did not reach managers who operated in offices in other cities or states earlier.
“I’m able to get closer to the staff’s holistic 360-degree experience,” said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"And we will protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said companies began to take ethical behavior, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, after auditing firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But it wasn’t until “social media matured” that companies realized they couldn’t prevent their black clothes from being washed publicly online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking periodic fees from companies for using their products.
It is a business model and opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supporting both startups.
Convercent was funded by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital for $10 million in February, raising the amount of capital raised by $47 million.
Glinti invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, raising the company’s total funding to $60 million.
Such investments are not surprising given the interrelationship between, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that today’s workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are merely on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they dedicate their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy in a company, feel that they’re being listened to and that the work they’re doing is rewarding, they’re more committed to ensuring the company’s success,” said Nina McQueen, a vice president of the overall benefit and employee experience department at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make revenue when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies do well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder they find support.
Having data on employee involvement is important, according to work culture experts.
However, these data are useless if the company’s supervisors don’t do anything with them.
In fact, when a company asks its employees for feedback, it can generate expectations that changes are ahead.
And if changes do not happen quickly enough or not at all, it can lead to disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
“If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, president of Kotter International, a consultancy and business management company, who has seen how companies make the mistake of relying on too much data.
"Because when things don't end up, employees will think, 'Did you really listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don’t care, why should I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly surveys among employees, has been able to take action on the same day the problem was through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees disappointed in the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and provide communication training to address problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, collects new data on employees and is expected to lead to a longer-term commitment of employees to an industry known for its high workforce flow.
“If you’re not committed to transparency, you’re losing people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.”
Baltic countries are the bright star of the euro area: income is growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic countries, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the incomes of the wealthy countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes, citing a report from the European Central Bank.
Since 1999, the GDP per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Success is driven by low debt burden, rapidly improving institutions, and business and free market-friendly policies.
“The Baltic countries, along with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where real GDP per capita on purchasing power is significantly close to the EU average,” the central bank said in a statement.
Although the goal is to equal the GDP per capita of the wealthier Western Europe, in 2015, the Baltic economies accounted for only two-thirds of the average of the 15 countries that were members of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle.
Low wages have led Balkans to seek better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic countries in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, the locals are not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvians and Lithuanians estimate that their economies are going very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, a little less than half of respondents thought so about the economies of their own countries.
NCAA's decision to cancel twice-a-day workouts makes Bruins' days long
It’s almost 23 a.m. when a troupe of UCLA footballers stops to chat on the edge of the team’s new training field on campus.
Some of them have peeled off their shirts, exposing their sweat back from the first day of their training camp effort.
For a large part of the team, these power moments provide a lunch break.
Players attending summer courses will go back to the dorm after three hours of training to study for final exams before returning to the Wassermann Football Center for meetings the next morning at 6.30.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA’s decision to cancel training sessions twice a day to reduce players’ load has actually made their days longer – at least until they get one-half of the final exam on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA’s first three training sessions were scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to fit the players’ already tight schedule.
Switching from two workouts a day means more one workout days – the start of the Bruins training camp was pushed almost a week ahead of the previous season, and for the first time in Mora’s six Westwood seasons, training takes place during summer courses.
They have 18 training sessions scheduled until August 20 before the official preparations for the opening game against Texas A&M begin in September.
Mora said he is in favour of the NCAA rule change, although it adds another item to the tight schedule of players.
"They have a huge load for three or four days and it's a serious challenge," Mora said.
"And they break themselves through this trial; they struggle, they are beautiful young men.
I think if Saturday comes and we have more time, it’s really nice.”
Once the camp is over, UCLA will shut down the training sessions, which is not an easy task at all, given the clear view of their fields from the nearby parking lot and adjacent Luskini Center, a superior-class hotel that has already been struck by the defensive net around the gate.
From that weekend on, the hotel has been occupied by the Bruins players, but Mora admitted that there could be problems with free rooms during the season.
“We are implementing security measures,” Mora said.
“It’s a real concern and it’s not an exaggeration to think that people can rent a room and film their workouts.
If you have a record of training, it can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we use the security team there and on the 8th parking lot.
We make the best use of what is available.
I try not to worry much about this.
We have a plan.”
Savisaare-Ivanova electoral alliance, born in retaliation for the Central Party, Kristiina Ojulandi, expelled from the Reform Party and Maria Kaljuste, forced to leave EKRE, created in the unification of forces Our Tallinn and the businessmen's electoral alliance Tegus Tallinn, which hopes to show the parties - it seems that the electoral alliance created on the initiative of those who have burned in party politics will participate in this year's local elections at least as much as the parties.
The chickens, however, are counted in autumn, and the key question is whether they all have enough disappointed voters.
Who will stay with Savisaar?
How small the support group of Edgar Savisaare has been reduced, can be guessed from the events organized in honor of his electoral union.
One member of the parliament, a few former and current middle-party members and many unknown faces – can this be the composition of the electoral union?
And can the reason why some of Savisaare’s loyal supporters and friends are holding aside from the candidacy in Tallinn be sought from the fact that the “Savisaare list”, headed by corrupts and suspects of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the district government for a Russian-language pop song with the participation of an elder of the Lasnamäe district; and in every sense an original computer game in which the main character, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, must avoid the bumps and eagles on the road while riding – is this the first time that the Central Party seeks the votes of 16- and 17-year-old voters allowed to vote?
We will be waiting to see what other parties think of the youth-based election campaign.
If the viewers of Channel 2 or TV3 will see a black square instead of entertainment from the beginning of August, there are two options: agree that in the future only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English-language France24 channels will be shown on free broadcasts, or hand over a dozen every month to a few telephone operators.
There are probably those who initially publicly rejoice about the advertising-free TV experience, but ultimately – though reluctantly – pay for TV images and advertisements.
Stunning music, loud people and rubbish left on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don’t want to be a part of the noise yourself, it’s worth exploring home instead of headaches at home – and leaving a sleeping place for a large sum to the festival guests.
Washington changes the rules of the green card
The media cited President Donald Trump as saying he is planning a new U.S. immigration plan that will change the rules of the green card.
The plan includes reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules on access to temporary forms of work, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill will be debated in two houses of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayer money by changing the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and start to replace the current program.
The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Siberian seto youths move to the city, retirees back to the country.
Yevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous seto gold miners along the river Maana.
He works 140 kilometers from home as a driver in a gold cartel on the side of the Maana river Kuvai.
It is hard work: two months in a row without days of rest, 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and back again.
In his three years at Artell, Anatoli has only seen gold once.
"There's a tough order: when you go in, you're thoroughly checked not to bring vodka, and when you go out, you're checked not to take gold," says Anatoli.
Mare Piho talks with local seto Jaan in the village of Haida, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The archaic culture still preserved by the Siberian setos is also beginning to affect the home setos, because it is just so stunning, thinks Piho Mare, who has studied the remote setos most thoroughly.
His first exploratory trip to Siberia is 30 years old this year.
During that time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for a total of a year.
How many settlers still migrated to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I think 8,000.
I counted it out from the stories of the Siberian seto men who have thought about it themselves.
It is difficult to say exactly, because at the time up to 30 people could come in a group, but the passport was given only to a man.
The passport was given to only one, but with him were children, sisters, and other female relatives.
Look at how large this area was!
It was several times larger than the historical Setom.
They had to be educated and managed in some way.
The Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they entered areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (ball painting), gold mines, industry.
In New Petersburg, for example, many settlers later went to work in the secret city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (there the Soviet power built a uranium enrichment plant - J. P.), when it was formed.
Were the Seths the majority of the population in the region at that time?
They lived compactly.
In addition, there is a long tradition of marriage and multi-child marriage.
Seven or eight children in a family.
How much was the culture of the Siberian cedar different and different from that of the native cedar?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of popular ideas.
They did so themselves, but they always made a distinction between what was brought and what was done here.
Climate change has strongly influenced the traditional clothing of the setes, because it is colder here.
The food changed.
For example, in Setom, meat was salted, but here it was simply frozen.
Where are the villages in Siberia and what life is there?
The connection with the motherland was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this SetLand begins to give back to it, it begins to affect them.
Those girls who have lived here in families have heard amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Set delegation who came to Haida at the beginning of July for the day of the Kingdom of Seto and lived in the homes for four days.
What’s left here is amazing.
“It’s very easy to come and go because the city has a great location: at a railway node and at the intersection of roads,” says Reigo Tamm, an opera soldier from Tapal.
The city has long been no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural sites, and pizza can be found in every corner.
It is a top city!
Along the White River, which runs through the city, there is a small island where slaughterhouses are accustomed to hold a barbecue feast.
“This beautiful place doesn’t look like a railway railway,” Reigo remembers.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in the river, because the river is full of springs.
I’ve been swimming there and it’s fine.
On the bank of the river you can have a picnic and just have a romance - you can look at the flow of the river and think about life ahead and behind.
I went out there with my brides.
Among other things, Tamm from the opera house has been on the river bank between three bridges to practice his aria: "Because this place is on the outskirts of the city, nobody will come back if I round my own stories."
"From the Männikumäge there is a wonderful view of Tapal, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in the winter and currently play, for example, discgolf - the golf course is done, discs can be borrowed from the sports centre," he leads Reigo.
The old professionals go there with their discs, of course, but I haven’t been there yet to play.
Probably colleague Rasmus Kull Tapal should be invited because he is an experienced discgolf player and he has records.
He borrowed me.
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable in the time of the present opera artist’s childhood.
At least during the skiing.
There are a lot of tears left on this mountain, disappointments and you can win in my sport.
Not to mention the broken skirts and skirts.
“The whole city centre is currently full of construction work, all of which is becoming unknown,” says Reigo.
However, the old and tired house of Kapa is a very attractive place to play summer games.
I am pleased that in 2012 R.A.A.A.M. Director Märt Meos accepted my idea and had to make a summer theater with his theater in the station.
Although this year's theatre season "Alexey with Karenina" has just ended, on August 11th there will be "Awakening" at the railway station when the old building of the garage moves around in the 1980s.
"The days from 11 to 13 August are Tapa city days, during which the open home cafes and cultural events, including popular rallies, will take place after the wake of the hospital building," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old in those days.
In the small yellow house on the 1 May street, the museum has been operating since 1994.
“The house is small, but there are plenty of exhibits and a lot of information,” says Reigo, a place full of Tapa’s history, most of which focuses on rail and military.
Reigo says that if Tapal goes through all the recommended places, the stomach will soon go empty, but fortunately the small town is full of cafes.
“We have such good places to eat and when you sit in cafes, sometimes you feel like you’re abroad,” he describes.
Educated and young soldiers who came to Tapal spend a lot of time in pubs-cafés, therefore, sitting there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but around there is such an international community together.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we are moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
TV channel bTV quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying that two Bulgarians had been arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, police arrested a group of people illegally camped on the Sithonia peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but an investigation is underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing harsh fines on anyone who is stuck to rest in a place not intended for this purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The wolves who teach puppies break the sheep.
After a year’s break, farmers in Hieland have to give the wolves “learning material” from their flocks again – apparently the wolves who taught puppies have already broken a bunch of sheep.
This year, wolves have broken sheep three times in Hiiu County, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the number was only three, a year earlier 124.
In sync with the breaches are also data from the environmental agency that no wolf beetles were born in Himalaya last year and information from the Himalayan hunting council that two wolf beetles have been fixed on the island this year.
In the night of Monday, wolves broke 15 sheep from the village of Kabuna in the Emmaste municipality and wounded 18 of the surviving sheep.
Early on Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in the herd of the village of Reheselja and seriously injured another, who had to make an emergency strike.
Rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs has submitted to the coordination circle a draft law amending the Act on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment will eliminate the creation of a separate database for sites of genetically modified (GM) crops as well as for operators, and will use the plant health register for this purpose.
In addition, the obligation of an operator of GM crops to have a prior agreement with a person engaged in beekeeping within a specified radius is amended.
Although genetically modified crops are not currently grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least until Estonia has decided to declare it GMO-free," said Sigmar Suu, head of the plant health department at the Ministry of Agriculture.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden incurred by both the private and public sectors," Suu added.
The bill repeals the provisions relating to the data collection and training of GM crops sites and operators in GMOVS, sets requirements for the handling of GM crops and the commencement of economic activity.
Specifically, with regard to beekeeping, the previous obligation of a GM farmer to inform beekeepers of the beginning of the cultivation of a GM crop will be replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before the start of the cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to get acquainted with it in the draft information system and, if desired, submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes will affect, in particular, those operating in the plant farming sector, beekeepers and the Agricultural Agency.
In the European Union, only one GM crop is allowed to grow, MON 810.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops.
This is due to the fact that in Estonia there is no maize pest, the European strawberry, to which the maize line MON 810 is resistant.
Also, the varieties of this corn line are bred for the southern regions, and this may not be suitable for our climatic conditions.
In order to obtain preliminary certainty, the Ministry of Rural Affairs ordered studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination with GMOs in the seeds of various varieties of corn, soybeans and soybeans grown in Estonia.
Analysis results of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and as a result of the study, it was concluded that the seeds of raps, corn and soy varieties grown in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
It can, in turn, be concluded from the foregoing that there are no consciously cultivated genetically modified crops in Estonia and it has also been confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho Thinks Manchester United Recruited "Genius" in the Form of Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Matic as a "genius" after his midfielder Sampdoria debut on Wednesday night.
The player, purchased from Chelsea for £40 million, started a 2-1 win in the first round in the last pre-season game of United in Dublin before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressing in a defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on running races.
But after staying aside from Blues' pre-season Asia tour, Matic was severely lacking in the match form and he only stood for 45 minutes. This must be fixed before the Premier League season begins, Mourinho said.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant mindset - he has a football mindset," Mourinho said.
"We will help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new recruits, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, also started the start-up at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho began quietly putting his eleventh start-up man in place for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed that the club has already done a “great job” by signing contracts with three of his four priority choices.
"I'm grateful to the club for being able to make three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier when they can do four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another gender boy got a foot on the GSM transmitter on August 1, and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird observer living in Sõrve, the first bird boy received an escort in Sõrve, and this group is already flying around, has left the baseball site and joined the large nightclub of Mullutu-Suurlahe.
This is because there is no fruit field in Sörö, writes Voice of the Islands.
That Tuesday, already relatively late to ring the cucumbers, another puppy boy came to the sender, and it was on Muhu Island.
According to Martinson, the installation of the escorts is actually an international project, carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, there was a boy named Mati equipped with a GSM transmitter in Sõrvos Turku.
"His actions can be viewed on the internet: how he went to winter in Spain, returned for a long time on the German-Polish border and then came to the island," Martinson said.
The British inventor installed a microchip in his body to access the house and car with a bracelet
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be installed with a microchip so that he could simply open his forehead with a bracelet, enter the office, and even start a car.
33-year-old Steven Northam installed a small chip between his thumb and name finger and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant-anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hanze, Winchester, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also replaces the locks of houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, asking for £300 for one lock.
This married father of one child has now installed the technology both at home and in his car, the BMW Z4, which starts when he’s on the wheel.
The White House exhibition cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to military documents released by TIME, the White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000 for the event celebrating American production.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, dubbed the Marine One when the president was on board, was the central drawback of the event that showcased American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials were on a tour to innovate industrial products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-built helicopter was exhibited together with a Maine hunt, a Wisconsin fire car, and a Mississippi-made cable lift.
According to documents from the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the squadron responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House military cabinet requested the presence of the helicopter with FARGO about 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern courtyard for an “unusual” event.
“I wanted you to be aware of this because it’s an unusually high attention event,” the HMX-1 commander said in an email to his commander, the Navy’s deputy senior aviation officer, a day before the event.
The message said the helicopter would arrive in the southern courtyard on July 17 for an event starting around 7 a.m. at 15 p.m. and would remain there until the courtyard was cleaned between 18 and 21 p.m. on the same evening.
Added was the fact that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the restrictions on working hours.
The original flight crew was on the helicopter at the time of the incident, and the squadron security crew remained close to the aircraft for the entire time it was on the ground.
From the documents given to TIME, it was not possible to read out whether another crew would eventually be needed or not.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents indicate that HMX-1 investigated whether the event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it violated Hatch's law, and we were told not to violate," the commander wrote.
“You seem to have no choice,” the deputy chief officer replied.
The White House declared the event "Made in America" as an official event and the Hatch Act would not cover it.
But even official events have political undertones.
At the event, the president supported the efforts for healthcare reform that were being discussed in the Senate at the time and praised efforts to keep the government’s regulations in line.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically lucrative purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for a photo session is unusual.
Trump came under the spotlight in February when a presidential plane crashed in the background during his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is rubbed with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the presidential plane.
“The White House is very pleased with the ‘Made in America’ exhibition featuring products from all 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, spokeswoman for the White House.
HMX-1 crews frequently make trial flights around Washington and in the Southern Court to practice crossing to the White House of the President of the United States with centimeter accuracy.
While Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 trials in the White House courtyard.
According to the official, the flight for the event was included in the "made in America" flight crew training flight norm that month.
The squadron’s helicopters flew on that day for an additional 11 hours for “non-President-related support missions.”
According to the White House, no other exhibition of this event loaded the taxpayer’s wallet.
According to a spokesman for Sikorsky, the company was not involved in organizing an exhibition in the southern courtyard of the helicopter.
The HMX-1 does not retain budget documents for presidential flights, and the exact costs incurred by the event are difficult to figure out.
But according to the Defense Ministry’s hourly prices for the 2017 fiscal year, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
The records indicated that the flight was 30 minutes from its main naval base at Quantico airport in both directions from Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount.
“Calculating taxpayer costs based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading,” said Walters.
"These estimated compensation rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that will be taken into account in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Defense Ministry’s compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event at the time.
“The point is to show things made in America this week,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security and that there are probably hundreds, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it is right to highlight this.”
It is unclear whether or not Trump collided with a helicopter during a tour in the southern courtyard, but he was sitting behind the wheel of a fire car.
Inside the White House, Trump turned to representatives of Sikorsky, joking at the media about the company’s products in his personal fleet of aircraft.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said, “I have three of their products.”
Grit Šadeiko - Through tears came peace and joy
At the 2011 World Cup, Daegus hit Shadeiko in the final area, ran a foot crash at 800 meters and was taken off the stadium with a bearing frame.
Shortly before that, he had won zero in a distance jump at a universiade held in China.
In 2012, the Helsinki European Championship was broken by an injury, but at the Olympic debut in London, he was ranked 23rd with 6013 points.
But the misfortune continued.
The 2013 Moscow World Cup received a thumb injury in a distance jump by an Estonian who was on the record chart after the opening day.
Two years later, he took the 15th place at the Beijing World Cup and met the Olympic standard, but it was also a disappointment for the athlete.
Shadeiko did not go through the hardest run until last year, when he was unable to record the start of the long-distance jump in the Amsterdam EM.
I would just like to make a good multiplayer.
“Once upon a time,” said Shadeiko.
Worse was ahead: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was interrupted due to a hip injury already at the first barrier.
Is it time to continue with the 7th round?
Is two days worth it?
She thought for a long time, but found peace.
I got my head clean.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I’ve thought that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal yourself and clean your mind.
“I knew I’t put the pill in my bag yet,” Shadeiko says of her self-cleansing.
I was able to turn a clean page and move on with a new pace.
Coach Anne Mägi said it was very difficult to see the sufferings of the caregiver, but she understood that the athlete must first and foremost come to terms with himself.
He was so overwhelmed by everyone.
It was hard to endure.
"Grit, however, said that he will not give up and he wants to prove what he deserves," says Mägi.
Now there is some peace in him.
He does it for his own pleasure.
She returned from the competition in May, when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6,280 points in the Götzise multi-running.
In the high-level competition, he improved his personal top mark in bullet jump by a meter (13.89) and ran in a barrier run close to a record time.
Then the multi-competitor felt that it was not the capability ceiling at all, but only the initial competition impression was deleted.
He, who has been guiding him for years, says that Shadeiko is a model student.
He is a good athlete and is well trained.
If something is wrong or wrong, he will say it right away.
He knows his body and trusts his mind.
We have to start from that.
I can’t say exactly what to do and we’ll follow it.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
“I’m not the kind of person who does the maximum in training,” he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right sensation, because it also ensures a good result.
The baby’s happiness makes you happy
Good emotions have also been brought to Shadeik by the happiness of his relatives.
Both his former co-worker Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-competitor has received support from new climate citizens.
“It has been very interesting,” says Shadeiko.

It’s not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the “very active” process of tasting wine.
By smelling a glass, turning the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and perceiving the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Sheppard, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but taste is generated by the way wine stimulates the brain.
He compares how the brain “see” colors.
“Taste is not in wine, taste creates the flavor of wine,” Sheperd says.
Things that still affect the appearance of wine taste are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, insists that wine is not to be full.
“There needs to be more in action,” he says.
If you take too much, the system is over-saturated.
Excessive wine drinking can hurt the brain rather than benefit – according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine are at risk of memory loss, loss of balance, and reduced mental capacity.

UN says Afghan democracy depends on women’s role in politics
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Aid Mission, said hundreds of women are running for local council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate by emphasizing the importance of women's role," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent and be credible only if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Afghan local council elections and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban, in turn, has threatened the electoral process, which coincides with a transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year’s elections will mark the first time power is peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysomi, the strong role of women will enhance the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything more intense, both big and small.
There is always too little time together, but training with clothes is a good opportunity to combine meeting, play, closeness and burden.
And what a convenient solution – no matter where you are cruising in the summer, the lively craftsmen are always with you and remind you with their subtle voice: “Let’s do the training now!”
Start with heating - very good is the usual gold game or slipping along the beach.
The claw is the foundation for staying in the shape of the legs and buttocks – who would want to take the shape of a sandcake shaken by the waves during the summer?
Imetore is to use clothes instead of children!
First of all, it is safe and comfortable, the weight gradually increases at the same rate as the trainer's strength.
Advanced people can also do bits with pretty large children.
The child trains balance, reads repetitions, and feels fun about the opportunity to be tall and important.
Older children can also make the bits themselves.
The scope of movement is fixed by touching the ground and stretching your hands up.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the miniature to hold properly.
The child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
Plank is a rewarding, but hopelessly boring exercise for a child.
It is easy to make fun!
Game-plank: Take a long plank column from which to go through.
In fact, it is harder than usual, but much more fun to do than you can give a hand to a friend.
To add weight, you can stay on a slope, on a small slope, and also walk around in this position.
The extra weight can be put on the hips of a small child, but this exercise will provide fun for all children.
While crabs crawl on the sand, the triceps, buttocks, and abdominal muscles get a load like nuts.
The baby sits on his legs so that his body weight is evenly distributed in front and back.
They can be held by hands for safety.
Curl your legs and stretch straight up.
The beetle can fly, have fun, train balance and be a weight.
The life of a little coach is extra fun when he gets a little muzzle at every rise.
Additional weight is given by straightening the legs.
Make sure your back is in a neutral position.
Children themselves have a lot more fun doing abdominal muscles in a pair and with a plateau.
Pulse and pulse.
Monitor the child’s safety, knee position, and keep the spine in a neutral position.
All children's favorite and great fun!
This is a very effective whole body exercise.

A trip from the Philippines to the heart of fashion fans
Sweat bags are a summer classic, which has become a hit product in recent years, which a true summer buyer must hang on the tip of the hand, and to which merchants, despite its modest origin, have managed to weld a price label suitable for the hit.
A backpack is probably one of those things that everyone has ever had in their lives and the possession of which has not caused any special emotions.
It just exists, and if it does not exist, then nothing is broken.
Now, however, shoulder bags are making a real victory, and fashion fans have exchanged their fine designer bags for the summer months for rather simple shoulder bags.
This is not just a beach bag, but today it is just as popular as a street bag, and more courageous women even walk to the office with it.
At this point, however, it is worth to clarify before whether such a summer look still sits on the boss or it is worth pushing the notepad and laptop to a slightly more formal sumad.
The variation has made shoulder bags a true summer love for women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that comes to mind is that on a holiday trip, fashion makers first go to the local market and buy a shoulder bag, to which you will be faithful throughout the holidays and which goes with you on the beach, on the market and also with your friends on the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a larger bunch of bags from the marketplace and sell or give them to their loyal readers.
At the same time, it is worth noting that the demand for bags is so high among readers that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go hand in hand to each other to become the happy owner of a few bags.
In some ways, such madness is also understandable, because there are rarely those times when it is possible to buy something that has risen to hit status for just a few dozen euros.
True, clever merchants have also discovered an easy way to make money here, and thus the finer luxury brands also sell beer bags for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Probably so that wealthier customers should not feel like simple people who walk around with some cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a Dolce & Gabbana shoulder bag that costs more than a thousand euros.
The price for the interpretation of Chanel’s shoulder bag is around 6,000 euros.
Unlike most fashion makers, shoulder bags do not come from some of the major fashion stores, but their story began a lot further away.
The shoulder bags are said to have originated far from the Philippines, from where they have been widespreadly carried.
The red bags are mainly exported there and locals are not very often seen walking around with them.
It is said that the brewing technique dates back to the 14th century and is quite similar to ordinary basket brewing.
However, because the shoulder bag doesn’t have to rub as strongly as the basket, patterns and other materials can be blended into it, which makes the bag more personal and, therefore, more attractive.
For example, these days are especially fashionable bags that have colored straps or leather ribbons inserted into them.
The shoulder bags can send a letter of thanks to actress Jane Birkin, who has never seen the biggest shoulder bags ever.
He fitted his shoulder bag with all sorts of clothes and didn’t even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
The popularity of bags today does not play a smaller role, but also the fact that taking care of them is bad, and unlike all kinds of other sumadans, they do not have to be cared for with special tools, but the thing is also removed by water and a wet towel.
As always with trend displays, besides the classic appearance, brands have come out with all possible interpretations.
For example, if desired, you can buy a sliced ridge or rather a small shoulder.
However, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag will never go out of fashion, but the beer bag will.
What is a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries it has been considered a classic, such a bag that resembles a basket in its style, is open on the top and has short, as well as stitches, straps.

GMB worries about investment in McVitie's Glasgow factory
The trade union is expecting confirmation from the executives of cookie maker McVitie’s on long-term production plans at the company’s Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent about the future of the investment in the Tollcross facility.
The plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie’s, said they have invested more than £5 million in the object over the past couple of years.
Employees were hired there, and trade union presidents “are the first to hear” when something changes in the factory’s operations.
In a letter to the company’s facility manager, GMB Scotland appealed to McVitie’s to “dispel concerns that the funds will not be used to modernize the production lines.”
GMB Senior Organiser Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we don’t get clarity from the head of the facility regarding Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plan is deeply concerned by our members.
Families have worked here for several generations, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and the people around Glasgow, making it an essential pillar for ensuring decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social exclusion.
So in terms of jobs, wages and well-being in the eastern part of Glasgow, and in the face of Brexit, rising living costs and a chronic decline in production, McVitie urgently needs a thriving and productive company.”
A spokesman for Pladis said: “Tollcross object manager only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to him because we value active interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between employees and GMB representatives took place in Tollcross, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We then discussed with our employees that like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are continuously reviewing our activities – and this applies to all our companies and facilities – to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: “Over the past few years, we have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross facility, most of which has gone to production lines and operations improvement.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a production facility, and if there are any changes in the operation of the facility, workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about Neymar's approach?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up in attempts to attract Neymar into their ranks by making an offer of £189 million to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record-breaking conquest?
This bullish approach has opened a summer transition window and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of overtaking, set last season with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million.
Once the transition is completed, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world, starting to receive a salary of over £500,000 a week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona is known to be angry at both the approach and Neymar's release, although a source close to the Catalan board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the player since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world about such a possibility three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs that were considering recruiting some of PSG’s best players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we’ll face them and contact them,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to sign a contract with one of our players, they will face the consequences.”
Barcelona appears to have crossed that boundary as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they will not allow the Italian to leave under any conditions and that Barcelona could get a backbone as a result of that interest, losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
After Brexit, Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to hit the gap between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned during his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
“I can’t imagine who would benefit from it,” he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made possible the current free movement of people and goods, Varadkar said.
“This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders,” he said.
Varadkari said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and because it cannot, it would remain part of the European single market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to streamline Britain’s exit would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the UK, the Irish prime minister said.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: “We could have such a deal with Britain.”
The alternative would be a return to customs points, which would proclaim historical division and political failure.
“A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace,” the Irish prime minister said.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of everyday life in Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland during a visit to Belfast.
After his first semi-long triathlon, Märt Avandi: Ironman can be passed by anyone.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltic countries was held in the winter capital Otepule, when about 1,000 triathletes from more than thirty countries took part in the semi-long Ironman competition.
The 70.3 miles consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, Märt Avand won his first triathlon.
“I thought it would be difficult and it was difficult at the end,” Avandi said at the finish.
Despite the complexity, Avandi concluded that triathlon is actually accessible to almost everyone.
"It's not the distance that kills, but the pace that kills," he said, suggesting that at a reasonable pace everyone gets to the finish.
Except Ott Sepp: “Oti is physically okay, but unfortunately he can’t swim.”
He has been training hard since February.
First 4-5 hours a week, then 10 hours a week.
At 05:34:12 he reached the 270th place in the overall ranking.
Although Avandi lost both to Raio Piaggio (time 04:59:53) and to Jürgen League (time 05:06:37), he won other competitors in the so-called "class of prominents".
Tanel Padar, a “good example person” last year, lost to Avand in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), to journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (time 06:31:53 and 06:45:18, respectively).
The general winner of the Otepää stage of the Ironman series for men was crowned by the German Johannes Moldan with a time of 3:58:27, the best of the Estonians was Ivo Velik with a time of 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Danish Helle Frederiksen won with a time of 04:24:01, and the Estonian Maria Jänese, who lost to Frederiksen in almost half an hour and got a time of 04:58:58.
Avandi completed the 1.9 km swimming distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water at 410.
