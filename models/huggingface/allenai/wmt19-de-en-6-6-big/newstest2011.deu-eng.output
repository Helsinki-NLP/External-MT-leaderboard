What should it do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "confectionery".
The new city councillors from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the City Council at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has "tapped" members of the new council from the ČSSD a little, how they master the notorious slang, which has become established in recent years, in which today's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the bygone era by Mayor Pavel Bém, is borrowed from some of the best-known actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils grope somewhat in the dark about these new concepts.
At least that is what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am rather a newcomer in Prague politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new councilor for culture, reacted to the test of the "godfather vocabulary".
But the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golfloch".
"That is the only expression of the ones you have here that I use from time to time."
"Otherwise I don't think much of slang."
From the vocabulary published by the journal Aktuálně.cz in June this year, prior to the ODS election congress, the editorial staff picked out six terms, especially those notoriously connected with the Prague Municipality.
The Socialists and Democrats should define the terms' Voldemort ',' Prague's largest golf hole ',' go to the confectionery ',' bull's neck ',' betrayal of the capital 'and' bleach '.
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - initially promised to take part in the discussion, but then did not even take the listener off.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and I don't judge how the Civic Democrats talk to each other."
"For me it is important how we understand each other in the context of our programmes," he countered.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký allegedly would not have recognized in the headline mentioned above that of the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek the speech is.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all Kaucky and the only term he guessed correctly during the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka Tunnel," says Kaucký, but adds to the security: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And jokingly: "I will probably have to attend a language course."
Not only Karel Březina, but also Lukáš Plachý, the councilor for environmental issues, deciphered the "hole" correctly as the Blanka tunnel.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for, and Lukáš Plachý even guesses where this figure can be found, and thus also what it means to "go to the confectionery".
"I think that means going to some restaurant in Prague", Plachý is quite close to the solution of the puzzle, knowing that this is the seat of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he claims to have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than possessing this vocabulary.
Judging by the test participants, there does not seem to be any similarly naturalized slang among the social democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is really no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves by name, now and then we use abbreviations or nicknames," says Prague ČSSD chairman Petr Hulínský - loosely called "Hulda" by his party comrades.
"At school I was called Bříza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz tried the name and lo and behold - it works.
Councillor Weinert is for the party comrades friendly of the "grandpa" or less friendly of the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections through machinations at the party "sponsoring", is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (well-known Czech Lego "figure).
Nicknames are thus the only thing that the social democrats permit in intra-party parlance.
Hulínský does not like to be called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of Prague president.
His nickname "Doctor of rubber truncheons" allegedly has to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský earned his title Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women who are labelled as witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong more to the older generation, they cannot find work - for health reasons, for example, they are single and have no children.
When one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women are spared this, as they help with the work and give birth to children," says a nun, describing the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, where more than a hundred women are taken care of in a special home, which has been expelled by their communities.
The local government decided now to proceed against this abnormal "social measure".
For this reason, he issued a pamphlet to stop the "witch hunt".
But there is a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "derStandard" pointed out the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But to be accused of witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they doused her with kerosene and simply set her on fire.
The BBC also reported on this incident.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the matter was only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, oil used for ritual anointings was inflamed.
This happened after the group had tried to "drive an evil spirit" out of the woman.
People here support the isolation of "witches" regardless of their education.
"Der Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Female eaters of human souls are a danger both in the past and today", he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the Gambian president himself played a significant role.
"After the death of his aunt, President Yahya Jammeh started a monstrous witch hunt, as they allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He called for the help of shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the President's personal guard, forcibly abducted women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the President's farm in Kanilai," the organization Amnesty International stated in its report.
On the farm, incarcerated people were forced to drink a brew of hallucinogenic plants, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only due to international pressure that the nearly one thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the stove - nevertheless pays higher rent
An elderly squatted man is leaving the client centre of the company RPG Byty of the "Coal Baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rented apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm, a portfolio of three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is serving a prison sentence.
In the context of the so-called "deregulation", the rent was increased for all three.
Instead of 3500 crowns per month, the son is to pay 4100 crowns next year for a 2 room apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And there's not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal stove," he angrily taps at the son's new lease, which he has the power to sign.
"But what - I signed it", he explains half disgruntled and half resigned.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new lease conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7, when they will publish instructions on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man only waves away.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After the New Year, this deregulation is imminent for most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid a market-oriented rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" personally.
The RPG ’ s waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full at nine o ’ clock in the morning this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a calling device.
"Rent 2011", that's how a special keypad lights up on the touchscreen.
Just touch the button and the device spits out a number slip.
Hardly have we deciphered the number "157" and it beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it is your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room does not seem to apply to the new rent at all.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
Starting in mid-November, the envelopes with the new leases in the Ostrava region will flutter into the mailboxes of most of the tenants of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
The RPG Byty suggests to them in the letters a rent increase of approx. 15 to 38 per cent.
The special counter for new rentals in the Client Centre has been open since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's just the beginning," the ladies behind the counter answer after a moment's hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala ’ s former miners ’ homes are a hot topic.
Before the elections, Ostrava-based parliamentary vice-president Lubomír Zaorálek from the ČSSD raised this issue quite loudly, no wonder that newspapers are full of it today.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even a damp. Toilet glasses they could replace", makes the man mentioned at the beginning air.
So far, according to the staff, it is mainly pensioners who stand at the counter to see if they really get the promised rent reduction that RPG promises if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease by December 15 will also benefit from a half-reduced February lease.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overloaded with demands.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were here because of", estimate the counter officials.
RPG offers individual rental agreements, where necessary, both on its websites and on blackboards.
However, if the tenants do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not intended as a threat, but as information about the only possible and fully legitimate legal procedure," RPG explains on its websites.
"Nobody goes to court here," says one of the RPG Byty employees, and a man on the street in front of the client center at least partially agrees.
"I have a pension of 13,000 (crowns), of which 5,000 are left over for food, where should I get the money for a lawsuit," he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them through the media not to sign, so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic by New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rents is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - especially the neglect of the housing fund criticised by the angry tenants is, in the opinion of the homeowners, the main reason for the rent increase.
Whereas in the years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest four billion Euros from the income rents in the apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is supposed to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red shining information appear again and again in between.
"The rent increases in 2011 of 15% and less affect 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," says the LCD monitor.
Rent increases by 38 percent for only 400 apartments from RPG ’ s portfolio.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental rates of 19.66 CZK per square meter," argues RPG.
With 2600 apartments, the rent remains the same next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not drive up rents by leaps and bounds, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes a further obligation: All income from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in the thermal insulation.
But - first and foremost these should benefit those people who sign the agreements about the rent increase.
The architects agreed - the office also includes a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything that goes with it: colourful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design staff since last year.
The design and architectural office Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of well-known buildings in Brno originate, calculated from the first drafts for the new building Avriopoint the premises for its company, the Minikindergarten.
In wise foresight, because most of its 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is keen that the designers and architects return to their jobs as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work shorter hours, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
This makes it easier for civil engineers and architects to reconcile their demanding profession with caring for children.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of the staff of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they succeeded in winning funds from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The mini-kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the resources of the European Social Fund and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grants of CZK 2.8 million), it was possible to obtain the necessary facilities and equipment, and for a period of two years, qualified personnel and operations were provided.
After the use of the subsidies (2 years) the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue running the mini kindergarten for 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took an entire year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the application process.
The children are looked after by qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, and children can attend the kindergarten without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, may be present at the same time only 5 Children, However, the day over several children alternate with each other.
The kindergarten is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights with regard to the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program content in the mini kindergarten is still comparable to the framework program of pre-school education.
The children do not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, besides they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer at the disposal of the children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and so the stress of late collection of the children from a far away kindergarten is eliminated.
Parents therefore use their working time more productively.
No wonder natural and loyal employers, too, are forming relationships.
In this way Arch.Design ranks among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in the recruitment of new employees, are family-friendly and strengthen their personnel marketing with such programs.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The house with its organic forms got the nickname "bone house" from the local inhabitants.
Organic shapes, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, tile splinters and mosaics, the scale-like façades and the ubiquitous soft lines are all typical features of Art Nouveau by Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures, which remind of nature and living beings.
Only on closer inspection do you notice that everything is governed by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the entire façade appears even more sculptural, dramatic and the special illumination intensifies the brilliance of the colours.
The same sweeping lines and intricate shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wavy wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even peepholes and mouldings.
The Batlló House is located in the Eixample district, on the lively shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, 43, and was created by the renovation of a house built in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of a completely new one, but in the end he agreed with Gaudí ’ s idea for an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
But Antoni Gaudí did not design the Casa Batlló alone.
He collaborated with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner were created, and the use of mosaics on the façade was his idea.
However, numerous other artists and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol was also involved in the construction of Gaudí ’ s Casa Milá in Park Güell, which also contains other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion the house got the nickname "bone house" from the local inhabitants of its organic forms.
Others called it the "yawning house" because of the special window opening mechanism.
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for the house with ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces.
Their 45 degrees inclination seems a bit bizarre.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations of the time and was by no means misled by them.
Prior to the commencement of construction, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, when it was completed, the city fathers were so appalled by the result that they demanded remedy.
The councillors also stumbled upon the fact that the building with its pillars even interfered with the public sidewalk.
However, there were no changes, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the request of the district, Josep Batlló applied for permission to let the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a parlour, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building passes through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reconstruction eliminated all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and thus a larger company could chat comfortably without having to renounce a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
Due to Gaudí's reconstruction, the house received not only a new façade but also a rather unusual roof and two further floors.
Gaudí ’ s play with light is also impressive, as are the blue and white glazed tiles that cover the courtyard and the atria.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
In doing so, he simply made use of the principle that white reflects light better than dark colours, which, on the contrary, absorb sunlight.
The Casa Batlló, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005, can now be visited by anyone.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is open to the public.
The owners of the house decided to take this step only in the year, on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was discovered that this was a very profitable business, the visits were maintained and even extended to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
The price for visiting the monument is not a cardboard stick, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get a 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, you should try to make friends with one of the house inhabitants and visit him at home.
The right mattress and bed rust? Women have other wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the height, the state of health and last but not least also the sex of the sleeper.
Just as important is the interior, in which mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house, where there is no regular heating, latex mattresses are not suitable, as they take much longer to "warm up".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than standard polyurethane ， mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough ventilation tubes in the core and, moreover, lie on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is therefore not impossible that mould forms under them.
Of course, the choice also depends on what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a longer period of time, where very high soft-layer mattresses are common, will find it difficult to get used to a low hard-surface mattress.
"Probably all ice hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep properly here."
"For their abraded shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of memory foam."
"Among other things, I recommend these to people suffering from diabetes who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can hardly receive the" information "from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstery.
Therefore, I have many years ago ice hockey players, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco, Foam (Memory Foam) procured.
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered by the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don ’ t necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the foam from Visco.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it really nestles on the warm body.
Nowhere does it matter, at night you don ’ t roll around like after a heavy fight.
You simply sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (burns).
With the choice of the mattress size one should add to the height still the length of the soles of the feet, thus approx. 21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman, who are about 180 cm tall, need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm of lying width at their disposal, i.e. 180 cm together.
In the case of single beds, for example, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate.
For the sake of comfort and also for eventual visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on your back, there should be enough space for the slightly bent arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the guild master of upholsterers and interior decorators, who has been devoted for years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and also presents this topic in technical schools.
With a double bed everyone needs its own rust and its own mattress, but pay attention with the purchase, so that the mattresses are also equal in height.
Otherwise there is no other choice than to mount the grates in different heights and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, spring skeleton mattresses 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be used for the forming layer and the fine upholstery.
"You must not feel the feathers by hand or sitting down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and pad like waxed together Siamese twins have nothing to do in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already common practice today.
And since one loses between 0.2 and 0.75 litres of sweat in a single night, it is clear that the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged) sieve after five to seven years.
Also therefore specialists reject advertising slogans, which promise with mattresses a life span of up to 25 years, even lifelong warranty.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice of the dealers: With mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width one should not fear the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, nevertheless it is advisable to use a mattress protector, which can be easily removed and washed.
Even though nowadays mattress covers are usually made with a full zip, so that after opening you get two halves (immensely important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially executed alone, often seems like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get out of it!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also so they should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (if already none are in it) and use mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine upholstery.
Polyurethane ， mattresses do not belong on such a pad.
Latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable for non-adjustable slats with 14 to 18 slats (slats) (possibly also combinations of latex and coconut), whereby slats with a larger number of slats, i.e. 28 or more slats, with lumbar support in the lumbar vertebral region and the possibility to regulate the slats hardness always pay off.
Adjustable slats do not include mattresses with spring skeleton, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring slats, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special attachment of the slats, which makes it possible to press the slats in or even bend them in such a way that they allow the shoulder of the sleeper to sink in at points.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area for "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are granted these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or grates with point elastic contact are designed.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the tension.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow for the right mattress and the right rust, most of the advantages are lost.
Again a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Therefore a 50 x 60 cm large cushion, as it likes for example the Scandinavians, appears ideal.
In the lateral position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate for the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (hay-filled) straw sacks.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
Also with mattresses the new magic word is called “bio ”.
Instead of crude oil raw materials, natural oils - castor oil and soybean oil, for example - are increasingly being used in the production of polyurethane foams.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
“In the case of mattresses, organic means that their core is made of materials of purely natural origin, ” explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
But natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scents when you sleep.
Here, too, a distinction is made between man and woman.
While men use a "cooling" plant extract of birch leaves so that the mattress cover can absorb heat and cool the body, women's covers have a "warming" effect.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets pleasantly warm when sleeping.
And today ’ s favourites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercially available polyurethane and also much more flexible).
By combining the different stiffness of cold foam and Visco foam, more zones are created that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
For a high quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to berappen.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to reduced VAT, as they are considered medical devices.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
One sees, to save at the mattress and at the rust is not so easy.
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers, who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with Visco quilted foam memory for CZK 11,990.
The second one is free of charge.
It was Tempur material that ushered in the era of viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and high density at an almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, since they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launches.
Tempur becomes soft with warmth, in a cool environment it solidifies again.
It adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burns, but also generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are not only used for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want people to have surveillance equipment to keep the kids under control
Fear for their own children is growing, and more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system that was originally invented to search for cars is just as capable of locating people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as recently with the disappearance without a trace of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette pack, but soon it will be no bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have been frightened by the case of the disappeared Anička, and they are looking for ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the GPS suppliers on the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases there may be misuse of such equipment, for example if you put it in someone's pocket without them knowing about it, but we have not had such a case before."
“Most customers actually buy it for security reasons, ” adds Pilin.
In his opinion, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out, however, that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, he or she simply gets rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they do not want to be controlled."
“The mobile phones aroused great expectations among parents at the beginning, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices, ” says Bočková.
They also argue whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it's the mobile phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also look for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She admits, however, that similar devices can be helpful in a sudden attack by a paedophile.
According to Roberta Čech from RC Monitoring, which provides locating services for both automobiles and persons, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, there is even a built-in inclinometer, which means that if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also be provided by intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one only has to install special software.
The problem with current tracking devices is that they are either matchbox-sized devices that resemble trailers, or smaller cell phones.
There is always a risk that you will lose them.
According to Mr Pilin of the Macro Weil, we are therefore currently testing equipment that looks like a normal digital watch.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all that it concerns a monitoring and / or a locating device.
"Or he realizes it only after a certain time, which gives the police a lead in time," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - to wristbands or trailers, always the same technology is used, as with the vehicle location.
In other words, the combination of the GPS ’ s locating function (just like the navigation system in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many fuses that you could wrap the whole Czech Republic you keep but only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of fuses, to be detonated with explosive devices.
The previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of fuse to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have set the course for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the fuses - two, but no more than four years.
The army bought the fuses from the joint-stock company STV Group, a.s. for a paltry 40 million crowns.
In its justification for purchasing this enormous amount of fuse, General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would use about 60 kilometers of fuse annually.
According to research by army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES referred to, this information indicates that the entire army must undergo extremely intensive pyrotechnical training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command to the secretaries and cleaners.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of fuses be reasonably justified.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these armies would last for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that two metres of fuse are completely sufficient for the training of every new professional soldier, then the army has created a reassuring supply for the aforementioned 225 years through these new purchases - also in view of the increased demand of the pioneer and special units.
In this connection, soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade recently complained to Defence Minister Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for small arms, so that shooting exercises are severely restricted because of the lack of funds.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't understand why they buy so many fuses from us."
But that is ultimately their decision, they will know what they need it for. "
"For us, the army is a good customer that we, as traders, want to meet as closely as possible," says Jan Děcký, Sales Manager of the STV Group.
Jan Pejšek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of fuse with the argument that the army had covered itself with these "ammunition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký from the STV Group, however, only speaks of a four-year service life of fuses and police and army pyrotechnicians of only two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible," one of them admits, but who wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused of criticizing the army as a soldier.
At the end of its useful life, all ammunition must be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
These tests are not for nothing, however, but cost more money.
A further argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity rebate for the 445 kilometre fuse.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," says spokesman Pejšek, explaining the position of buyers from the Ministry of Defence.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of fuses by pyrotechnicians of the police, who liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet brother army, has barely exceeded 1,500 metres for several years.
And the police only ever order such quantities of these ammunition, which they can consume before the end of their useful life.
Already because of the security of the pyrotechnicians, besides, one keeps the possibility open to flexible purchases of modern and thus also reliable fuses.
The Ministry of Defence already has huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand member Czechoslovak People ’ s Army was preparing for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians who spoke to MF DNES, the Czech armed forces will face the same problem in a few years with the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old fuses that they have bought so "cheaply" today.
To this day I like the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition
The winning position in the competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
Last year ’ s winner of the competition “Small Entrepreneur of the Year ” was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of its success seems like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realise that Liberec lacks good accommodation at reasonable prices.
From the savings from his vacations abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Given that he was a sixth-semester college student, this was certainly a bold undertaking.
"The price, quality ratio annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all his profits in the house, which he then converted step by step into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then he has managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels in Liberec with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in just seven years of business activity.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé to which we have sold our franchise, and other interested parties in the Pytloun franchise have already signed up," says entrepreneur number one from last year.
"A big part of this license sale for the operation of hotels has just won the competition" Entrepreneur of the Year ", Mr. Pytloun adds approvingly.
The victory brought him greater popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, they often congratulated me afterwards and I must say that it was really good," he remembers.
I really recommend everyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
There is no need to win immediately, every visualization is good.
He says that to this day he benefits from contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have happened at all.
"I still maintain regular business relations with some of the people I have met thanks to the competition."
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success is also reflected a little on each of his employees.
And since he has about seventy.
"I notice in them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is generally recognized."
I really do not see this as just a personal success, no, it is the result of the good work of all of us. "
"My name has only come to the fore a little bit," Lukáš Pytloun says modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The first prize in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition last year went to Karel Žďárský, owner of Farmet.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts with which he had stamped out of the small tool shop in Česká Skalice a company that makes hundreds of millions of turnovers.
"I can say that this acknowledgement not only encouraged me but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition", says the winner of last year.
At the beginning of Farmet ’ s history there was an effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Žďárský a small workshop for lease as compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate long, let his career run wild in the company in which he had been employed until then and founded his own company for the production of plastic tubs with a few of his father ’ s comrades.
A short time later they began to concentrate on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in the whole of Central Europe.
But it is only through the success of the aforementioned competition and its mediation that it has entered the consciousness of the non-experts.
"Not only do our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, but our foreign partners have also begun to attach greater value to a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
However, the past year at Farmet was not only marked by euphoria.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of toolmaking products.
The crisis, which at the time shook not so much the citizens, but above all companies, was just reaching its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course we could not escape this situation."
"Turnover decreased by 40 percent, we had to cut production and even resort to layoffs," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
But they managed to get a grip on the situation and keep the company in the black, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one of them, the company was unwilling to cut back on investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, strengthened our presentation at international fairs and won top prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in winning - but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
An opinion poll that cleans up nonsensical regulations
The "Absurdity of the Year" opinion poll is part of the business competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already been eliminated.
The dubious winner of the next edition of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" was the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
Thus more than a third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
The Social Security Administration demanded a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it with two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the Commercial Register when inspecting social security payers," said Jana Buraňová, spokeswoman for ČSSZ.
The purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all regulations and directives that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to abolish the nonsensical ones.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the German Business Newspaper (HN), which is enjoying growing popularity among the public.
Last year, when almost three thousand people took part in the vote, the figure was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to impede business.
"For example, as far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, we rank first in the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurial activity has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, which is eight places lower than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was declared for the first time in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the deadline for the competition at the end of September.
To register, the website www.firmaroku.cz. The organiser of the competition then selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and allows the public to vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred, or to be more precise, 105 pointless rules and regulations have already been registered for this year's opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the shortlisted "finalists" of the competition, for example, there are provisions that motorway and expressway maintenance vehicles have to pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to pay tolls every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the competition on Wenceslas Square in Prague at the beginning of November is part of a happening in which political and public personalities regularly take part.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Businessmen of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic took part in the competition ’ s climax.
"Where the state throws clubs between the legs of the entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic upswing, therefore it is my goal to abolish each year at least thirty paragraphs, which make today's entrepreneurs still unnecessarily difficult their enterprises", informed Martin Kocourek, the Minister for industry and trade.
Efforts to eliminate nonsensical arrangements are having an impact.
In 2007, people were most disturbed by the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to notify the commercial office at the location of their permanent premises three days in advance of their intention to visit an exhibition or fair with an exhibition stand.
This obligation was cancelled by an amendment to the Trade Act.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the Employment Office business trips of employees in the range of up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
The regulation was chosen as the absurdity of the year 2009, which required physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the consulting room.
This regulation was moderated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator obligation was dropped.
A new category honours socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the business newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair undertakings.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the impact of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, Regional Manager of Vodafone, which is the exclamator and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebel of the Year" competition.
This year ’ s first year of this special subcategory of the main Vodafone Company of the Year competition was open to companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is highly inspirational and would provide enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in the subject matter of their activities, their efforts have a common denominator - support and consideration.
Here it concerns for example around gehandicapte humans, there around personal problems or the health of the own coworkers.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the formation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit ž Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for handicapped children for seventeen years.
A paper mill from Poděbrady also takes exemplary care of its handicapped employees, who make up 70% of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title of "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region"; in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition it took third place in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the winner was the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which introduced, among other things, a fluent working time that was reduced to an average of 35 hours per week without a proportionate reduction in wages.
At the award ceremony, the jury also acknowledged the fact that the company mainly purchases from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens ’ initiatives in its vicinity and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We try to recycle as much as possible in order to minimize the impact of our business and administration on the environment", explains its managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem Region, in turn, cares about the health of its employees and has therefore purchased ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, furthermore it promotes homework for its employees and uses cartering services provided by a domestic sheltered workshop for corporate events.
"In addition, we support the" People in Need "foundation, which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
It is also worth mentioning the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to the pension insurance of its employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We provide our employees with contributions for catering, for work, for raising their qualifications and for holidays," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian Silesian Region.
In the Responsible Company of the Year category, all the district finalists in the Vodafon Company of the Year competition were automatically registered. They answered the questions in the questionnaire enclosed with the registration and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest.
Wrong or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the" Responsible Company of the Year "competition, but in the main Vodafone Company of the Year competition they were not disqualified."
“It is not possible to register separately only for this competition, as it is only a sub-category of the main company of the year competition, ” explains Karel Goldman from the organising agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsen Land Fund - Police arrests in public tender
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police made arrests in recent days.
The local media, entrepreneur and real estate agent Luboš G. was led away by the detectives in handcuffs.
This had allegedly tried to manipulate a just taking place public competition for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the properties offered in the competition fell to a concrete prospective customer.
The latter is said to have paid Luboš G. half a million.
"At this time, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the offence of fraudulent dealings in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsen Public Prosecutor's Office of the newspaper "Právo". She could not provide further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was fired by the police.
In view of the scant official information, one can only speculate about the way in which he could manipulate the public competition.
Spokesperson of the Land Fund Lubomír Černá pointed out in response to Právo ’ s question that the police actually made arrests in the Pilsen branch of the Land Fund during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not at all about one of our employees," she specified.
According to Ms Černá, the public competition was correctly named "Invitation to tender for the transfer of land claims under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the offered land.
"In the context of the request, such persons shall offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared value of the property."
"According to the claims offered, the sequence of potential buyers is determined, and then the land fund transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," explains the fund's spokesperson.
Luboš G. obviously had information at his disposal as to who had registered at the request and as he himself was a rightful person, having bought himself a number of restitution claims, he offered to a property interest that he withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat compensation.
That would also be a sufficient explanation of why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had already too good contacts with the Pilsen Land Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the cause of the former head of the Land Fund, Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for publishing plots of land in substitute restitutions for which location decisions on construction projects had already been made.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. also acquired land from the Land Fund that was intended for the construction of public roads, to be more precise, at the site where the construction of the access highway to the Borské pole industrial estate was planned.
Later, he exchanged them very favorably with the magistrate for a house right in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
At that time, the town hall had to give in with a heavy heart in order not to endanger the building project by blocking the properties.
Household housing costs are rising by several hundred per month
As of January, households will not only have to reckon with higher costs for all types of energy, but also with higher water and wastewater charges, and for district heating, with rents rising in some places.
Families will have to withdraw several hundred kroner per month from their wallets from January onwards.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas up to 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places also increase the price of district heating supplies.
The cost of electricity alone costs the households several hundred kroner more per year.
The heavy electricity prices were lowered by all main suppliers, thus the debt is the clear promotion of current production from renewable sources, particularly from photovoltaic plants.
Gas is only moderately expensive, but this is exactly when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Also here you can expect a few hundred kroner more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Especially larger towns are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kronor more per month for district heating, and families in Liberec will have to pay more than 1000 kronor more per year.
The inhabitants of Prague, on the other hand, face 9 percent higher water and sewage charges in case the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains among the lowest in the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rent price increases are to be expected for example in 140,000 rented apartments, with which starting from January the so-called rent regulation is omitted.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, is planning to increase rents by one hundred percent from January.
The company wants to take legal action against those who do not agree with this increase in tenants.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in approximately 300,000 apartments today, are likely to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children getting drunk on Fernet and rum beer is out - it just looks too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once also a good whisky, which one stole from the house bar from the father.
These are the drinks after which drunken Czech teenagers under the age of fifteen are the most frequently treated in an emergency.
No exception are children, who must sleep their hangover repeatedly in the hospital.
This emerges from the experiences of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of child departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is definitely hard alcohol", said Právo Luděk Pelikán, head physician of the paediatric department in the Central Bohemian Clinic Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it succeeds to take a bottle from the house bar from the father, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it does not smell so strong," explains the head doctor.
The spokesperson of the Motol Faculty Hospital, Eva Jurinová, agrees.
"It's mostly about fernet or rum."
"This is the current alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"Sometimes it was also about slivovitz, which you take away from home", said Mrs. Jurinová.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drinkers are no exception to hospitalization.
In front of the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working since that year, he worked for ten years in the paediatrics department of the Motol hospital, where ambulance cars delivered drunk students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was admitted for the first time with 3.5 per mille alcohol in her blood and in combination with" ecstasy "," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was in the exhibition area in Holesovice at some dance party."
“The interesting thing was that it didn ’ t seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn ’ t come home for 48 hours, ” the chief physician wondered.
It is precisely the lack of interest on the part of parents, or their incredible tolerance in toasting with their own offspring, that is considered one of the main causes of children's growing alcoholism.
According to experts, children are not really dependent in the true sense of the word.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic addiction to alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who drink alcohol repeatedly, a negative family background is usually characteristic, "explains Chief Physician Pelikán.
According to the spokesperson of the Motol hospital, Mrs Jurinová, by mid-November about forty drunken children had been admitted to the local paediatric and adolescent medicine department.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning that made hospitalization necessary are included in the statistics.
Drunken children brought home after outpatient treatment by their parents or, if necessary, by the police, will not be registered.
Apart from the cases, in which children drink only times so a bottle liquor in the school desk there are according to Mr. Pelikán three seasonal amplitudes, on which one can rely 100%: Walpurgis night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either sorrow for the poor testimony or joy of the holidays."
"On Walpurgis Night, I also saw seven drunken children in the picture at once," says Dr. Pelikán.
Paradoxically, a drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who only has to deal with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The following morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, can be dispelled in the hospital by a fluid infusion with glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks.
"They are clearly better off, because after the" wonderful "experience in the evening, they wake up with a good mood, without anything hurting anywhere."
"They're just a bit confused about where they are," Dr. Pelikán admits, sometimes upsetting the patients at least by listing the cost of the treatment.
Because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"Every now and then I have used this as a means of education, when I have directly calculated to the children during the visit, what their drunkenness has cost and that it may well happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such party," Dr. Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse proceedings to claim the costs necessary to cure the drunken children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L 159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light fighter planes, L ’ 159 out of a total of five, exchanged by the Czech Ministry of Defence for the transport aircraft Casa C ’ 295M, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa – EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type are in the possession of a foreign army.
So far, they have only been seen at manoeuvres or air shows abroad.
This is the airworthy two-seater version of the "L" 159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seated L ’ 159.
These are currently still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took it over last week.
Jan Pejšek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, says that it is not yet known when the aircraft will be physically dispatched from Vodochody.
The single-seat fighter plane L ’ 159, in turn, was removed from long-term warehouses without further contributions and investments from the ministry ’ s portfolio.
“The double-seated L ’ 159T1 was replaced in its current condition and appearance, ” Pejšek told Právo.
He added that the army would not have to do without two-seater fighter planes, since the Ministry of Defense signed a 200 million euro contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 for the conversion of four superfluous L 159 into a two-seater version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second one it intends to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has undertaken to enforce the warplanes to equip one of NATO ’ s countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the purchaser of the L 159 aircraft and that these aircraft will be used to train NATO pilots.
"It is therefore up to the customer how he implements the matter," Pejšek said.
The business paper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L 159.
The bartering of five litres in exchange for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence did not call for tenders, but approached EADS directly.
The then Defense Agency argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L 159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 Aero aircraft, of which they only used 24, the rest they wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the planes Casa might also have a judicial aftermath.
The European Commission took the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice. The reason? It should have selected the aircraft on the basis of a European tender and certainly not by appealing to a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last is expected to land within fourteen days at the airport Kbely.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously less at risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is supposed to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," said co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should definitely undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors are present, such as family health problems, Ms Eeles added.
In 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the study participants, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
These men had the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
For men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, however, this risk decreased by 33 percent, for men up to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which form already at the prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone is equivalent to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that he knew this study for a while, but that the relationship between finger length and cancer risk had not yet been "fully established".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks there is mostly stuck snow, in many places the winter servants were on the road all night long.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed for several accidents involving lorries and cars and the D1 near Brno is also "standing" in the direction of Prague.
This is what Novinky.CZ told the dispatcher of the Central Automobile - Moto - Clubs (ÚAMK).
At kilometre 91, one lorry crashed, at kilometre 93, two lorries crashed into each other and this accident resulted in injuries.
There are also a few cars in the ditch.
There are also problems at 185 km of the D1 motorway heading towards Prague.
Here, too, two trucks collided.
The riders should leave just behind Brno at km 190 or drive through Brno and drive up to Kývalka at km 182.
There are kilometres of traffic jams.
An accident also happened on the D11 and this right at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a snow cover several centimetres thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns form in the Prosek district, and the Štěrboholská Street is also completely congested.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams are running late, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
The Prague crisis unit meets at eight in the morning.
There are also problems with the railways and the airport.
The Czech Railways had to cancel seven express trains due to snow drifts.
There are problems, for example, on the Prague-Kralupy or Prague-Beroun route.
Travellers should be aware of the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport is closed from 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are passable only with increased caution.
Around Vyškov, three secondary roads are completely impassable, snow drifts occur in places in the surroundings of Brno, and in the surroundings of Blansko, snow blowers are forced to be used on some high-altitude roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three roads completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, snowblowers will have to be used to clear the snow.
It is not yet possible to estimate when they will be accessible again.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
According to ČTK, there is a snow cover up to five centimetres thick on the roads, which for nature conservation reasons can only be spread with inert spreading agents.
In the Czech Republic fresh snow fell from two to ten centimetres, most of it in northern Bohemia - in places up to 18 centimetres.
Up to 15 centimetres of fresh snow fell in the Moravian and Silesian region.
But in the Czech Republic it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon".
For the first time, American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, which is currently known only by its code name XM, 25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super accurate cannon.
Their projectiles are guided to the target by laser with an accuracy of only a few metres.
The special projectiles of calibre 25 mm, which were developed for this rifle and contain highly explosive explosives, function practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only on impact with the target, but at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
That is, it can be used against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or a trench.
Usually it is not protected from above, so the murderous splintering of steel from above can easily put it out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to make use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically proceeds like this: he aims at the target and emits a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact point of sight after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he only has to print off.
"Let's say you measured 543 m."
"When you push, the weapon charges and shoots at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu Group is relocating its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specialising in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 men and women will move their workplace from the previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman of Fujitsu explained, medium-term there should be accommodated still another 100 jobs of the company, which are distributed so far to the region.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, in addition the open-plan offices in the Astro park would accommodate the function of the coworkers better.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu was merely a tenant.
The managing director in charge, Bernd Wagner, said, "with Frankfurt, Niederrad, we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The Frankfurt Head of Economic Affairs, Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a "global player" had been won.
That was a "great declaration of location".
Fujitsu fits to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Lord Mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (The Greens), regretted Fujitsu ’ s decision.
The city was informed of the intention early by the management.
"We have, of course, offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
The friendly contacts, however, could not have changed anything in the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been the deciding factor.
It is now a question of preventing a long vacancy at such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative."
The house on the Rathausplatz used by Fujitsu to date and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" (small vertical), together with the other buildings on Marienbader Platz, were among the most controversial building projects in the spa town ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city district was created between the railway station and the city hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive development of the areas previously used as parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consultancy and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still linked to Siemens at the time, moved into the company.
The property used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by Frankfurt ’ s German Real Estate, the Deutsche Immobilien, in conjunction with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold one year later to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Konuzern, based in Tokyo, calls itself the third-largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies with computers and servers, for example, and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine, Main, area is one of the largest in Germany, but far more employees are Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving to Frankfurt, while the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
7000 square metres were rented for this purpose in the Astro Park office building.
The twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped layout - is home to the Central Association of the Electrical and Electronics Industry.
Amazon locks servers - Threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in distress.
The Internet ’ s service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Political pressure may lie behind the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
WikiLeaks Founder Assange allegedly resides in England.
The Wikileaks exposure platform is coming under increasing fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol ’ s wanted list, is said to be in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks ousted from Amazon ’ s server."
"Free speech in the country of the free", the revelations activists announced via Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before that, the Internet ’ s Amazon company had banished the Wikileaks dorfer documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish the secret diplomatic cables in order to cope with the high number of access to the documents.
Speaking on Twitter, Wikileaks said: "Great - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman investigated, the television station CNN reported, citing the Lieberman office.
The chairman of the Senate committee on homeland security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British Guardian.
"I would have liked Amazon to have taken this action earlier in the light of previous Wikileaks classification releases," the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be banned from use as servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and ruthless behaviour is jeopardising our national security and endangering lives around the globe," says a statement by the non-partisan senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to spread stolen material."
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the authorities in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol ’ s wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper "The Independent" the 39-year-old Australian is in Great Britain, the exact location is known Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always characterized the investigation in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls for an assassination of Julian Assange."
This is why Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the Wikileaks ’ founders will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, Mike Huckabee, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, had demanded that the person in charge of the Wikileaks be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on television - obviously ironically - that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Meanwhile, an exchange of blows erupted between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently revealed espionage of diplomats.
"I'm not sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The US government is now extensively reviewing the protection of its databases.
According to the White House, the Vice Director of the Center for Anti-Terror Measures, Russell Travers, has been appointed as Special Representative.
Travers was responsible for developing the "necessary structural reforms" that had become necessary following the disclosure of the embassy reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The American government also announced that it would ensure the safety of dissidents and activists if the Wikileaks publication put them at risk.
"We have made every effort to engage with them," said Foreign Affairs Spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We stand ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream pastries are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice actually come from?
From Gelatiere and Gelataio.
The jelly, in German a little ancient the ice-cream confectioner, makes cream by all rules of the Italian ice-cream art.
The gelataio uses a spatula to remove the ice cream from the refrigerated counter, paint it into the waffle and then sell it.
To know this, one does not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know even more about ice, you can't miss the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
Ice University was set up in 2003 by the manufacturer of ice machines in order to ensure that the ice cream from his machines lived up to the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlour.
Some dream of a new career in Midlife, others simply dare to go on the slippery ice of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves slow food and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants after years in a nerve-racking job something own eintüten.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
The decisive factor is not only good taste, but also the silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano doesn't forget the icing on the cake of the national and Mediterranean superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there's plenty of romance."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixer that is heated to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a cock on the machine and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all milk ice varieties.
The lecturer is immediately confronted with questions: Can ice cream be produced only with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you give free rein to your desire to experiment?
Luciano warns against being misled by the zeitgeist.
Those who speak of ice cream "made only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilisers - usually a natural product, such as guar gum from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabiliser, but it has to be sold within one day, otherwise it will sink and the customer will bite on nothing but ice grains.
Certain variations on the base mass are permitted.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
For the flavor in the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients purchased in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to feed you dozens of flavoured additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or the ice cream made from the white base, which turns into a yellow cream with eggs and becomes the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations with cocoa powder.
Now the course participants are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano has them produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additives.
Fruit ice varieties are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavourings, more fruit, puree - taste is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ， ice cream does not necessarily taste nuttier if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ’ s are produced by the working group, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced blend really brings out the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice production is a mathematical task: If peach is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra portion of sugar is required for lemon ice.
Luciano pulls out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winegrowers use it to measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate computing.
Making ice does not require as much physical effort as before.
Not only the device for the automatic production of the base mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice cream mix is simultaneously beaten creamy and cooled to sub-zero temperatures.
Despite all automation, small breakdowns do not fail.
The Brazilian Gustavo covers himself and his colleagues with fruit puree from top to bottom when the oversized hand blender gets out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Checkers in the Twilight
The European food authority Efsa was infiltrated by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
This accusation is now being made by the Testbiotech expert group, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we ’ ve documented it well, ” said Testbiotech ’ s chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa ’ s expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa ’ s expert group have also been under contract with the Ilsi lobbyists ’ association for years.
It is paid by companies like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has significantly worked on Efsa ’ s genetic testing regulations and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticised Then.
The Efsa ’ s regulations are paragraph wise identical with position papers of the Ilsi and thus bear the handwriting of the industry, which is supposed to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech criticizes an interest collision.
Thus a high-ranking Efsa is a manager recently without conditions or transition period to the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta - and have thus changed sides.
Recently, Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personnel links between the controlling EU authorities and industry lobbyists, which made the Federal Environment Agency and EU parliamentarians attentive.
However, Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
A statement states that all serious data is to be used, including those from industry, as long as they are of a high professional quality.
The experts who work for Efsa are not required to have no contacts with the industry.
But they would have to disclose it.
Kuiper grants his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
Independent experts, such as Then, criticise the fact that genetically modified plants are currently permitted in animals without any feedingstuffs and that the reaction of genetic plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize does in the field, ” says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins but not the entire gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
“If you don ’ t look for the risks, how can you find them? ” Then asks accusing.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The scientist has been conducting research in genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
In this area, as in the USA, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers left who are not intertwined with corporations.
As a rule, critical studies for companies would not be published.
"Industry controls security research," claims Hilbeck.
The Trace of Stones
Uli Gsell also got some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of the Stuttgart train station, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: In September the excavators had arrived and had begun to demolish a large part of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion dollar lowering of the station.
When construction came to a halt, most of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has secured himself some of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He raves: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
What he will do with the rocks, he does not know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen established his stone empire.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all those that fell victim to the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were to be ground into gravel or disappear into the landfill, ” he says in his office, a wooden bunk that was once a guard house.
He is said to have been insulted and threatened when it was written in the newspapers in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he has talked to the S ’ 21 opponents, for days.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything for the demolition.
And if it happens, it is the most sensible thing to use the stones again.
About 200 S "21" opponents then took one of the average of 80 kilos heavy cuboids with them, Unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but also some in the hope of being able to give it back when it is rebuilt.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 large trucks.
About half of them are still stored in the forest, the rest has long since been sold.
Garden owner, landscaper, house builder.
They had come from everywhere and carried away what the trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of offense have long since turned into "Mäuerle" or into boundaries of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
“Wouldn ’ t be the political component. ”
He climbs into his off-road vehicle and makes a tour through his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and abandoned it, later biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone merchant.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40000 tons of bricks.
He gathered his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he is the biggest stone-dealer of the republic.
It slows down.
There are artistically carved sandstones in the snow.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke", he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, he swarms.
"My favorite stone."
We walk up the path through the forest.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And so on.
"Beautiful travertine."
Once the cuboids belonged to the tribune of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the cathedral Sankt Blasien, tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what toil, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were cut by hand and moved with simple pulleys and ox-carts, he becomes very reverent.
"It would be a scandal if you were to shred something like that."
He did not become rich, certainly not rich.
But 14 people employ the stone merchant today, besides, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the leftover recycler.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There, too, there are stones to save.
High-Potential Talent Struggle
There is a lively rush at the buffet.
16 students crowd around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and Volkswagen have invited the students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition, they will talk shop with VW developers about the car of the future - and get to know Volkswagen at the same time.
In the competition for the brightest minds, many companies now go into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates in the lecture halls as early as possible before they enter the labor market and are courted by others.
And because the universities do not publish lists of their students ’ achievements, they try to spot and retain the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Braunschweig, the automobile company is promoting the talents.
A young lady from the Human Resources department distributes ballpoint pens, gummy bears and folders with the Volkswagen logo.
She tells the promising young talents about internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the company.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig supervises the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can at the same time get to know students, look at interesting candidates and think about who would be considered as an employee."
Such collaborations, according to Selle, are not unusual.
What is new is that the students are being so offensively charged.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The battle for the freshly graduated students will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer select their employees from a large pool of applicants.
Instead, they must boast about themselves and, in particular, courting for highly qualified workers.
Especially graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
Roman Dykta goes on the hunt for talent for the auditing and consulting firm KPMG.
He organizes complex recruiting events such as the KPMG “Race ”, a kind of modern scavenger hunt, in which the participants have to find their way on the basis of GPS“ coordinates ”.
The company plans to send eight promising students across the USA next year.
Participants can also take a look at KPMG ’ s stores and get to know the company.
Who is allowed to participate, decides in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
According to Dykta, the guns get bigger and bigger when hitting and stabbing for high potentials at universities.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Just a simple sailing trip was not enough for us."
For talent hunter Dykta the plan seems to work.
"We still have contact with all participants of a similar campaign last year."
"Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct hunting on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies also go stalking very classically at professional fairs.
"We try to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"At Intersolar, for example," reports Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Manager at SolarWorld.
The company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of offspring.
There are currently 35 vacancies advertised on the company's website.
"It is very difficult to fill vacant positions at the moment."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to get in touch with one of the university ’ s professors.
SolarWorld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give hints that you can do internships with us or write your thesis."
Expensive promotions are not announced with the solar specialist.
For it the enterprise tries to recruit with other advantages for itself: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large corporation often cannot offer that," says HR manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the leading role in the search for jobs.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for advancement are further decisive factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, SolarWorld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute draws up an annual leaderboard of German employers.
In addition it asks coworkers how content they are with their work and their job surrounding field and looks at the basic conditions for the persons employed.
HR manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also have positive effects on job seekers.
"I think applicants are looking particularly for external reviews of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build up a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees," he says.
In industry jargon, internal employer branding means creating employer brands within your own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, they would automatically promote their employer to friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing with gangs," says Kriegler.
Obama Stops New Oil Drilling
Off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
The government in Washington has issued a ban on this - thus finally revoking its earlier plans.
New drilling off the Atlantic coast remains prohibited for the time being.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar announced this on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Before the disaster, which cost the lives of eleven workers and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The advocates want to reduce the dependence of the US on oil supplies from abroad.
Who bears the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not yet been finally clarified.
At the centre of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is confronted with billions in claims.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is to present its results in the course of December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the post-explosion freeze.
Subsequently, various oil companies submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which fell into disrepute after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing fundamental reform.
In parallel, Obama has announced that he will close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that stricter regulation would make production in the Gulf much smaller than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry", is the result of a recent industry survey by the consulting firm BDO - even before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also deplores the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new promotional projects would be postponed until further notice - to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland burnt down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a petrol station: billions of litres of spilt crude oil have destroyed nature in Ogoniland, Nigeria.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't put off," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You'll get enough oil sludge in front of your lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to photograph a boy wading up to his chest in the water with the streaks surrounding him: In the rainbow-colored water shine, the scene looks almost pretty.
It is not visible that brown clouds of crude oil are floating beneath the surface.
She used to collect buckets of prawns here, says Esther Badom, on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the sluggishly flowing water is completely dead.
Five years ago, huge quantities of crude oil poured out of a burst pipeline into the vast wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach fish-rich waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps crossed by rivers the whole extent of the devastation becomes obvious.
Instead of light water, the motor boat stirs up brown broth; whoever dips his hand into the water pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove saplings protrude from the ground like black liquorice sticks, sadly isolated palms let their fronds hang.
Swarms of birds, as they are otherwise common in wetlands, one searches in vain: As soon as the outboard is silent, spreads eerie peace in the former paradise smelling like a gas station.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari gloomy: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield that has been fought over for decades: here the first explorers from Europe invaded more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance organized in the 80s with the later executed writer Ken Saro "Wiwa", here the Shell "corporation had to cease production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is unable to return to Ogoniland. While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire Delta region, which is three times the size of Switzerland, with over 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oilfields in Ogoniland lie idle, the situation is too unstable for the company.
Every few hundred meters, steel frames protrude out of the water like bizarre sculptures: the heads of the boreholes are called "Christmas trees" far too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the marrow.
Again and again such a drilling head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres have been poured into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil that entered the waters off Alaska during the accident of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who is responsible for the persistent ecological meltdown, about it is disputed.
While Shell ’ s corporate corporate sabotage and organized oil theft account for more than 90% of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused Shell of setting substantially lower safety standards in Nigeria than is usual in the world: the rate of defects on the pipes alone was "many times higher than elsewhere".
At a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-smeared workshop under the open sky, figures appear from the mangroves: they are naked and smeared with oil up to their necks.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with pipes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the area, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
At first gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later kerosene trickles out at the end of the pipe and finally diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 litres a day: "That brings us 34,000 naira" - around 22 dollars.
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cooker can still undercut that with scarcely 40 euro cent per litre ridiculously low Diesel price: Because they get their raw material free of charge.
It comes from "bunkers", which tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: In this way, the country is lost daily at least 16 Million liters of crude oil, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta.
However, only a tiny fraction of the provisionally intermediate raw material is processed illegally: organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military personnel, fill the lion ’ s share in tankers and sell it off on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers purely academic the debate as to whether the environmental catastrophe is due more to the agitation of the population or to the lax mode of production.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and had not so thoroughly destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime the relationship of the Ogoni above all to Shell is however so destroyed that only a departure of the company would be applicable: “Perhaps other nationalities turn out as better. ”
Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you disappeared," says the muscular oilman.
"Soldiers can come every minute."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special force of the armed forces, they are not likely to be arrested, but face a painful bribe.
Also the soldiers coming mainly from the country's north - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has put our country on the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction faults in A380 engines
The A380 apparently has a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction fault while investigating an emergency landing machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Qantas, an emergency landing aircraft, apparently had much better luck than previously known: The Australian Air Safety Authority has detected a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 aircraft - and now warns of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: with an oil hose connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, according to an ATSB statement published this Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
This concerns engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas ’ Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the UK turbine manufacturer.
She filed a statement of claim with an Australian federal court in Sydney, allowing him further legal action against the company.
Qantas ’ head Alan Joyce said his airline would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine parts had loosened and damaged the wings.
Rolls-Royce identified an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced to carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a cooperation with Rolls-Royce, ATSB Spokesperson Martin Dolan said.
The security problem was considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas, the airline had its A380 fleet for weeks on the ground held.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
As a precaution, Lufthansa changed the engine of an A380.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany all in white: almost the whole country has fallen snow overnight.
On many roads there is chaos, trains and flights fail.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
The winter frosts Germany: With icy temperatures almost the whole republic is snowed in at night on the Thursday - which leads in many places to traffic chaos.
In the north and in the east there are 15 centimetres thick snow.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in continuous use, but could not cope with the constantly fresh snow.
In addition, heavy gusts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Bundesamt für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie (BSH) (Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency) expects the morning storm tides with water levels of 1.2 meters above the normal level on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig.
In Saxony, snow drifts on the motorways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
According to the Severe Weather Centre Meteomedia, the alert level in Saxon Switzerland was violet - the highest level ever.
Sometimes 30 centimetres of fresh snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused drifts.
Several trucks and cars got stuck there at night.
In Saxony, too, police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to the German Railways, there are considerable disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony the long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld an ICE to Munich had to stop its journey.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue workers with blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept over the streets.
At major German airports, snow winds lead to numerous flight cancellations.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the flight information, headquarters are already reported some cancellations.
According to a Fraport spokeswoman, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers are at the airport, there are still just under 400 cots ready for them.
Accidents had already occurred on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck ’ s driver was killed in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The engineer was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: here, too, a truck was detected at a level crossing because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the early morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died, after she had rolled over with her car near Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
But the meteorologists have good news: The snow will still be loose and powdery and will therefore whirl up even with slight gusts.
But the wind will diminish.
Only the Baltic Sea is affected by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to part with its landmark: according to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could raise up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters attractive: the twin towers in Frankfurt ’ s banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have been allowed back to their old jobs.
But now the financial group wants to get the costs out of the renovation - and looks for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes with reference to a speaker.
The speaker did not give reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then rent it back," he said.
Thus of Germany largest bank gives its company headquarters already after short time again.
The bank had taken over the double towers only in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euro of the investors of an internal fund and afterwards extensively reorganized.
According to the figures, the energy conversion consumed around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
According to industry experts, the value of the towers, now renamed "Greentowers", is estimated at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, said the spokesman.
Thousands mourn for dead companions
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand thought of the buried miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be recovered because the security situation in the accident shaft remains precarious.
Just under two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been lowered into the accident shaft, but had found no trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue workers were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no longer any chance of survival for the cronies.
The bodies could not yet be recovered.
Now relatives and friends commemorated the dead with a commemoration ceremony.
Ten thousand people had gathered in bright sunshine in Greymouth on the South Island of New Zealand.
They remained silent for two minutes.
In honour of the buried miners, 29 tables were set up on which helmets, lamps and the names of the miners could be seen.
Pictures and personal items, including clothes and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country the flags flew at half mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come "from the depths of the earth" to the surface again, said the Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key to the participants of the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit, said that he could not conclude the death of his son until he saw his body.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the ceremony.
During the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were buried.
Rescue workers began to put out a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, the glowing temperatures inside the mine begin to cool down, police chief Gary Knowles told journalists.
To hell, warrior!
Is Splatter suitable for art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the old genre anew with his fighter / epic poem "Walhalla Rising".
Which audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have been thinking of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking, warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents in rows with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, just because our hero likes to use brutal killing methods and his enemies already torn the bowels from the living body when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, doesn ’ t say a word about the whole film, and the other characters, too, let themselves be carried away to one or two sentences or a few agonizing death screams.
Otherwise, there will be silence and indulgence in the spooky, beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the scenery of the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cineastes with an interest in existentialism and very quiet tracking shots.
It ’ s nice if a film has several target groups, but only if they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug dealer ’ s trilogy Pusher, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humour or a little less brutality to the arthouse.
Most art cinema friends should be deterred by the splashing around brain mass and intestines.
The action, fans die at the latest before boredom, when Einauge for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries by ship to Jerusalem and an eternity stuck in calm and fog, before the team apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" did not find a cinema distributor in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
This is particularly sad because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-dripping façade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves a bit of attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a stringent plot, it is all about atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into a film.
And there is no escape from that for the viewer.
Refn hardly allows him a moment of relaxation and slowly closes his throat with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the unbelievable hatred that beats at him from the hearts of the characters. Translation: Marina Jenewein
Only a little blond boy, who stands by one eye faithfully, keeps something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporarily allies, possibly an ambassador of the devil himself.
It means ruin, but perhaps only to the depraved.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to annoy, excite and amaze.
An experience.
Enigmatic Earthworks
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to take a position on this - it still allows controls.
Around midnight, September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighters attack a mysterious cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is situated on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as behandlung Saur.
Her name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the rectangular block, hidden in a valley that runs out of electricity.
According to a briefing by the US foreign intelligence agency CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, which is also known under the name of the nearby town of El Jabbar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA presented a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
Using computer animation, it showed which components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a scaled down copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
She also presented photos showing the building up close or even the interior.
The reactor was close to commissioning, it was said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, hardly more is known than at that time, yes, the puzzles became rather bigger with the time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that, while the CIA was fairly certain before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in El Kibar, it saw little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence agencies in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of an "alleged reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation to be "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat replied succinctly in the summer that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions."
The Syrians hastily removed the rubble from the alleged "unused military building" and thoroughly planned the site.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium that had been produced by humans in El Khibar.
Furthermore, the IAEA received, via a Member State, satellite images of commercial operators from the period immediately following the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - has bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But, after analyzing the particles, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it, as it has about satellite imagery.
It also prevents inspectors from undertaking a second inspection at El Kıbar and access to the ruins of the bombed building.
But Israel, too, remains silent.
"We will never comment," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, since June 2008, the investigation of the case has been dragging on inconclusively and "is increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the Agency", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA apparently sees three further facilities, which are supposed to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and which, unlike the latter, still exist - as key to progress in the reconnaissance.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed which installations they are dealing with, nor what their function is or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as the Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and used satellite images to locate a building complex near Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or next to a military base - precisely for this reason, Syria is denying the IAEA access to the three sites.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent forward by the USA to spy on military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip of the U.S. intelligence agencies.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material has been moved back and forth between the three locations and the cuboid on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production."
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should later be separated from, these central questions are at best plausible assumptions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable traces were stored at the three sites.
As if the hundreds of lorry loads had disappeared from the ground, nobody wants information about where the rubble has gone.
The IAEA considers it unlikely that the Al Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometres from El Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, was tested by Syria in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste storage facility.
Former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley recently linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite imagery for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, images from orbit show that Syria was digging at the three suspicious locations and removing large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has done little to dispel the suspicion.
It is also said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months on developing a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - the effort alone shows how great the interest of the inspectors is.
However, Damascus also ironed out this proposal.
A year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna had appeased the idea that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter was not of great urgency. For example, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been bringing so-called special inspections into play for a few months, one of the strictest means available to the Vienna Nuclear Safety Agency to enforce inspections.
IAEA ’ s chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of “an option for which I will be open in the future, ” but he is still hesitating.
There is a high risk in this path: on the one hand, it requires a majority on the IAEA Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented there are far from eager to escalate.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: "What if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in times of war
Ever since Angelina Jolie began working on her nameless directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but that alone is enough for restlessness.
There is a persistent rumour that the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, after which some of the shooting days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there is still protest in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the Organisation of Women Victims of War wrote to Jolie about the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR and called for a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself ambassador of the UN Refugee Agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie ’ s attitude to the victims betrayed her enough through the script.
Her organization has recommended, according to the UN Refugee Agency, that Jolie be dismissed as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given permission to read her screenplay, has given Sarajevo permission after some back and forth - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author herself asserts that she has no political intentions with her film, has worked her way into the Yugoslavia conflict with much effort, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give all sides involved a voice.
However, the content remains vague.
A second synopsis on the film is circulating on the Internet, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the outbreak of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim woman, is abducted to a Serb camp, where he works as a guard.
Which sounds considerably different from the variant "rape victims crush themselves in torturer".
It is certain that Jolie ’ s film actually begins before the war.
The pressure on them, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation. ”
Now only Hollywood hackers can bring her peace: by illegally putting the script on the net, as they have done so many times before.
Nothing Like Away Here
On this evening it runs finally again really round for the Irish.
No trace of sadness.
The home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans howl with joy and loud music, stamping their feet.
In Cork, South Ireland, the Bailey ’ s Pub is shaking because players throw ping-pong balls into beer mugs over a three-meter distance – and hit them.
"Beer Pong" is the name of the bizarre spectacle, to win there will be 500 Euro victory bonus plus airline tickets to Las Vegas for the Beer Pong tieren World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself, distract from the probing question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not gambling fun in Las Vegas, he will have job interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a queasy feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still have no work there."
At least: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had jerk, in a flash her dream job as event manager, perhaps a good sign", says the young man and smiles.
Because of poor perspectives at home, two of Tanner ’ s three siblings have already sought their fortune abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys leave: It looks like with the Tanner's on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish are likely to leave the country in the near future, experts from the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
They even expect 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are true, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to the one Ireland suffered from in the 1980s.
After a decade of prosperity that brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is spreading once again.
The economic crisis is particularly unsettling for the young, well-educated Irish, who have hitherto only had an uphill climb.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times, there are plenty of letters to the editor from young emigrants complaining: 'Everything is going down the drain in Ireland'.
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one, please, turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, President of Ireland ’ s Student Union, sees a bleak future ahead, because the government is just window-dressing and has no future for young people.
“They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy on how to create new jobs, ” says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her fellow students move from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her main concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers an all-round service on the subject of working abroad.
"For young professionals, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website show photos surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year what it feels like to build something elsewhere.
Because there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction site in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are raising a fashion house.
In January it goes to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely sees his homeland, because he does extra shifts in order to be able to pay off the loan for his house at home.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says as he crosses the threshold of his house for the first time in a long time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am virtually never again."
He laughs a bit embarrassed and walks through cooled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the driveways park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros four years ago - 100 percent financed by credit.
"They were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid that it could go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I have no children to feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start all over again."
The civil engineer does not like the wailing he often hears at the moment.
"Nobody has to go hungry - our situation is not nearly as dramatic as it used to be here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe that's what makes us feel Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father, who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just look how it goes with life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London, he has already behind him and why it should not go well in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend?
There is one thing, however, that is of great concern to him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could degenerate into a farewell party.
"Just not too much emotion," he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
"Farewell, that sounds scary."
"Let's rather call it a leaving party, relaxed, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is getting stronger, as is support for private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil ’ s influence is greater than that of the United States.
These are the findings of the Latinobarómetro, a survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out on a regular basis since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly striking in this year's survey in September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has grown strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing at an annual rate of about 6% since 2002, the number of democracy advocates has risen from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Such a trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has been recovering since last year ’ s sharp slump.
But only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region ’ s most populous countries, are staunch democrats, lowering the regional average (see chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Chart 3).
Approximately 34% trust their country ’ s Congress and 45% their government. Both figures correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America ’ s economic crises undermined efforts to promote democracy.
This may have continued during the Great Depression, owing to Latin America ’ s short-lived recession and rapid recovery.
In addition, the poor were supported by a stronger social safety net.
(According to reports from this week ’ s UN Economic Commission for Latin America, Latin America ’ s poverty rate rose only marginally in 2009, and fell again this year by 32%.)
But from country to country there are strong differences in mood (see chart 4).
Brazil ’ s strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
This is less the case in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crime has increased.
Only for the second time since the beginning of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country as a greater problem than unemployment (see chart 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were the victims of a crime last year, but down from 38% last year, the figures are the lowest since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economy: about 71% of the interviewees stated supraregionally that the private sector is indispensable for development, in 2007 it was 56% (see chart 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% favor a private sector), even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil is the most important country in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, up from 11% last year).
By contrast, respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America see the US as the most influential country, with Venezuela playing this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Eine Wahlschlappe
Nobody expected the elections in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the election workers who rushed to help the beleaguered country.
Crowded ballot boxes, multiple ballots, ballot papers in the gutter, demolished polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problem.
Votehouses opened hours late.
Many Haitians, many of whom lost their homes in the January earthquake, wandered around in search of a choice.
Some eventually gave up altogether.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded that the election results be annulled on the basis of alleged fraud.
Throughout the country there have been partly violent protests.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "quite good in many respects."
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate, Jew Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected run-off is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial appeal.
If Jude declares Célestin, who has little or no support among the electorate, to be the winner of the runoff, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by a lack of organisation.
Shortly before the start of the election, approx. 250,000 ID cards, which are required for the election, were not yet distributed.
The stakes are high.
The donor countries regard a legitimate and recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves agree.
Secretly in the Middle
In the weeks following your husband ’ s sudden death, Argentina ’ s president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that boosted her popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%, the highest level since her election in 2007.
Whether she will be re-elected next year, however, depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor, and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are ambiguous.
Néstor Kirchner, who continued to guide economic policy after his wife ’ s election, often drew up budgets that did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra revenue at their own discretion.
On paper, last year the Fernández government lost a majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided, and Kirchner ’ s death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further divisions.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronists supported Cristina Fernández.
But, after chaotic sessions (with one parliamentarian slapping another ’ s face and others accusing the government of bribery), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget now applies to the next year, giving the President even more opportunity to spend money as she sees fit.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
Official inflation is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and trade unions' wage demands - drive the figure to nearly 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to be his main goals, not reducing inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census, which then beautified official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate approach?
It has called for talks between the private sector and trade union leaders.
And official evidence suggests that wage increases will be capped at 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy.
But inflation undermined the growth spurt with a large devaluation in 2002.
That is why Cristina Fernández may want to reconnect Argentina financially with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with holders of securities who had rejected the country ’ s earlier restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused a review by the IMF, as is customary elsewhere.
But, last month, Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the Fund will provide “technical assistance ” in establishing a new national consumer price index, which appears to be the first step toward cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active at the end of her term without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, most of which has had enough of Kirchnerism.
When Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that was brought to them will be abated.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether to quietly annul many of her husband ’ s political decisions.
Weak Applause for China
Taiwan ’ s voters are slowly moving closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the Strait?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of all eligible voters, cast their ballots to elect mayors and councillors in the five municipalities, according to a broad assessment by President Ma Ying.
By establishing groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the test, but only narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not obtain a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence for Taiwan, received nearly 50% of the vote, while the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party ’ s share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the KMT in the city council.
During the election, the usual events in Taiwan occurred, such as convoys of trucks with rioters, flags, waving mass processions, and sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election to a KMT presidential candidate,
when a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a bystander was killed.
Bizarre is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing ’ wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack affected the election and cast the DPP in a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates debated social housing plans and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China ’ s military threat.
As a result, the KMT does not like to prioritize its relations with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also avoided stoking the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
It is a response to the new awareness that Taiwan ’ s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, would like to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policies.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of luring Taiwan back into the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former Party leader Chen Shui ’ bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But, under Tai ’ s rule, a new generation of moderate politicians emerged, and the DPP is fighting for the votes of professionals and youth.
As a presidential candidate of the DPP, Tsai met with great approval, as did Su Tseng and Chen.
Your party is now doing everything it can to show that it, too, is capable of establishing close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires unbiased discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offers a "trustworthy alternative" to Ma's rash approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he said that the DPP candidates had done better to insist on Taiwan ’ s independence.
He even called on pragmatist Su to refrain from running for the presidency.
Even without Chen ’ s interference, the DPP has a hard time electing its possible candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Ma ’ s values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to campaign without him.
The main reasons for its unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-widening gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesperson, he will transform his cabinet and local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only partially in favour of rapprochement.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no turning back".
Grammy-level nominations: Surprisingly, jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was awarded the Newcomer of the Year award
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize Ceremony. Now, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been surprisingly nominated for this year ’ s Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated star on the jazz scene since her 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination seems a bit unusual, but it complies with the Grammy Rules, which allow an artist to have released a maximum of three albums before the release of the album that made him known to the general public.
Her ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her exhilarating voice and a good feel for pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can easily be compared to Norah Jones in 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz interpreter comes closest in this category to Spalding's nomination.
The album "Historicity" by the Vijay Iyer Trio was also nominated in the category of instrumental albums, making this favourite of the critics a huge success.
To Iyer's competitors belong among others "Moody 4B" by the experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by the keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rough-and-ready favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", has been awarded in the category of Contemporary Jazz, which usually includes albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the large group category, pitting him against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber, Jazz, and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life in Ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy-level nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical music categories
The classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awardcontain a colorful mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The list is headed by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his fourth symphony "Los Angeles", which was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The L.A. based composer Avner Dorman has also been nominated for his mandolin concert.
Nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
This year, five artists were nominated in the Classic Producers category - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical music albums are Bruckner's Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu" by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra in Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales were nominated.
As composers, Pärt has been nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt ’ s Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic Orchestra at Disney Hall on January 4, conducted by Esa ’ Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinenkonzert" received a nomination in the category instrumental solo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he had written the 15-minute piece especially for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I have used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for a recording of Stravinsky ’ s works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists were nominated the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc, André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, only women have been nominated as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
Soprano Jessye Norman was nominated in the classical crossover category for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula was approved unanimously by the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated, public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and congestion.
However, according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Baha'is, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, that makes me proud."
"It shows that justice reigns."
"There are few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"Wonderful people live in this valley."
The meeting began at 6: 00 p.m. and discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with voices on both sides being fairly evenly distributed, according to the press.
The debate continued on the newspaper ’ s website.
"There is no more America," was one comment.
"It is another planet of the monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty lies dead in the sand."
"America is at its end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the site of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for non-violence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. However, they wanted a larger and better place than the warehouse they rented together with a water filtration equipment manufacturer.
The new, approx. 2,300 m2 large mosque in the Mediterranean style should have two minarets and become about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approx. 17,500 m2 site on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council against the project.
Arsenic Resistant Microbe Could Enable New Life Forms on Earth or Elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacterial species that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, in their view it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"It requires either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it special, even though it's almost a 'strange' way of life," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online issue of Science on Thursday.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, as the scientists discovered, the bacterium continues to grow in Mono Lake, California, even when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"One wonders what else is possible," said the co-author of the report, Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference at which no details of the discovery were disclosed gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could deal with the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can use other elements to initiate biochemical processes and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the UK.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a first, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfé Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, which led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically identical, it assumed that microbes exposed to both could possibly replace one element with another.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently from phosphorus. It enters our biochemical system, where it virtually smears everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the GFAJ bacteria to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, the fact that it can survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but there has been no working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early earth years, she says, so science assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have developed differently than in the early geologic age," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe ’ s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other Stolen Show Dogs Found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen in front of a Bellflower ’ s motel were found, according to Thursday ’ s Los Angeles County Sheriff ’ s statement.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when unknown persons stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express "van" in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to the authorities.
Two of the dogs were spotted on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday night, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’ s Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are fine," says Whitmore.
"They are in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not specify the location of the dogs nor the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
“We don ’ t want to say more, ” Whitmore explains.
"We are following some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district animal home in Downey.
Representatives of the Sheriff found the van and the two dogs at different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unharmed according to the authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition this week, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek told The Times on Wednesday, the other dogs were supposed to participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC / Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the almost month-long tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their vans in front of their room windows.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany - to their motel room.
The fat Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window open a gap so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car as stolen on Tuesday at 6: 00 a.m.
Peek promised everyone who could give a hint to the Corgis a finder's reward. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday it was not certain whether a finder's wage will be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of MGM ’ s restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
A New York bankruptcy judge officially approved the "prepared" believer plan on Thursday to pay off the $5 billion debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to make new films and TV shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, nothing more stands in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will head the somewhat pared-down studio as chief executive.
The number of employees will be reduced from over 400 to around 320.
In fact, Chapter 11 will only come into effect for MGM when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM in production.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings in $75 million, is heading the company.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the assignment to investment bank Moelis & Co., the company's management, which struggled with interest payments of $300 million / year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper ’ s efforts to resolve MGM ’ s financial concerns and pay off the more than 140 believers in the studio took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for sale.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and nobody wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
It all started all over again in the spring of this year, when the MGM-team started the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by creditors at the end of October after months of debates and internal disputes.
When MGM officially survives bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The stake for Moelis & Co., which already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million
Cooper, who was paid for the management of the company monthly $375,000, will receive a "success bonus" of $4 million
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and drew up an annual plan for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They are also planning two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros..
The studio requires a separate bond of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed approximately 18% of MGM ’ s loan, sought to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
But the latest negotiations between the two companies produced no results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year ’ s favorite gift is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gizmos can rip a sizeable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX ’ s for $99, while the price of a Kinect ’ s game equals about 10 classic skipping ropes or about 48 cans of Play ’ s Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I visited three national toy retailers - a Whale Mart, a Toys "R" Us, and a BJ's Wholesale Club - looking for three electronic toys under $80.
I immediately realized that Moore ’ s law had come into force; this year, the technology tools are more powerful and cost slightly less than last year.
And while fewer new toys are released with their own website, the best-known of these are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
More and more button batteries are coming onto the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all Toys prices are "R" Us.)
They are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs, who sing a note when you press on their belly.
Pressing once corresponds to one note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several singers sings the same song in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can't stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, Mickey, the dance star, is the best choice.
Based on the technology developed last year by Elmo Live, the animatronic doll offers interaction like 'Simon Says', and thanks to the new hinge feet with wheel lock, it dominates the Moon Walk.
Children testing the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40, for children over 3), with a whole bunch of question cards, with which a car ride can become a lesson, with a know-it-all with auto-correction and function as a teacher.
If you don ’ t want to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech ’ s MobiGo ($60 for children aged 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty and keyboard. However, the games included are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children aged 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapster ’ s first major revision of the Leapster range.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher ’ s iXL ($90 for children aged 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to its SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for kids 8 and up), which is no bigger than a matchbox and has its own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before time runs out. It ’ s great for an improvised spelling contest.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go alone after the offer in the toy stores, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to give your child an online pet at Club Penguin, you can purchase a Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix'N Match Character Pack ($5 for children aged 6 to 12) that includes a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the online code, your child receives enough credits for two more pieces in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller skates or a puffle.
The latest head-cell powered micro robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children 5 and up) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It is fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he can stand a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and survived even some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police Operations in China Become Softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped across an urban square, checking his nervous subordinates, giving orders with military authority and a muted voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan – China ’ s robust urban guardians, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and inclination to violence – to impress viewers.
"Standing straight!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely outgrown the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive jackets and pants stood taut.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight row.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue and white striped bows.
“For me, they look average, ” Mr. Tang remarked dismissively.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of China ’ s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
Guangdong Province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green one.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced violence with rigidity: in 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled an improperly positioned food truck and stared at the operator until, after half an hour, he packed up and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women reinforce the municipal police patrols. They have been selected specifically for their appearance, good figure and youth.
They are supposed to give the coarse police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately also Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Rightly so, according to the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials can enforce city laws only with fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely presents a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat a bystander to death while he was filming them with his mobile phone as they beat up a protest action against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training handbook of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, which describes how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a scuffle with five officials.
A video game teeming with violence that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan frightens the government," lamented the national newspaper China Daily last year after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough clean-up."
Sceptics say the current approach is markedly inadequate.
When the district advertised for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in Beijing Evening News raised the question of whether the women should have real tasks or merely serve as a visual distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 with good figure and "harmonious features" were sought.
They should be above average in size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches.
The employment relationship ends at the age of 26.
According to the officials, the activity is too strenuous for women over 25.
"The most important thing is their image," said an unnamed district official at the quasi-government Rednet.com website.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first of all on their appearance, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan are like vases of flowers," he said, adding, "but beyond that, they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district city administration, does not agree with this description,
But admitted that in China sizes in job advertisements for both sexes are not unusual.
The same applies to even facial features.
Whether this is to be equated with good appearance, is disputed in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disabilities do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use the lame or hunchback here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who patrolled on the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22, has apple cheeks and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel as sexist that so much emphasis is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks ironically.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
They say they do not regret the short hiring because they have more ambitious career plans than just running traders through the streets to stop them doing business.
Every morning the patrol deals with about twelve street vendors who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bicycle before they are driven away.
"Mr. Wang, please disappear here."
"We have told you so many times!" Miss Xu explains to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his noodle kitchen, which was mounted on a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotonous than strenuous.
“It ’ s almost the same every day, ” explains Huang Jing, a 20-year-old who studies sales in her spare time.
"All routine."
One reason is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate merchandise from traders like their male counterparts.
They can only threaten criminals with reporting them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostility, which officials in China often face.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rioted after rumors circulated that Chengguan officials killed a trader.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officials were injured in the night incident, and 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu was spared such violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square where the female officials patrolled that morning, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that, contrary to regulations, was repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop.
The owner shouted zeter and mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers made their way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male patrol, was left behind, turning his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we act verbally."
"Sometimes, but also physically," Mr. Li explains soberly.

Prosecutor Will Not Accuse Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Department of Justice acquitted Senator John Ensign of charges leveled against him following his affair with a former election aide and his attempt to lobby her husband, Senator ’ s lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision puts an end to the most serious legal charge against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which made headlines nationwide and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election.
As Senator Ensign ’ s office announced, he was “delighted ” with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign ’ s lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigation against Senator Ensign had been stopped and that there were no further charges against him.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The ruling came as a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Justice Department. In their opinion, there was ample evidence that Ensign had violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails, and other documents first disclosed in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of Hampton ’ s election aides, get lucrative contracts to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton ’ s wife, Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was Treasurer during an Ensigns election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the documents and interrogations, he lobbied for them after Hamptons dismissal.
As Hampton was still in Ensign ’ s recent election team, he was not allowed to lobby his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called revolving door ban.
According to the published evidence, "it appears to be an agreement and a violation of the revolving door statutes," according to Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients targeted by the government.
While the Department of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the Department seemed very cautious in taking political charges after a variety of defeats that were followed with great interest by the media, including last year ’ s decision to drop the charges of misconduct against former Senator Ted Stevens.
Prosecutors “are obviously terrible, ” said Melanie Sloan, chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of attorneys who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to justice.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, lead counsel for Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a public prosecutor on Monday and another phone call the next day, informing him that the ministry would not file charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign ’ s counsel had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law. ”
Mr. Coggins refused to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had put to the prosecutors.
“I ’ m not comfortable going into the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just this: we think we ’ ve made the right decision, ” he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to close the investigation into a separate complaint by the Ethics Group alleging that a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign ’ s parents to the Hamptons violated the Federal Elections Act.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that supported the Senator for a long time, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found work with the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 shows that after Mr. Hampton moved on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton in which he told him that he was "knocking" at the Home Office for one thing.
Mr. Ensign was also scheduled for lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton hired them to lobby.
When information about the affair first became public last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and abandoned his position in the Senate, where he ranked fourth in the Republican rankings.
After not noticing for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigation, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, said the Senator hoped that the Ethics Commission would follow the example of the Department of Justice very quickly and stop its investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work serving the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire ’ s Appeal Draws Attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them typed away in the riots in the courtroom.
Every minute, they sent their reports of gruesome eyewitness testimony via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process of rape and bedridden children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the attentive trial of Steven J. Hayes, accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will come to an official end when the death sentence handed down by the jury is passed.
But Mr. Hayes ’ lawyers have already submitted applications to the court, setting out the grounds for an appeal, which will keep the courts busy for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that intensive reporting on the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - had created a "circus atmosphere" and such widespread, immediate penetration of inflammatory details that the jury had been unduly influenced by public outrage.
This objection could lead the courts of appeal to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this trial, I believe that there is a real danger if the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of every individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' lead counsel.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of Appeal, rejected the motions by decision last week, saying that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on the matter.
For decades, court appeals have found that reporting on notorious cases casts doubt on the fairness of a trial.
In its historic decision of 1966, the United States Supreme Court overturned the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who is said to have killed his wife, and said in its decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some believe that the TV series and the feature film "On the Run" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court objections regarding Mr. Hayes ’ conviction half a century later may follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom, which were unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard ’ s case.
"There is good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in trials that are followed by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appeal courts might be fascinated by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many presented by Mr. Hayes ’ lawyers to discuss for years, delaying a conviction.
Defendants also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been convicted when Judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during the selection of the jurors.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke, 48 years, and their daughters, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, would have filled them with disgust.
Defendants say they also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge mistakenly replaced a juror who was a critic of the prosecution, and that he exerted undue pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of extensive reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a court challenge that they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut, and was being discussed by candidates during the campaign for the office of governor and the American Senate.
They argued that the new media had continually rekindled the flames of emotion over the case.
“Such a daily rush of media beepers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom, ” wrote the lawyers,“ has never been seen before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide. ”
Their focus on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists have said that the claim that these direct messages are more inflammatory than reports that are slower is an anti-technology view that impoverishes reporting on future trials.
But some lawyers said that appeal courts are often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes require adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer ’ s attorneys reinforce this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the Supreme Court ruling of 1966, which overturned the conviction of Dr. Sheppard for reporting, and made it clear that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell in the twenty-first century."
Can courtesy join the divisive?
After a campaign of swearwords and negativity, little courtesy erupted in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of genuine bipartisanship, or a moment of illusion, before quickly returning to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the heads of the Congress brought no breakthrough in the big issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which no more decisions were made.
According to what one hears, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of partisan scoring.
The public meeting of the President's deficit commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that persist between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that masks the ideological divide that continues to divide members.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has dawned.
Both sides are now in a test phase - demanding one from the other sign of cooperation and compromise, while trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and voters' patience after another party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it is about taxes, donations, health or entitlements, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November elections in Washington have been lenient for at least a short time.
"No doubt, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official in the Bush administration who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections arouse partisan passions that die again.
And that is a good thing. "
On some issues, especially those on the lame duck session agenda, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. "
Bush ’ s tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports them.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all, be it temporary or permanent.
Likewise, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe the favored tax cuts for the rich while refusing to support unemployed workers.
Following Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there has been an increase in optimism that agreement can be reached on these issues during the lame duck session, while at the same time ratifying the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent lame duck issues "need not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - that courtesy leads to true cooperation.
“I see a lot of what will happen from now until 2012 as preliminaries, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012, ” he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the make-up of the new Republican White House majority and the tea party, which served to educate voters.
Whatever concerns Republican leaders may have about playing too high, they know that they must try to keep their promises to cut government spending and repeal health-care reform.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the deficit commission ’ s recommendations, which include tax reform and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age, and lowering government spending.
Vice-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation, and they struggle hard to get anywhere near that number.
The greatest resistance is to be found in the elected representatives of the body, because on financial issues, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and congressional Republicans.
The first fight will take the form of party clashes next year, when Republicans challenge Obama on the state budget, taxes, and health-care systems, followed later by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to an impasse, as happened in 1995, both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partiality and polarization are larger today than they were in the mid-1990 ’ s, and they seem to be a larger ideological divide between Obama and Congress than between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more far-reaching election in 2012.
In this sense, the courtesy displayed this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator on the issues that still separate them.
Leaked US document portraying Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it passes on part of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, as reported in February by the American Embassy in Russia in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service extort high protection money so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organised criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the 'vertical of authority' - takes its share of the money that moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on his homepage by WikiLeaks on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow ’ s mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
It was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that it has been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have consistently rejected accusations of corruption for years, and he has won numerous libel suits against such accusations.
In September, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt, he told a Russian TV station, "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual, as the Ambassador's report does, for individuals to be named, and it is unheard of that this should be done by a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow Government with crime has led some to describe it as' disturbed 'and to conclude that the government is acting more like a kleptocrat than a government," the memo said.
"Criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna "(a term from the world of criminals / mafia, which literally means" roof "or protection) that extends across the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Supervision Authority (MVD) and the Prosecutor's Office, as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layered structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top of the list."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Last, the common criminals and the criminal inspectors follow on the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas because the city offers no help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the biggest companies and that the police arrest small businessmen.
One source, it is said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is not as much in demand as before."
The memo notes that while the collection of funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is very modest none; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the embassy contains descriptions of men going to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, in a recent interview.
"But he is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class, because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, so estimates Indem, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey of the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence International (countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The unveiling of the memo by the American Embassy, which occurred late in the evening after Moscow, will certainly cause displeasure within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow ’ s mistakes, it may also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are being solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats have named him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
“But to be honest, we didn ’ t expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure, and in such an unethical way, you know. ”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds us of the man who built him, of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the butcher" because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge reign, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-time supporters of Anlong Veng are being challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to engage in public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that tells the story of the Khmer Rouge to former soldiers for the first time.
And, in July, a joint UN and Cambodia tribunal first sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge to 35 years in prison when it sentenced the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Alnlong Veng ’ s Khmer Rouge veterans, impeding their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodian society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organisation investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It even divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, overwork, or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot Ied government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary waged guerrilla warfare from their base in the western mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok brought the next generation into Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country ’ s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move into government, leading to the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who did not give in, was arrested by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh Prison, awaiting his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the grueling poverty of rural Cambodia, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the Court will try Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The Court ’ s mandate is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has done little to ease the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge ’ s rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told officials at the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that she was leading the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are believed to have died.
One hot evening Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem declined to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court charged more suspects, even though experts and historians are discussing this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer" means gathering the broken pieces, "he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that like everything can understand."
The Centre created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the High-School History Book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As is often the case in Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city ’ s links with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be convicted by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the schoolbook and the court are gradually gaining influence, "he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, a path overgrown with bushes and dirty with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot ’ s body was burned here on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile phone saleswoman by the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will lay aside a bush of ripe bananas in the hope that it will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees not to continue accumulating weapons-grade uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama ’ s campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security summit.
The US government had been trying for years to persuade Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium, and seemed to have passed a hurdle last spring.
But US officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements were made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for the deal on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama's April "Nuclear Security Summit of 47 Nations", which excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (2012). ”
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a Nuclear Security Group.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under George W. Bush ’ s administration.
At the time of Obama ’ s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is basically weapons-grade, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... We won't make dirty bombs of it and we won't sell it to anyone".
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all".
Belarus nevertheless approached the US a few months ago, when it indicated interest in reaching an agreement.
The first attempt to remove uranium of Belarus in October was especially difficult because the material was slightly irradiated, say officials.
It was loaded into a special train, which will take more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say officials.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and, according to the officials, was carried out by plane.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money going to Belarusian research into low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust, ” said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on global risk reduction, which led to the agreement being signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Non-Transfer Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus intends to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko ’ s flagrant disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday ’ s statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
“Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens, ” she explains.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected in documents enveloped by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (via cable). It is added that the former deputy head of government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "in order to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega debated with each other after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe which denounced aiding and abetting human rights abuses in a dozen countries, including Spain.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the Council's report had "met Zapatero on the sidelines" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed", in order not to be "surprised unprepared", reports Aguirre by cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence because it is in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, the Attorney General, Vicente González, informed the Embassy that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish National Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on the CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating or sensitive information," the Ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information provided by the CNI and the Department of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts towards discretion between governments," complains Aguirre.
At lunch in March 2007, attended by the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely attached to their independence and do what they deem appropriate," he had instructed his staff to "avoid bloated rhetorical comments in order to relieve the tension."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the actions of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, pointing out that the Zapatero government has tolerated or intentionally ignored US actions that could be interpreted as human rights violations, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government," he points out.
The child murderer confesses that she complained on the Internet about the "hardship" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when it was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror the Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is in the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she has had since childhood, she keeps in contact with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The Communications are from 2008.
To understand them, one has to know their love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of the testimonies of their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman started a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She lasted one year.
Shortly after she dissolved her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his alumni never let him do DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into another relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring parish.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very peculiar and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he thought it was good, but now of course he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free to do and leave what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she has just received on her mobile phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send the boy to you."
She complains: "If he doesn't like it that I leave the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I'm back."
In May she talks about returning to her village: "This week I will go there, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she will take her firstborn with her if all goes well.
"He will be with the one he must be with, that is, with me. Never in my life will I leave him with someone except my mother," a dubious intention when one considers their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy, who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th, is dead.
"On the one hand César is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand he is with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She speaks of a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer school, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On 17: Memories and lamentations.
"A giant kiss from César, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the E-Mail. See, if he wants, he finds me, such a crap."
On the 30th one more thing: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots money in front of me."
On the internet, in anime and manga logs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now blocked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prisoner released".
"Terror a la gallega (Heading)".
The last man to live with her, a sworn hunter, says he has pangs of conscience because he feels guilty.
He cannot believe that everything happened because she had not told him that she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the Menorca Prisoners' Centre to the provincial prison in Palma.
The Public Defender, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the facts of the case, "and she had no intention of causing harm to the little one."
Before that, however, she had confessed to having drowned César in the bathtub and stowed his body in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecution requested a psychiatric report.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in the number of votes and members of parliament in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking to the parliamentary elections - preferably or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party obtains in these elections is usually twice that of the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People ’ s Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, compared with only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of redirecting the PSC ’ s share of the vote and binding the PP ’ s electorate - continues, the PP analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen in parliamentary elections, while CiU would win four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 deputies (out of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one MEP - it currently has three - while the ICV could hold or win one MEP.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date for the municipal elections will be May 2011, when the People ’ s Party (PP) will be on the scales to put an end to socialist domination in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People ’ s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists can neither win a majority nor have recourse to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council, where it would have to win 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in Tarragona ’ s upheaval, where they ruled together with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - they met several times during the last election campaign.
The People's Party has also seen significant growth in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus.
The PP is currently represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell obtained thousands of passports for Al Qaeda
Besides the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by the intelligence officers of the Barcelona Police Force constituted the Thai-controlled jihadist cell that supplied passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Liberation Movement of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e behandlung Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the attacks in Bombay that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, to the extent that he asserts that Al Qaeda's "Operation Kampai" has "weakened" the counterfeiting apparatus worldwide and "thus its ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries with impunity.
The exposed cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police forces also participated in the investigation. It cannot be excluded that similar attacks will occur in the territory of the EU in the coming days, such as the one that was carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was carried out in Thailand, where the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had directed from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was destroyed in 2009 - in particular stole tourists' passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This meant that the documents had to be issued in the name of men aged 25 to 45 and still valid for several years; they could not have a visa stamp.
Investigative circles underline that up to now no connections between those arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay have been established, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar and Taiba", was one of the groups of recipients of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination, several thousand dollars had been shipped from Catalonia by means of a transfer of funds, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid mobile phone cards, later used by the members of the "Command", which put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have confiscated extensive documentation.
PP asks Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present personally to Artur Mas the terms of her support for his entry into office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are no different from those already put forward during the election campaign and can be summed up by the primacy of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement that the regional leader wants to propose at the height of his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People ’ s Party turned with certainty to Artur Mas, who awarded her the 18 MPs she won last Sunday – a paragraph that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable, because the candidate from the bourgeois, regionalist CiU party depends on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining from the vote when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to form in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible Entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As far as the party leader of the PPC is concerned, she calls for 'all the discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia', as well as an agreement on financial equalisation between the state and the autonomous region - similar to the one in the Basque country - and which the party leader of CiU even wants to subject to a referendum, to be put on the back burner.
What both leaders have in common is that they want to streamline the exaggerated political apparatus of the regional administration and abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat from the PPC are discussing the details of the negotiations for Mas taking office.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV), and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric care home affirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the old people ’ s home in Olot do not rule out that their caregiver killed over eleven elderly people
The people in charge of the La Caritat home for the elderly in Olot (Gerona) held a press conference yesterday in which they highlighted the damage that the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the carer who killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible - had done to the institution.
The head of the Home for the Elderly, Joan Sala, appeared before the court accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat wants to indict the person responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability".
Not only does the institution suffer a loss of social standing because it did not detect the criminal acts of the carer in time, but it now also pays a large amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old people's home - because he suspected that no doctor personally examined the deceased, but the formalities due to their age and diseases were handled by telephone.
The director of La Caritat flatly denied this point and explained that "failure to take action at the time may have been the reason for the events."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the case there is no evidence of negligence on the part of any person other than the accused."
The day before yesterday, he who had already been baptized as an "angel of death" confessed to eleven murders and declared that the first crime had been committed on 29 August 2009 and that the second old lady had been murdered a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime, in which he administered a mixture of various sedatives.
The director of La Caritat said that the access of the personnel to the medicines was difficult to control.
The caregiver used the insulin injections and the sedative cocktail in six out of nine crimes committed in order to relieve the patients of their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will reveal whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them from the inside by giving them bleach, as he had done, according to confession, with three women whom he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, one does not believe the statements of the custodian, not even in terms of the number of murders committed, which could well be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it made no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made them available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
European Central Bank (ECB) threatening gesture
Investors yesterday reacted sharply to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our responsiveness."
Euro periphery countries ’ risk premiums have risen dramatically, and European banks ’ shares have risen by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be mistaken and that the euro has barely increased in points, which is a cause for concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market that is recovering as it collapses, but following the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor is far from losing his fear.
A month ago today, the European Central Bank asked us to reverse our liquidity measures, after which tomorrow, for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future, the ECB will have to back down.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to purchase sovereign debt, which was ineffective, and the abolition of all extraordinary temporary liquidity measures. Only one week of indefinite access was to be maintained.
In the wake of the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended 'at least until March' and the quarterly unlimited tenders to be maintained at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the bond-buying programme to continue and give a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of yesterday's markets will be thrown back, and if the half-stubborn insistence is put on withdrawing our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
This story could be repeated tomorrow, as it was at the ECB ’ s May meeting, when the bank affirmed that it would not consider buying government debt, and markets collapsed.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was rather weak.
State asset management spent only 5.28% of 500 million compared to 4.81% of 750 million in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points along the curve, reflecting a change in market perceptions, according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the Allied and Bank of Ireland debt hole figures have been published.
The sum is estimated at around 10,000 million in the short term and possibly another 15,000, and there is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has lost all credibility after failing to recognize the problem of the July stress tests, the rescue plan ’ s figures are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and, as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland continues to be a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated her discourse in view of the summit of heads of state and government on 14 December, where political unity is needed to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
Yesterday, the President of the Spanish Government presented the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the Autonomous Regions as well as in financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound like Vivaldi ’ s Four Seasons in the ears of investors.
The Zapatero and Trichet double effect explains why the Spanish stock market grew by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock markets.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish Central Bank has been swift and convincing, and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond, which will take advantage of the Trichet effect. Therefore, we rely on strong demand, which will eliminate any doubts about our debt restructuring capacity.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
The Treasury has 40 billion euros at its disposal, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar's wife's motto: 'Now it is not only being that counts, but also appearance'.
Courage, we can do it!
The Chairman of the Board of Eulen challenges the General Assembly of Vega Sicilia at the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owner of the companies Owls and El Enebro, does not abate.
David Alvarez, founder of the company gurppe, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will be held on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, considering it "absolutely null and void." His children will try to obtain a majority to control the management bodies of the company, which owns the Bodegas Vega Sicilia winery.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not seem to be prepared to give in to his dispute over control of the El Enebro institutions.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders ’ meeting on 18 January this year, which is already entered in the Commercial Register as contested.
The Shareholders ’ Meeting of El Enebro, convened for the 16th by the Judge of Madrid Commercial Court No. 2, has triggered a new thunderclap in the lap of the Álvarez family.
Appealing to the judge for the appointment of the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convocation of the general meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to have the annulled assembly of 18 January recognised by means of legal sophistry, fraudulent dealings and abuse of rights", as official spokespersons explain.
This reasoning is the basis for challenging the Assembly retrospectively to declare it "absolutely null and void".
The same protagonists, cloaked in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting through the courts.
In El Enebro - an asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez 'seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the services group demands the right to use over 51% of the capital.
That is the real background to the case on which the judge has to decide at the hearing to deal with the challenge for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved in real time with software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this exquisite universe of speed has been marked by surprises and successes.
At the beginning, nobody paid any attention to the newcomer and despite his steep career during the last seasons, they all relied on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso in the final sprint last November.
Without wishing to diminish the skills of the German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the performance of the Renault engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into his hands, thus creating a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes, which the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that have nothing to do with car racing.
This computer program, known as PLM, has been used to develop assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is to faithfully reproduce or simulate a product or process before it is actually built, in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan ’ s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial department at Siemens, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 - Red Bull factory "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes and improvements that are detected in the races and in the tests can be designed and carried out.
Russwurm explains that in 1992, an average of ten technicians worked in the racing stables, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
Today, Red Bulls ’ team employs 180 highly qualified young people, who carry out analyses and make all kinds of changes to the race car using powerful computing equipment.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM is capable of analysing and improving all the components of Red Bull ’ s race cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
Thanks to advanced production equipment and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours.
The only limit that is set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that a Formula 1 team can spend on its races in one season.
Red Bull has set up its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a village 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - particularly by journalists - are very limited.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drinks manufacturer puts at the service of his participation on the race tracks, hide other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose notoriety is zero.
The plant ’ s Chief Technology Officer, Steve Nevey, points out that five years ago it could still be said that advances in R & D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and that the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, the shares have changed, with technology accounting for 85 percent of the success, while the pilots ’ contribution is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty stores with local distributors in two years
Yesterday in Barcelona, Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a network of twenty shops, each measuring between 80 and 100 square metres, that the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operation, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP España vice-president Helena Herrero cited as an example the converted store on Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been collaborating for thirty years.
The North American group intends to set up 200 outlets in Europe by 2010, 20 of which are in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third store.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming new openings, but did not exclude that Madrid could be the next destination.
The vice chairman, who is also the director of HP Personal Systems, stated that the store opening philosophy is always the same, based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive store equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for the training of store staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive network of points of sale was intended "to optimise customer service and advice for small and micro-enterprises in purchasing and then, even packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneer “pilot program ” that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro enterprises as well as private customers, since the large enterprises already have their technical service contracts", Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'steal' a million customers from its rival in three years
Banco Sabadell ’ s managing director, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nonetheless, he foresees a collapse in interest-rate spreads, which banks are trying to offset by raising the fees and prices of loans.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - a profession still to be established.
Sabadell has found the way to make the most of the next three years and thus to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year master plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without receiving public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000 if we deduct the customers the bank will lose - which is the great challenge facing this bank, which has so far paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 businesses.
Their market share among private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011 business plan is to increase productivity, i.e. austerity, and reduce costs. The challenges the Bank is facing with this plan will be presented together with the annual report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the global financial crisis has disrupted all bank plans.
This year, Sabadell will complete its Optima roadmap, which was initially designed for three years but was extended by one year due to the market situation.
The clients who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "long range".
The manager assumes that Spain is emerging "slowly" from the crisis.
It would also be 'very difficult' to 'create work' in two or three years' time - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war over liabilities - which penalizes interest rate margins - will abate, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks have to pay for their issuance in order to maintain liquidity will already be shifted onto the price of credit as compensation for dwindling profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will put pressure on the loans."
“We didn ’ t turn off the tap, but the interest rate differentials are very high, ” Guardiola admitted.
On Thursday, Banesto issued an order to its network of branches to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase the interest rate differential (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the strategy of 'increasing charges', but 'within a competitive framework'.
Sabadell ’ s plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
Not for nothing does he assure that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"Everything will change next year," he says.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "increasing enormously" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will fall into the red.
He is of the opinion that the FROB can replace the money market with capital increases.
Ensuring that Sabadell can survive a temporary market shutdown, he invalidates the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be put into circulation, but that, unlike what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through repo transactions and thus the crisis can be absorbed.
CECA excludes a second wave of mergers between savings banks
CECA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday rejected the possibility of a wave of mergers among savings banks and stressed the speed with which the sector was being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several banks insisted on not participating in the first phase. They reserved the second round.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Savings Banks Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed, and the inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, but rather an adjustment."
"Most of it is done. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all the important processes have already been completed, and they were controlled by Banco de España, which strongly supported all the processes."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process "has been completed as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process that was established in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, which means that we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta said that "there are a number of unbiased opinions about the slowness of the process, which reveal unreliability and nonsense," because "Banco de España urges us to complete before the end of the year."
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous funding systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the world, adding that those who doubt it would do so "without a deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that, in the current economic climate, we do not need to 'worry' about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a 'very important' concentration process that will be carried out 'as quickly as possible'.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests conducted by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin opted to keep the euro, but at the same time laid down conditions for the whole of the European Union.
Market tensions have triggered a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment agencies or the abolition of the EUR 426 support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former governor Felipe González supports the criticism of the chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible person, who had evoked the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is to be anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of her public relations.
On the contrary, this is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
At the same time, Germany is taking a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which is clashing with the preservation of the traditional traditions of a large part of its partners.
Faced with resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: the reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although this currently sounds more like science fiction - supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third is a restructuring of the euro in line with German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that fail to comply; possible default by some countries; and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been emerging for some time. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits, and the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany deemed necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second signal came from the Central European country, when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to bail out Greece.
This was strongly criticized at the time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the published opinion were absolutely against rescuing Greece.
After all, in the last few days of October, Merkel has come out with a clear position calling for a reform of the European Union ’ s agreements to enable a country to be saved, while at the same time obliging private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as being anti-European, as it drove forward the Irish crisis and everything that followed.
Over the next few months, we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which should make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures now have to be taken, the old way of operating the euro will cease to exist from that date on.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area, in which the offending countries can be severely punished, forced to default, and in which the private sector will have to bear part of the cost.
Germany is showing us that we need to take a tough growth path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on indebtedness and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as advocated by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It is not just a question of reducing the government deficit to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will become more calm.
And that we will make use of the opportunities we are offered by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after last Saturday ’ s meeting with the big companies, and yesterday ’ s announcement of new measures) points to the fact that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in one ’ s own house has paved the way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look as if anything would change.
One of the possibilities being considered is that we would have to leave the euro area, which is crammed full of unreputable countries.
In that case, Germany could still tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and regulatory evasion
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to evade a sanction.
The exclusion allegedly instigated by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being spilled over whether it was a non-sporting act or not and whether both players should possibly be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed sanction for the next league game against the Auxerre, thus entering the next phase of play without any cards.
Finally, UEFA ’ s disciplinary committee punished the club ’ s coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
Provoking a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules followed in this sport.
Part of the debate surrounding the case in question stems from the leading role played by a Real Madrid football team (which pretends to have nobility and honor in its anthem and has punished its players for similar incidents on other occasions), and from the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this behaviour, which is expressly forbidden by the statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts constitute a circumvention of the rules. Indeed, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused to sportsmanship should be investigated.
The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not jeopardized by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the offending players take an unjustified advantage of the opposing team. That, too, did not happen.
The paradox of the Real Madrid players' action is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand by false play or evasion of rules, because the evasion of the rule was not carried out secretly in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as noticeable as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders derived from the intentional fouls.
It should be pointed out here that the rival was neither placed in an unfavorable position nor were advantages required for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue to play with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The obvious advantage is that players can enter the next phase of the Champions League without any cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, to a certain extent uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually be eliminated. In addition, players receive a sanction with this approach and enter the second cycle of cards, in which they are eliminated less than in the first cycle due to card accumulation with a card.
So it is not so clear whether this is really an advantage.
At the end of the day, such practices are not contrary to sportsmanship, which includes making strategic choices to make the most of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to evade a sanction (this would be a definite case of rule evasion), they would rather choose when to undergo it.
They made a strategic decision without evading or escaping punishment.
Although the boundary between inventiveness and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemic arose as a result of two factors: two self-exclusions and the nature of the provocative transfer of rules.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these acts is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer Campaign to Catch Customers for Group Christmas Dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar drops this year an avalanche of reservations on the days 16 and 17 December.
Celebrations paid for by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the run-up to Christmas, which supply the catering and leisure industry of Barcelona with oxygen. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive in order to also capture the customer segment, which is the great mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, confirm the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations.
To complicate the bookkeeping a bit, the calendar (New Year falls on a Friday) dropped all orders in the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of reservations of dinners on two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have discontinued group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to have to do without this tradition, many workers pay for it out of their own pockets.
Whatever the economic situation, the demand for the lowest prices has been confirmed by Gaietà Farràs, chairman of the Barcelona Catering Council.
The representative of the umbrella organization does not dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think twice before making a reservation."
"They want to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to prices," he says.
Business will go well with those "offering quality at good prices with good service", he adds, and reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand by 25 euros.
A survey in various centrally located restaurants revealed that the evening of 17 December led to the collapse of the providers.
According to the Soteras Group, the demand for this Friday ’ s menus is booming, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros. Soteras Group has adapted its menus to the economic situation, with complete offers ranging from 25 to 35 euros.
With another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
“We made the impossible possible, in order to maintain the previous year prices with menus for each taste from 19,95 to 30 euro ”, explains it.
At AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 restaurants, one does not lose the optimism, after since the second quarter the incomes bloom again and good, even if on few days concentrated prospects for the Christmas business one looks forward.
Sources of the company group point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
In addition to the six group menus, a Christmas menu has been added for 30 euros or more as a prize hit. It seems that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than last year and want more details in return, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you can see green shoots sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. It gives the impression that the group meals are on the upswing again.
On the part of the umbrella organisation Fecasarm (with associations such as the Barcelona Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are overall quite "lively", although the customers "strike out a maximum".
However, the fun of partying has not decreased, no matter who pays.
Pakistan ’ s nuclear program is a major concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country."
Wikileak revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US Department of State revealed by the Wikileaks internet portal confirm the enormous concerns of the Pakistan nuclear program Washington.
On the fringes of the clarifying and juicy details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not being stepped up, but on the contrary is' decreasing ', and that the unstable Asian country is producing more nuclear weapons' at a faster rate than any other country '.
In particular, the peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that weapons are not assembled, but that their parts are stored to make their destruction more difficult in the event of an attack - is causing Washington sleepless nights.
The Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, mentions the following risks in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear plants to the area attacked by the Taliban, the probable dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer seen by the US alone, but also by Russia, as excessive and a reason for caution.
"Pakistan must employ strict religious personnel to guard its nuclear facilities; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to reclaim people involved in nuclear or missile programs," said Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
A new feature of the documentation revealed by Julian Assange ’ s Internet portal is the decline in US-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation and the accelerated pace at which Pakistan manufactures nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the Embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," declared: "Often there is no transparency; we receive no response to aid offers or they are rejected."
In another communiqué, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons faster than any other country."
Ambassador Patterson called on Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify" to the person responsible that "Pakistan's army must cease its tacit support of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for WikiLeaks boss
Obama appoints a senior figure to fight terrorism to prevent new revelations.
Interpol is issuing a red alert to track and locate Assange.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which it is difficult to clarify matters.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a 'red alert' to 'find and prosecute' Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Furthermore, it is not new, it is dated 20 November.
Nor has it anything to do with the recent disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
Mark Stephens, Wikileaks' founder's lawyer, also assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange."
On the 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not disclosed until yesterday after the Swedish authorities had granted it.
That's where things are. Interpol's 188 countries are instructed to identify and locate Assange "in order to arrest and extradite him provisionally."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member countries, according to the organization, regard the red warning as a carte blanche for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be staying.
The proceedings shocked Assange ’ s lawyers, who published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer the Swedish authorities ’ questions via video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for permission to leave Sweden and was granted permission by the prosecutor, who is compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief of security for Stalin.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter denounces.
While the world looks for him - and his mother, from Australia, asserts her son's innocence - Assange is in an unknown place, but not in silence.
On Monday, he gave an interview to Time magazine ’ s editor via Skype from an indefinite location, during which he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that it was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international agreements signed by the US, it would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation 'ridiculous and absurd'.
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has appointed a senior figure in the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama ’ s spokesman to pay less attention to Assange contradicts the views proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of including WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to seize their funds and pursue anyone who supports or contributes to them."
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to retract his statement that Assange must be "murdered."
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former Arkansas governor, and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever leaked information in the government is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution is too lenient a punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós looking with a twinkle to the Carod related peace in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the party a secret ballot on its continuance in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the General Assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for avoiding, for the umpteenth time, internal turmoil in the ranks of the ERC, which has lost 11 deputies and half its votes.
The party ’ s leader is aware that his threat to resign is not enough for those close to former party leader Josep Lluís Carod in Rovira, but he also knows that the sector ’ s influence is now as weakened as its mentor and will not cause him the same headache as other former tendencies.
That is why the leader of Esquerra is trying with a wink to win over the new critics, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For starters, announced yesterday that the more than 200 regional councilors of ERC could comment on his remaining in office in secret.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the Carodists wanted to give the President a fine, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the impression of both division and submission to his person.
In several interviews, he affirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half the votes plus one, and added, without any percentage, that a result "Bulgarian-style" would not be good either.
The people close to Puigcercós demand more from the president than just to make his office available to the party. An insufficient gesture, since Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the board a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which the leadership will submit to the Council for a vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós. In return, he is supposed to promise to bring the Congress forward to the autumn of 2011, which the party leaders already believe to be a fact.
The leader of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" is detrimental to stability and he is striving once and for all to put the organisation in a position to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the current conseller Josep Huguet on his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologue, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for different goals".
He listed five, two of which are in the foreground.
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally abandon the Assembly principle as a way of operating.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the statutes, which should make it possible to hold congresses with elected delegates.
From the end of the General Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, which had already fought for it at the last two congresses, is as obsessed.
In fact, at the quaking 2008 meeting, the party leadership was mandated to review the general assembly principle at a congress that would deal with reforming the statutes.
This date has not yet been set, as information from the internal turmoil of recent years has shown that it was not advisable to tackle this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors lying in wait, the time may have come to reopen this matter and to conclude it forever.
23 murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO census, four fewer cases were recorded in Mexico than in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in México, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the MILENIO México census.

The man had a wound caused by the shot of a firearm in the neck.
In the middle of the month, it was reported that two men were murdered, wrapped in blankets and found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the community of Tizapán de Zaragoza. Besides the victims, two death threats were also found.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement of Valle de los Reyes in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the remaining body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women wrapped in blankets were found in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the community of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, the corpse of a man wrapped in a yellow blue blanket was found. According to the information left by his murderers next to him, his name was probably Mario Ríos.
In the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found with bullets from firearms on her neck.
Tattoos of Santa Muerte as well as chains with corresponding pictures were discovered on the skin of the woman.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group was found beside a vehicle in the community of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men whose heads were covered with tape and a report were discovered in the community of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Across from the body was a message, probably signed by a criminal organization, which read: "This is happening to those who do not participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies bound hand and foot with signs of torture were found inside a taxi parked behind the judicial center of the San Agustín settlement.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancon settlement and was tied up in black plastic bags, with a message next to it. The second had been tortured and was found in a plastic bag on the streets of the Juárez settlement.
Next to him, the police found a piece of cardboard with a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
At COP16, China ’ s representative said that its country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon emissions, and that it would maintain its offer to cut 40-45% of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China holds its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, affirms Su Wei, the country ’ s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP16), Su Wei asserted that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon emissions and convert its industry.
He said that over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
On the other hand, he said that China would not change its objectives, but would work with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption last year of a new energy law that includes targets for reducing gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the state authorities had worked with the central state and the municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, effective use of energy, and reduction of emissions.
He also pointed out that some multi-annual plans have already been started or completed, both those financed by the Chinese Government and those that have received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which was introduced in the last five years and received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and private investors.
There is also a provincial project on climate change, another on replacing traditional light bulbs with energy-saving ones, and another on mitigation and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, China ’ s scientific adviser on climate change, confirmed that China ’ s efforts are far greater than is commonly believed.
He pointed out that per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China are six tonnes per person, while in the United States they are 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a 9% total contribution to pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has increased by twenty percent in the last five years and is set to increase by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former Pan party leader had the right to appeal to the National Commission of Order and to demand what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, affirmed that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former leader of the PAN had the right to appeal to the National Commission of Order and to demand what the right granted him.
In an interview that preceded Gabino Cué Monteagudo ’ s complaint as governor of the state, he said that Espino ’ s exclusion was a decision taken at local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Regulatory Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to appeal in his case to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be taken by a competent body", he added.
On the other hand, he said, it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with presidential candidates had never been at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge strengthened from the internal vote on December 4 and 5, when his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for municipal elections, it was successful and served its purpose," he said.
The panist leader said that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary," we enjoy it and it strengthens us, "he commented.
He said that the Council would no doubt select the best president (s) that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would hand over the baton "to the one the Council would designate."
"I am completely unconcerned and open. I would be proud to give each of the five the position of party chairman."
He predicted that the party ’ s upswing in the last election on July 4 would be reflected in the next elections, although “it is not time to think about 2012. ”
"The task now is to support Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and aspirations are placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is up to the task."
When asked about PRI ’ s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his discourse in his four-year administration, César Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should begin to defend them, they should finally come out of the closet," he said.
He is of the opinion that the holder of the federal government can make expressions like those he makes in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no mouth ban and even less a censorship.
Obama ’ s Twitter campaign for law to benefit undocumented students
“If you ’ re in favour of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and push for the passing of this law, ” tweeted the president of the United States in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today backed a nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act, a law to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you're in favour of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and push for the passing of that law," Obama tweeted.
Its memorandum contains a cyberlink to a larger document inviting the public to contact their senators in particular, as the vote on the law is imminent.
"With your voice, which we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he stresses.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law except by extending the Bush tax cuts and funding the government.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republicans ’ blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the remaining projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be resolved before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can come to an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the rest," he said.
The chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request a vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act, which would allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students to be voted in the Senate next Thursday, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act or the Law of the American Dream would legalise approximately 800 000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, have lived in that country for the last five years and are enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the advocates of the law require sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of advocates of this project are organizing a strong influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the bill.
So defenders of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would stop supporting it on another occasion.
Another Republican who advocated the bill, John McCain, has not yet determined his position.
Although the House has a different version, analysts agree that the Senate ’ s Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Desire for Language' was a walk in which the participants stood up for the narrative
"I understand the sex in language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature and used the subtitle of her question on that occasion (at another event the round table was dedicated to sex in language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "gets us into trouble," the Argentinean writer spat sweetly at the audience, which was composed mainly of young people who came together at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and which Shultz then described as a great story. Luisa is the first person to narrate and is the protagonist, who is looking to find out what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, from which she receives no answer, but hints for the guidelines of her story.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps that is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath away in the middle of the corridor and explained to her that wound is not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs with relief and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it was really open and did not exist." But she is convinced that the pleasure of language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful tale, which he called 'Praise of the Invention', in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back men who had traveled far away, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. It made a U-turn and told of America, the great novel that did not lack its own chronicler from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), mocked the pretended witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told - with imagination, which even lost its sense of shame."
However, he emphasizes that "it is the madmen and liars who imagine things the best," and that is where reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows to which side the story belongs, where fictional literature reaches its climax.
He actually calls this the 'Cervantes Tradition'.
"From him we have inherited to be what is told."
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which FIl's invitation to the round table 'The finger in the wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that afflicts her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs, contain a tacit, not purposely planned engagement," she said after emphasizing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the reader as if in a "chemical reaction."
The evening was concluded by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the committed writer in the writer's wound".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and the control of consciousness also boil down to dogmatism, and he forgets "that behind every affirmation is a little no, and behind every denial a little yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and of reality, we have to nuance: and nuancing often means putting one's finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when thinking in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also harassing the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noted, inviting them to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three losses in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he played decisive games three times.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles set by their respective coaches, and their contradictory encounter is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano can look back on three losses in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he has had decisive games three times, and so far he has held himself well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance for him.
The Argentinean has played his way up to the second champion with the medal, he is one step behind the winners and surprisingly he played with the same team consecutive finals.
The santistic strategist reached the first final as coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hands, with which he experienced a big defeat against Toluca with 4, 2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3, 1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take a setback again, because the game ended with a draw with 2: 2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shot he advanced with 3: 1 and got two possibilities to take his title, but in the end three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned into a 4: 3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he does not want to be pursued again by misfortune and free himself from the evil spell to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection to which I give myself, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," the helmsman commented when asked about the lost finals.
He still has a strong memory of the final, he assures us that he has learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the referee whistles the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were already prepared with two elevenmeters to be eliminated, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no reason to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shootouts does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to reach the penalty shootout, you want to finish in regulation time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the strong desire to hold the title already in our hands, that left us something for this final, and we hope that this time it won't happen."
It is in Romanso ’ s power to stop being the second champion and to taste the fame the titles bring for the first time.
The US changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons are required to present themselves at the visa application services at the consulate before their interview, thus reducing waiting times.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for visas at the United States Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will have to present themselves to the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English) before going to the consulate.
The ASC staff collects the biometric data of the applicant, which are checked by the consulate before the interview.
The new process has certain advantages for aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa decreases, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately for arranging the appointment, processing the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed over.
The applicant makes only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for traders and investors.
Those who just want to extend their visa do not have to talk to the consulate, they only have to introduce themselves to the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
As the biometric data are collected at the ASC, applicants needing a second appointment at the consulate will have less time than before.
Those who apply for a visa at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will not have to pay the $26 service surcharge.

NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The North American Space Agency convened a press conference to present a find tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living creatures in space.
Tomorrow, Thursday, the United States National Aerospace Agency (NASA) will announce an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented by astrobiology experts at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington tomorrow at 1: 00 p.m. This is a science that investigates the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When convening the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a supervising find for the search of extraterrestrial life," which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could substantiate the theory that it could exist in hostile environments that were previously considered uninhabitable, human-like creatures. The hypothesis was raised that these could transform into intelligent creatures, such as humans, if their living conditions improved.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite, California, where it lives in an environment considered too toxic for all forms of life, as the lake is strongly arsenic.
In one way or another, the microbial uses arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this ability into account increases the chances that there may be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to astrobiologists, it is proven that "there is actually another life form, a second life form, which differs from the one we know."
The Space Agency will announce the actual scope of its finding at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference is attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (Saturn ’ s largest moon) to determine whether its chemical composition resembles that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
The reform of the Congressional Organic Law introduces the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and an opposition bloc was already in place, led by members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia, and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented himself as an independent.
Prior to the inaugural session of the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD, and Patrón Montalvo protested against the reform of the Organic Law, arguing that it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties, controlling Congress.
These four deputies, along with the coordinator of the PRD, Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, were the only ones to vote against the presidency led by the panicist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as deputy president.
Corvera Quevedo said that with these reforms the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political marginalization.
He said that in the next few days, they would talk to the representatives of the PAN and the PRI in order to change the pattern, based on their political will, and if they did not, they would be subjugated by both parties again, thus putting an end to the opposition coalition.
"Here I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, which do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia said that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic."
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there should be an eternal two-party system in Congress."
"For starters, this group starts with five members and they talk to other colleagues to make them more," Convergencia said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, alluding to the PAN and the PRI, argued that Congress has now turned into a 'booty' for two.
"Before it was only one party, now they split it up into two."
Patrón Montalvo requested that MEPs be respected and given their place at the negotiating tables.
"Five, who are likely to be nine MEPs, must not be left out because of top decisions; the five, who are currently seen as divided into different political groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because it is reform carried out and agreed by the others that has left us out and we disagree with this reform."
200 000 pesos more for "the supplier"
The municipality of Mazatlán pays another cheque to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another cheque for just over 200,000 pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the municipality.
This means that the sum paid in the second half of the year to the owner of the company for electrical material is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the Transparency page of the Municipality, this cheque for 200,144.56 pesos, with the number 9258447, was issued on 16 November last with the purpose of "settling open accounts".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already said that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier, who is watched by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at inflated prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount owed to her and consequently the number of cheques that are still being issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, just the debts are paid, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29 and the last one of November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when a company is challenged by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for its services, the treasurer assured that its services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste published on July 25 the audit of the cheques issued by the municipality to its suppliers, it became known that previously, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid more than 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with Jumapam, where she collected cheques worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist places must be improved urgently
Tourism companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the Mazatlán tourism industry asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in a bad state and that give a bad image to the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Association of Merchants of the Zona Dorada, recalled that, on different occasions, there were calls to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the roads and pavements had a negative impact, as tourists would go for a walk and see the disorder, and turn their backs on the nearby shops.
“Politicians don ’ t know what it means to have to close a company one day, and they don ’ t worry about how much money you lose. Otherwise, they wouldn ’ t be carrying out the construction slowly and haphazardly. ”
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community has to take its responsibility and avoid doing it again. How to do it? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of fixing everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it needs to be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean living space. The city administration needs to change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito from Mazatlán."
"Nowadays we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. We need to offer a good product, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean and the tourist attractions in good condition," he added.
"Not enough attention has been paid to these precautions and these kinds of incidents expose what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed how important it is to save the tourist sites of Mazatlán, because they are not used properly and create a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that had to be brought into shape together with the city. Making the city clean, neat and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán has many historical and cultural sites that need to be cleaned up to make them attractive for tourism and added to the inventory we use to promote this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business sector is calling for a dignified parliament, free of collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is troubled and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated, made up of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the Partido Nueva Alianza, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergencia, and another of the PVEM, making a total of 40 representatives of the people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do clean work, to feel committed to society and to the different social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the Coordination Council of Entrepreneurs (CCE), suggested that the new MEPs should take the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the members of parliament really exercise their right to act free of collusion between the parties, because it is customary for them to reach agreements with which they represent their own interests, thus transforming themselves into carnival extras of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We see to it that they carry out a trustworthy work and above all that they stand up for the society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in them in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the hotel association Tres Islas, says that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is to drive and work together for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they boost economic growth, create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in some way boost job creation."
With regard to the tourism industry, he called on the new MEPs to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary place in the national budget to promote it.
"I understand that it is the Ministry with the second least resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agribusiness."
Funds must be allocated to tourism projects, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which was not revised in previous legislatures, must be brought up to date.
Holy king is sought
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family long for dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
It will be difficult for the parents to fulfil these wishes on the next Epiphany, because the household consists of no more and no less than twelve people and a male goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth because their father has no steady work.
"Sometimes times are hard because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go out on the street with the brats to sell," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaide would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie Doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo would like to have a 'monster car' for some time and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús Cayetana suggests clothes in the size for one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) told me, 'I would so much like this monster', but I answered him, 'Let's wait, boy', because it was very expensive," Cayetana remembered sadly.
Clothes and shoes would be ideal for the older children who were in school.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has size 12; the ten-year-old Isaías has size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has size 8.
14 year old José Juan is missing tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1 / 2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the 'Holy King is wanted' campaign by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday in the context of the destruction of a production and sales network of cannabis around the ten house searches in the administrative region of Estrie were carried out.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, at the places which are said to have served predominantly the production of drugs.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment used for production have been confiscated," said Louis Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of them from Sherbrooke, who are considered to be the main wire-pullers of the drug ring.
The people arrested are said to have arrived in front of the Sherbrooke Courthouse hours after their arrest.
They could be accused, among other things, of the production of cannabis, of plotting its possession for sale, and of providing services for crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation, which took place for over a year.
"The information received from the public authorities has enabled us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel specified.
Around 70 police officers from the Estria regional investigation unit of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department took part in this police operation.
Clandestine immigration could easily be pursued
The Conservative draft law, which the government says should solve the problem of ships loaded with clandestine immigrants, is likely to be stamped out after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I am standing with a party that has put shackles on your feet," Michael Ignatieff, leader of the Liberals, told the assembled deputies at the end of the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows the detention of any person from a sea-going vessel identified as transporting illegal immigrants for up to a year, violates the Canadian Constitution on Freedom and Rights, as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also hinted that he could not support the bill because it was directed against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government does," said Duceppe.
Criticism of Olivia Chow ’ s immigration issue, the NDP, has dismissed critics who claim that her party is not steadfast enough in dealing with clandestine immigrants.
"Neo-democrats agree to take action against stowaways, and that is what we are trying to enforce through another bill, C-35," Chow said.
We do not support the Conservative bill because it blames the refugees and keeps children in prison for at least a year, "said Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform MEPs that they will not tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and that treat the country like a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take tough action," said Secretary Kennedy.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its bill, which could have led the country to elections that would have rejected the government.
One conservative, however, told the QMI agency that the government would call a vote so that any opposing MP would immediately explain himself to his voters.
The new unity does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest of the possible creation of a new standing unit to combat corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public committee of inquiry on the subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that the idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the slightest, despite the presence of Robert Dutil, at the meeting of the standing committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year.
There was also no lack that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as "a rabbit conjured out of a hat" as well as "a tailor-made solution at the end of a table".
For his part, Minister Dutil had again addressed those who feared that political power would have too much influence over the future unity in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it", he reaffirmed.
"One is aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, President of CSQ, nothing can replace conducting a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only way to set up a committee of inquiry is for Jean Charest to resign," said Yves Boisvert, a lecturer in ethics and political systems at the ENA (State College for the Training of Senior Civil Servants).
In order to get out of this impasse, he proposes to Quebec to give financial audit control a special mandate to investigate corruption and collusion.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit control", he decided.
He also argues that Quebec could give audit control the same power as Commissioners, which would also allow it to oblige people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal code to better anticipate this type of crime.
This demand was made by the Attorney General of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean Marc Fournier, that the case law in this type of prosecution is ambiguous.
For his part, Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, was currently dealing with certain amendments to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps in 2001, which affected motorcycle police groups, 131 people were arrested, although the penal code had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has been raining in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
There was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauritius, on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another landslide took place in the administrative region of the Lanaudiere, in the town of Saint-Lin, Laurentides.
A road has sunk into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall of 40 to 70 millilitres spilled over several regions.
Between 20 to 40 millimeters of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimetres of rain had fallen here.
In addition to these precipitations, snow melting has already accumulated in certain areas, and several watercourses are feared to be crossed.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the floods on the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint Jérôme, in the Laurentine Mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become objects of flood control and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has led to the crossing of several lakes in Sainte Julienne, Sainte Marcelline and Rawdon.
In Saint Calixte, an alternative bridge was torn away due to heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
According to Security Council member Annik Bouchard, the security service remains on alert and is closely monitoring the situation.
On Wednesday, the Quebec National High Water Centre issued warnings of the steep rise of several rivers, notably Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially reprimanded
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Board (CCNR) for his controversial statements about social welfare and Haitians, as well as for his overdue talk about radio.
According to the CCNR, M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their opinions, but certain statements contain "inaccurate information about social welfare and unjustifiably negative representations of the Haitians, as well as such crude language that is not appropriate for daytime broadcasts."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion of suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the broadcasts in 2008 and 2010.
The first injunction was issued following a complaint from the Quebec Social Support Front.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators should provide solid rather than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had argued that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the supervisory board members had drawn the conclusion that the message conveyed here was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the broadcast" Dupont le midi "would have raised a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
As a result, he was not found guilty.
The last point of dispute concerned the statements referring to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Rene Dufort had engaged in a debate on this subject that was effective in the media and provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI ’ s moderator said that he did not donate money to Haiti, because it was not known for certain whether the people in need would receive the money.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect presented an unjustifiably negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already served my three-day suspension sentence on this case."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," said the moderator.
In all resolutions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of crude language.
In all cases, the CHOI ’ s radio announcer acted “beyond his obligations ”.
The consequences for the broadcaster, which was, inter alia, required to communicate its decisions once during prime time broadcasting within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, an Algerian from Montreal, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who excels in "Sanda" (full contact Kung Fu), kickboxing and thai boxing, is now looking for new challenges on the tatami and in the boxing rings of the world.
"I started fighting in Algeria 12 years ago with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing," explained Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
Personally, I look for combat everywhere, because for those who do not like ground combat, as the mixed martial arts present it, competition is rare in North America. "
Recently, the security officer and UPS employee gave bad news to his rivals by winning two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the Amateur World Amateur Championships in Edinburgh, Scotland, between October 23 and 30.
"I won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China."
"Those fighters from each category who had placed among the top four in the last World Cup were invited."
"I babe 2009 fetched bronze in Toronto."
"In 2005 I finished eighth in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating from China, in which punches and kicks as well as floor throws are permitted.
The duels usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxing fighter that has emerged from this kind of martial art is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal were to retain just one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence at the Super-Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest ranking and most respected in China," said the likeable pound boy.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand's largest stadium)."
"It was a super experience."
Zemmal had won his first match in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will each meet in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tendering
Hydro ’ s Quebec office has granted, by mutual agreement, $450 million in contracts to project planners for the Eastmain ’ s 1 A hydropower project, Sarcelle ’ s Rupert.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without tendering.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a by-product of the decision of Hydro-Québec to hand over to the private sector its responsibility for this important hydroelectric project amounting to a sum of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Énergie gérance" consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Québécois Parti, resorting to consortia of companies is a serious ethical problem, which raises the risk of displacement of competition and an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of playing a frame-up game and weakens the competition."
"This means that instead of playing games that have been set up in secret, we are now playing them in an open way," said Sylvain Simard, a member of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, for it seems difficult to him to understand how the public interest could be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon, vehemently denying that the treaty was a frame-up.
"I remain true to my line," she railed, affirming that the PQ had been "dishonest" and "lacking in toughness."
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The consortium model is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in terms of its scope of work.
The construction process is underway and is expected to be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the Treaty was awarded without competition being able to take place; there had already been negotiations.
Moreover, the consortium ’ s model in Quebec is no longer an exception, even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short overflight of the Quebec Register of Companies makes it possible to nominate more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of permanent duration.
In this way, Dessau, for example, works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA +, Génivar, SNC and Lavalin, as well as Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, goes back to one and the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
As regards the "Énergie gérance" consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to particular labour dynamics and that since the 1970s, Hydro-Québec has taken particular account of this fact".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has stuttered its nose at the fact that the project management contract was approved by agreement.
"If you make an announcement and there are only a few applicants, your prizes will skyrocket."
“So you have two possibilities: either you take the people who are on this Mart and tell yourself they will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price. ”
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price that matters, but the people's expertise," Laporte said.
This contract, which has been awarded to the "Énergie gérance" consortium, forms part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Quebec Parti.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro ’ s Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain ’ 1 ’ A ’ Sarcelle ’ Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consultancy contracts awarded to companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
Lavalin had won 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these treaties have been negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the $295 131 564 contract with "Énergie gérance".
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Quebec Liberation Party" were well known.
Minister Normandeau had suggested that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that "financed" it, before specifying that it was their executives.
Barometer Responsible Consumption - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly sceptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the key players in sustainable growth, nor in the labels or eco-labels that are supposed to guide his choice.
It is a pity, despite the fact that it is bathed in a world of media, full of information in favour of more responsible consumption, that the Barometer of Responsible Consumption has to complain about a lack of credible information, an insufficiency which is a brake on its commitment, as the first reading held yesterday showed.
Although they pushed ahead with the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecs still seem to give little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population admits that they really do not believe the environmental commitment of companies or the green corporate advertising, as revealed by the sophisticated measuring instrument devised by the responsible consumer centre of Sherbrooke University.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates added to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
By the same token, only 14.6% of Quebec ’ s population takes political discourse seriously.
Information on responsible consumption nevertheless seems important for stimulating this segment of consumption, which is currently invigorated by approximately one third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, emptiness and the dubious nature of information dampened the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebecs are suspicious of the reported performance of the green products and services they are trying to provide.
According to another communication, more than half of the consumers had already changed their habits in 2010, mainly changing the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the Scoreboard, 61% of them also preferred to buy food from traders in their neighbourhood and to buy food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of the environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of the Quebec loves to present itself as king of the recycling, which tries to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of the animal protection.
However, the social and ecological awareness seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecs have stated that in 2010 they used public transport or preferred the carpooling to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds clichés.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, which belongs to Daniel Langlois, in order to return it to its actual cinematic function, apparently do not receive what they demanded.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a loan of less than the initially expected amount, which could provide a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least according to sources extracted from the state ’ s rumored kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for EUR 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, and since then the request has been revised downwards again.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St. Pierre, who is in charge of the eXcentris file.
Several days ago he sent her a final factual report.
However, the Cabinet's counter-proposal was submitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to respond.
In any case, the premise of state donation really seems to have been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec Community of Owners of cinemas and cinema complexes had opposed direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there that he had not provided to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, cinema director Daniel Langlois had presented the auteur cinema in the premises of his cinema complex with great difficulty for over ten years, which could justify the exceptional position of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep its clientele busy.
Société Angus and Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini at the helm, are in turn heading for a privately financed campaign, from which they are hoping to raise $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
But Christian Yaccarini did not withdraw the newspaper Le Devoir and ignored what he and his group thought of the downgraded proposals made to them.
Mystery of Complex-Shaken Canada Revealed
The new American diplomatic corps, propagated by WikiLeaks, reveal the secret of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians vis-à-vis Americans; but they also reveal the latter ’ s sense of superiority vis-à-vis Canada.
As a result, American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian American relations in mind at the ballot, and they believe that President Obama ’ s visit would have helped the Conservative Government push through its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were distributed publicly yesterday, offer even more piquant details than the mere substantial contents to be nibbled at.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period when the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations ceases to participate in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
Much to the surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador to Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
"An inferiority complex almost inherent to the Canadians may cause Canadian political leaders to speak much more about everyday domestic issues than to blame the United States for this election (as in the 1988 campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to speak of".
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less, since the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
“Logically, ” he says,“ it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to conduct such an essential relationship, which the voter has in mind as a key factor at the ballot box. ”
The other expression of this sense of importance is the communication sent on 22 January 2009 by the Ottawa Chargé d'Affaires, Terry Breese, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure the survival of the government in the vote of confidence in the federal budget in early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade as a result of a $30-40 billion recovery program," Breese said.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition, and that the continued existence of the opposition parties in this way would affect the quality of the proposed recovery programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast by CBC are spreading from the United States.
The Ambassador is disturbed by broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "No effizient fly" list, or even interrogations carried out by musclemen of the CIA.
Another communiqué details how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner, at her first bilateral meeting, whether Europe was prepared to accept certain Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered yes, but on the basis of an individual 'case-by-case' decision.
At the end of the meeting, as he described it, "he handed the Secretary of State a paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has agreed to re-examine the file".
Finally, it should be noted that there is a lot of excitement about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close advisor, had told CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He had spoken here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global lighting renewal plan
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in the greenhouse gas (CFCs), which is almost a third of the additional reduction that must be achieved in order to stabilise the earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its place in the concrete large-scale projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments from developed countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFC emitted by means of lighting, if the incandescent bulbs, which currently constitute a 50 to 70% monopoly on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting accounts for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major exhaust emitters such as the United States, China, Europe, and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans aimed at reducing global CFCs emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, another 5 Gt would have to be deducted from this balance sheet in order to stabilise the 2 ° C rise in the climate between now and 2020 in order to prevent it from spiralling out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs escapes 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with the new LEDs, light bulbs can be reduced by twice as much.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last between 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the Philips manufacturer this week - which incidentally participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, indicating the savings potential of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new types of light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a regulating resistor.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they must therefore be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless producers provide a collection point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power stations, which emit far more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power stations emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would make from this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion annually on electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 coal-fired power plants, which Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election immediately after the deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the necessity of the Independent Electoral Commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," stressed a spokesperson of the UN chief.
"It asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the preliminary results."
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the Electoral Commission missed the deadline set for Wednesday at midnight, three days after Sunday ’ s election, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue with the work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, there were repeated calls from all over the world for the CEI to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo ’ s camp anticipates the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of “fraudulent ” votes in the north obtained by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup d ’ état that failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidential campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, had confirmed that the FN's manoeuvres to intimidate voters in the north of the country had discouraged the President's supporters from going to the polls.
The entire election could be annulled if Gbagbo's complaints are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo ’ s opponents now believe that the country ’ s Supreme Court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N ’ Dré, a politically close associate of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North who denies any connection with the former rebels, has judged the delay in announcing the election results to be 'unacceptable' and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies affirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost; and filing a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the Electoral Commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of Sunday ’ s presidential election was seen as the culmination of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts for years.
The United Nations warned the politicians of the Ivory Coast on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo won the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France stable in third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (ILO), the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the provisional, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee.
The unemployment figure in the metropolis has established itself at 2.631 million.
The data for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% including the departments overseas.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million people were not employed in the French metropolis in the third quarter, but they wished to find a job, including whether they were able to work every two weeks or not and whether they were looking for a job or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points seen within three months, + 0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including the overseas regions.
According to the IAA, 637,000 of the young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the third quarter.
For their part, seniors have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+ 0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 people over the age of 50, and 6.6% in overseas departments.
Only the 25 "49 year olds" had been able to benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, + 0.1 percentage point over a year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a dispute about its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office of Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
An investigation was launched against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches de Rhône Region (PS), and he was taken to Luynes prison, near Aix and Provence, as part of an investigation into the public markets suspected of fraud.
According to his lawyer, Alexandre Guérini was accused of embezzlement, misappropriation of public goods, theft, complicity in corruption, illegal bribery and possession of weapons.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to express himself on all questions that the public prosecutor will ask him, instead of spreading fantasies."
"It is easy to accuse him of a number of criminal charges, but it is another matter to prove them," his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before the hearing of his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first PS (Socialist Party) man in the department, was keen to send the judge a memorandum of justification through his lawyers before his hearing.
A member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill, which he had to manage, running.
According to Simon, he would never have had knowledge of the area of business competence or the destination of the associated funds.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne agglomeration, was also accused on Wednesday of embezzlement and complicity, but then released on condition that he stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts he was accused of."
"The chief prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were charged and released from custody during the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under judicial supervision, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the waste disposal company Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "illegal interference and passive bribery".
Two civil servants from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one for "evasion and misappropriation of common property by a civil servant" and the other for "complicity in the misappropriation of public funds".
The life partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "stealing and embezzlement of social assets".
One of the people who were compared to Guérini was Stéphane Brunengo and Girard, who was recently imprisoned for a similar affair of public fraud that affected Corsica.
The investigators suspected his company of having contributed to laundering money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the disposal branch, will be conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation proceedings.
Nearby investigation sources show that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions for the award and operation of a landfill at La Ciotat, which also relates to waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities in the urban catchment area of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss affair: the Elysée ’ s palace exaggerates its intermediary function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", kept the French public in suspense, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the watchful eye of United States diplomats.
The American documents received from WikiLeaks and reviewed by Le Monde reveal some of the background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how the French authorities tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman did not entail the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France and wanted by the American judiciary for trade in material for Iran ’ s nuclear programme.
Finally, they highlight the way in which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In truth, he had done nothing about it.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French Commentaries on the Way of Handling Hostages".
François Richier, Elysée ’ s strategic advisor, met with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d ’ Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised Americans to do their utmost to repatriate their own nationals, who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulate loud and clear and unceasing" the words "basic human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do this".
For "silence solves nothing", past the attempts to discuss in an inconspicuous way, the Iranians are "masters in evasive manoeuvres".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a 'familiar Iranian tactic': 'taking hostages for political blackmail'.
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (scheduled for 16 August, the day she took refuge in the French embassy) "required the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (bail of 230,000 euros).
And he announces that the Elysée anticipates further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will worsen".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
One piece of information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding because of illegal trade in sensitive electronic materials, has been released from custody following a decision by a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is bad news for Washington, which is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks to acquire the material intended for the nuclear programme.
Did France accept horse-trading?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
At a new meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier asserts that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to rebel against it.
“There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice ” (currently Michele Alliot, Marie), but“ the French government cannot change the judicial decision ”, he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be subject to 'strict' supervision by the French secret service.
The Elysée ’ s advisor dials a telephone number, puts it on again, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian “is currently in the buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy. ”
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make believe, by means of statements and "escape attempts" organized by the media, that Syrian President Bachar al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential mediating role".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and state that the manipulation bears fruit, since several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the media blitz of the French authorities".
What is the basis of so much 'gratitude' to Mr Assad, the Paris embassy wonders.
"Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to fall prey to this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts “aim to confirm Sarkozy ’ s policy of opening up to Syria, ” he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008 that at the time was "perceived by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
"In an edifying way," Paris said, "Paris is trying to show Syria what commendation can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this well.
On August 11, François Richier confided to her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything."
"But in spite of everything we thanked them."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss will return to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes them to the Elysée.
In a communiqué he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot".
No Online Games for Young Koreans After Midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "Cinderella," which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, officials implied.
A bill calling on online gaming operators to ban young people under the age of 16 from playing these games after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, representatives of ministries of education and family affairs reported.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulties with learning at school and also with leading a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, head of the French press agency Agence France Presse, responsible for this draft law.
The online games are then accessible again from 6 clock in the morning.
Manufacturing companies would have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also came up with a plan to ask the manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for access to these games to those youngsters whose parents ask for it, the person in charge added.
He will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of online games worldwide.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals against 58 other nations in the World Cyber Games.
2018 World Cup in 2022: FIFA appoints host country
In an uproar over allegations of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee will appoint the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups on Thursday, a highly political election in which the scramble for influence and lobbying threaten to eclipse the technical criteria.
But one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA ’ s supreme discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a little more exotic; the International Federation hopes to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its debut on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political deployment of a World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes threaten to continue until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA ’ s evaluation report, the English, Spanish, Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so weighty for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could just as well have ruined the chances of their own country, the cradle of football, which was allowed to host the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC once again nurtured this on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report that shells three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
This is reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the British authorities, who have been lobbying intensively with David Cameron over the past few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the successful chess game of his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the organisation of the Olympic Games 2012 for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be enough to restore the image of England before the Committee?
Nothing is less certain, as the duo Spain, Portugal, does not lack trumps with its already completed stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, European Championship 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the two countries ’ economic and financial downsides could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become a weighty outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the unambiguous allusion to the English press's accusations of 'unfair competition in the preparation of the vote' on the part of the members of the Commission.
"You throw mud at them, you try to compromise them," Putin railed.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorites.
First world economic power, seat of FIFA ’ s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very beautiful project.
But these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat is FIFA ’ s eagerly awaited 2026 World Cup approval for China, which will make Asian prospects for 2022 obsolete.
With Australia and Qatar, which had pulled out all the stops by waiting for futuristic stadiums, FIFA is expanding into new areas, but these two countries represent a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weak television rights acknowledged by European countries (due to the time lag), FIFA ’ s delicate nerve.
Second mandate: the obviousness
De Gaulle had really trimmed.
Mitterrand had led people to believe that he was standing still.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
One mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current Head of State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness does not suit the side of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So we have to pretend that the doubt will remain from now on.
In one sense as well as in the other.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac ’ s supporters claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy promised in earnest to take his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011."
The fact that, on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP, he would suggest to parliamentarians the perspective of "two mandates" had thus spread a little feverish.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms to just two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he has mentioned the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me at worst, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
To a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the phase after that."
His words the day before yesterday make him a candidate no more than the day before; nor less.
If they evoke comments, then for a double reason.
Acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the inclusion of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that exhorts many members of the PS to challenge earlier than assumed.
The bad polls on the other hand.
For the first time, voters would prefer François Fillon ’ s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy ’ s (46% versus 44%, according to the BVA ’ s poll on L ’ Express).
“We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP, ” the Prime Minister ’ s entourage reacted immediately and cautiously.
“If he found a defeat possible, he wouldn ’ t be a candidate, ” announces Jean Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has come to terms with the obvious.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB ’ s Governing Council last year should provide an opportunity to explore ways out of the crisis, or at least to announce a large number of unconventional monetary-policy measures that are due to be completed by the end of the year.
The crisis of the European sovereign debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt, without doubt, cannot afford to forfeit also the present, more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to cause their aggravation.
The political cost would be far too high.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role played by the ECB in helping to resolve Europe ’ s fiscal debt.
It has not dared to say whether it believes that the central bank can do more, for example by boosting its bond-buying program.
'I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) '.
The previous day in Brussels, at the hearing held by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had not shown himself to be very eloquent about his intentions, but rather content himself with pointing out that the programme of purchases of government securities on the secondary market would be 'pursued' and that at the meeting on Thursday we will 'see what the decisions are'.
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB doubled the Treasury ’ s bond purchases last week to approximately EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to indiscretions from some dealers, yesterday it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among traders about the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase price (see page 29).
Economists no longer expect a remarkable change of course.
When bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB ’ s arsenal, the latter will grapple generously with its unfettered reserves for a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already preparing to extend this measure by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will amend its programme in any significant way".
"Otherwise, it would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In its interventions in the sovereign debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that revives the sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of European banks ’ exposure to sovereign debt markets in the eurozone, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must, at all costs, put itself at the service of the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent rash enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest states," a major bondholder said yesterday.
If interest rates were to soar, governments would be prevented even more from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
Berlusconi ’ s government hiding in Italy
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a little yesterday with the decline in key interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the President of the Region, Giulio Tremonti, had heard that the situation was "indecipherable" and that he was expecting an "unpredictable" weekend, which the person in question immediately denied.
At any rate, on Tuesday, the gap in German interest rates had reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had risen to 263 points, causing a certain lack of head in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with German interest rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, had expressed his "grave concern" at the "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal, ” says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
To put it plainly, its problem is the absence of economic growth and the accompanying dwindling tax revenues, which put the state at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget submitted to the Senate is 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates that the budget deficit will remain at 4.3% of GDP next year (against the 3.9% projected by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the turmoil surrounding a new budget collective, which could be used for a sum of EUR 7 billion after the holidays.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are in order, we have been doing this for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, which is in charge of Italy at the IMF.
“At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. D. R.), is being asked to make less stabilising progress than other countries, ” observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question remains of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure from the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the early elections could be organised as early as the end of March.
There is therefore an unfavourable period for taking decisions on a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde emphasized it explicitly at a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I believe it was proven on Sunday afternoons and evenings: Europeans are unequivocally united, ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area".
Although completely relative, the deduction recorded yesterday for the interest rates on European sovereign bonds was grist to the mill of governments and the ECB.
However, there is still no sign of a start to normalisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, arguably the most effective target for speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs heavily on the banking systems," say the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, since "the political time passes much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both the gulf and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
Informal discussions between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their counterparts in the G20, are progressing well.
This is also in view of the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan includes the lot of unconventional measures to strengthen the backing of the eurozone countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As for the EU ’ s stability fund, its executive director, Klaus Regling, began his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the ground for it.
The first capital expenditure by the EU Stability Fund is foreseen for next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative had entrusted Reuters with a possible increase in the funds mobilized by the IMF ’ s additional direct involvement.
For their part, Portugal and Spain, in the first place, are preparing to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the area of the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms which, in addition to austerity measures, are expected to have an impact in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are going down a different road than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both sides are anxious to avoid at all costs having to seek international support before they have drawn up their own budget corrections and decided on inevitable structural reforms that will restore their confidence in the long term.
European financiers, for their part, are discussing the options available to accelerate the normalization process of sovereign-debt markets.
Axel Weber, who was in transit in Paris on 24 November, was the first to come up with the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to pick up its own pockets again.
Barclays Capital ’ s economists, the leading player in Europe ’ s sovereign-debt market, say an extension of €100 billion would be enough, “preferably ” in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means exists: the European mechanism of endowed financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has every chance of being carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions become more acute.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in Orange alert
The snowy episodes are still causing traffic problems, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange alert because of the risk of snow and freezing.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in Orange alert; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers hit the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it is snowing slightly on the Ile dele France.
In the departments concerned, snow cover of 2 to 5 cm is expected, in places also from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente "Maritime", Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse "Normandie", Ile "de" France "and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic jams and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp / Lannion and Saint Brieuc / Loudéac corridors.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult according to the traffic police, who advise against using one ’ s own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER touring coaches has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were envisaged for heavy goods vehicles on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "urges motorists to exercise extreme caution on the roads and to adjust their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Roissy airport in Paris and 10% from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfall.
DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airport in South London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Billions have been rained since the debate on the modernisation of transport on the Ile-de-France.
At least in the discussions.
It is worth remembering in particular the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the start of construction of the SGP, the state has announced a capital envelope of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum which would then enable SGP to lend a part of the financial sum in duplicate on the markets.
Today, the first projections have finally been made.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the Finance Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of this money.
There are two types of measure: the creation of a special tax on development and a higher tax on the offices on the Ile-de-France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the bill, goes "in favour of the public corporation Société du Grand Paris".
It says: 'The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year'.
The second is a reorganization of the already existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it, to increase the product resulting from it and to hand over this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A riddle.
This sum is not stated in the text.
From the 4 billion one is far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of capital raised by the State and gradually provided to the Société du Grand Paris for the project", the explanatory statement states.
The SGP does not find this system offensive.
"From the moment you register income (the two taxes, or so it is said), you can cover the project for over three years and only then draw on the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This will be noted in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to price the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which 4 billion promised will be able to be sought for a long time to come, runs the risk of provoking a very lively parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and busy spies
The WikiLeaks Affaire has a dual meaning.
On one side, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal of hypocrisy in the sense that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and gives a foretaste of the regression-dominated future.
But let us proceed one by one.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that every file produced by a secret service (an arbitrary nation x) is composed exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits are nothing more than what has been read for months in every journal (except for those owned by Berlusconi), and Gaddafi's shockingly caricatured profile has long provided cabaret artists with material for their sketches.
The rule according to which secret files can only consist of news that is already known is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not just this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes, le Chateau, the Templars, or the Rosaries) repeats exactly what was written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (nor because he does not know where to find news about the non-existing), but because those who devote themselves to occultism do not believe in anything other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown's mechanism of success.
Likewise the Secret Files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be anything, for example editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department was the same as the one that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why has such a fuss been made about the disclosures of these dossiers?
On one side, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the Heads of Government can call each other or take an aeroplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representational tasks, have turned into espionage centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that this is being done to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the abandonment of hypocrisy and serves to cast American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that any hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the world ’ s most powerful country has a major impact on the state department ’ s prestige.
Furthermore, the scandal is bringing distress not so much to the victims as to the 'executioners'.
But let us look at the profound nature of what happened.
Formerly, in Orwell ’ s time, all power could be pooled like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Since then, Orwell ’ s prophecy could have turned out to be completely correct, where every movement can be controlled thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the motorway chosen and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if we consider what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control corridor ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the avenger of the citizen - can discover the secrets of power.
But how can a power keep itself that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
True, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of Berlusconi ’ s or Merkel ’ s character is basically a secret free of secrets, since it exposes the public sphere; but to reveal, in the style of WikiLeaks, that Hillary Clinton ’ s secrets were empty secrets is to deprive them of any power.
WikiLeaks has done neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this insult inflicted on such a vast power?
It is obvious that the states will no longer put any reserved information online in the future - this would be tantamount to a poster stuck on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with current technologies, it is in vain to hope to keep confidential reports over the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state has moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships be maintained in the future, and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and novelistic, but I feel compelled to imagine the government agents, secretly busily moving along uncontrollable routes, carrying their messages nowhere but in memory, and furthermore hiding the little written information they have received in the heel of their shoes.
The information would be stored in single copies in closed drawers: basically, Watergate ’ s espionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that technology is now progressing like a cancer, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film tape by tape, by being able to wind from the back to the front and reveal all the secrets of the montage, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays allow nothing else but to jump from chapter to chapter, in macroportions.
The high-speed trains run from Rome to Milan within three hours, while it takes three and a half hours by plane, including the transfer.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to the car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At the moment, it is the embassies that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France improves its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine the implementation of the fast-start financing commitments made by developing countries.
And already the coarse French beautifications are revealed.
Under the Copenhagen Accord, developing countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU pulled out all the stops to convince its partners of its commitment to Fast Start funding: detailed process report from its Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and precisely appreciated for its intrinsic value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same thing at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right track to respect its €7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But if you look at the details, things are a little more complicated.
This money should, according to the Copenhagen Treaty, be 'new and additional' in order to ensure that an additional effort was made without being to the detriment of Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what 'new and additional' means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonization, certain member states, including France, blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark he considers best.
For example, the EU ’ s Commission has chosen as a benchmark for 2009: international funding will be maintained, adding €150 million over three years under Fast Start funding.
Other countries have adopted similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or conditions at the level of Official Development Assistance.
In return, France considered that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks for spending in the previous year or at the global level of official development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French assistance to developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about this yet, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, include 1 borrowed €as equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (projects often linked to mitigation, based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro that one collects as the equivalent of a donated euro... Moreover, only the cost of the loan to the donor country should be credited as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking out 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5%) (36.1 million euros) - see also the EU-document to see for yourself.
France is the only EU country that makes significant use of loans.
Germany is asking for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are fulfilling their obligations 100% with donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet its commitments, France gives just 10 cents, which is a similar commitment.
Beautiful hocus-pocus!
All in all, in its Fast Start, France operates with a double swindle: on the one hand with a further development of the action over time and on the other hand with the reality of the financial effort.
France manages to make believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promises, saving EUR 36.1 million.
The manipulation of the Treasury (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a doubly negative effect; on the one hand, the EU (why do the other member states continue with the donation, if it is enough to borrow?) and on the other hand, in the negotiations, since the developing countries cannot be completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing is only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the totality of discussions on climate.
But it could be too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Be that as it may, it is imperative to learn his lesson from this first year of premature financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its accounting method for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France could advance the debate on the issue of long-term financing (another, crucial, and currently debated issue): it does not escape the question of “accountability ” or the accounting nature of its loans.
France could change its position to be as progressive on the issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister, Kosciusko Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France ’ s Fast Start and its vision of “accountability ” and the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base needed for further discussion.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child consumes 81 different chemical substances over the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (former movement for the protection of the rights and respect of coming generations).
The association, which explains that its results "do not represent a statistically significant value in view of the low number of analysed samples, but rather an illustrative character of the problem being treated", had between July and September bought the food usually consumed within four foods consumed at meals by an approximately ten-year-old child, plus a snack in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit pieces, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were examined as well as sweets from laboratories looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is devastating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as potential or probable carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogenic, as well as 37 endocrine disrupting substances, according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if in the approximate totality of the cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded, one understands nevertheless very well from this collection that the reality, in which the consumer is exposed to possibly carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruptors, is alarming", notes the association.
At breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic residues and three safe carcinogenic residues, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as a snack for the study, contains traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including over lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly banned in the EU.
The steak, the canned tuna and even the baguette and chewing gum were also peppered with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the case of tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak was "richest" with 34 chemical residues identified, and even the plastic plate used to heat up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer "is probably underestimated", according to the study.
For its part, the Alliance Europe Ecology "Les Verts" (EE "LV") has proposed, "in view of the urgency of the situation", to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in diseases of civilisation".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
