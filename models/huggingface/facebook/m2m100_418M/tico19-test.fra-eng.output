Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus cases (COVID-19) shows a similar evolution in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, confirming that, although it is at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic progresses rapidly in all countries.
According to Italian experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must prepare for a peak of COVID-19 patients who need care, and in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, an unknown case of pneumonia of etiology was in Wuhan, in the Hubei province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, about 80% of people with COVID-19 have a benign condition, i.e. a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, most of which heal.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 causes a more severe infection that requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develops a severe form of the disease that requires intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we evaluate the evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (R.-U.), and compare it with the evolution of the Hubei province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, the COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world now follow that of this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the March 5 Eurosurveillance 2020 edition, Spiteri et al. the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe according to the WHO’s case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, in the Hubei province, China.
By 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in each of the 30 countries of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (UK) with, between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1 727 deaths, of which 17 750 cases and 1 441 deaths for Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulated number and cumulated incidence of COVID-19 cases
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CEPCM), the number of cases of COVID-19 in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministries of Health, the national and regional health authorities of different countries as well as the WHO, is updated daily at 8:00 p.m.
These data were used to evaluate the evolution of COVID-19 within the EU/EEA and the UK, and to make a comparison with Italy’s experience.
To assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulated incidence to 14 days of cases of COVID-19, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, within each EU/EEA country and in the UK, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compare the cumulative number of cases in each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 p.m. with data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The cumulated 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom has generally followed the incidence of the Hubei province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to grow around 21 February before a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This evolution was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but all the other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
On March 15, at 8:00 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing within the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic progresses at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this despite the fact that the countries are in different stages and there are differences in the responses of the national public health services, potential variations in case definitions as well as differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for the purpose of confirming COVID-19, including for catch tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors from the affected regions of Italy that about 10 percent of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and the media that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or in intensive care services are currently available across the EU/EEA for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (not presented data).
However, it is necessary to carry out a systematic collection in order to complete the current surveillance data that focus on the number of cases and deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 beds in intensive and intermediate care per 100,000 individuals in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios relating to the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with a risk of 90% overcome of the capacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the CEPCM’s COVID-19 risk assessment.
Since cases have so far been aggregated in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and that hospitals and intensive care services generally host a defined regional population, the cases and intensive care bed data should, preferably, be set at Level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Unit Statistics (NUTS 2).
Italy’s experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic progresses rapidly within the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 as well as an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of care, and in particular intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent Fast Risk Assessment of the CEPCM, a quick, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, passing from an enlightenment approach to an alleviation approach, as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not leave enough time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented in advance.
The Fast Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window during which each country will be able to strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Otherwise, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will have to face a peak of patients who need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
As its counterpart, the SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of SRAS cases in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by mouse cells and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SRAS, but it is much more transmissive, and it affects older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article strives to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this growing research topic.
We will address the foundations of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions are still waiting for answers, we hope that this examination will contribute to better understanding and eradication of this serious illness.
The Spring Festival, January 25, 2020, marked forever the Chinese, who were forced to stay closed for the entire duration of the Golden Week as well as for many other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homogeneous to the coronavirus (CoV) which caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) in 2003; therefore it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and rapidly spread throughout China before spreading to 50 other countries around the world.
By 2 March 2020, the virus had caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For the WHO, COVID-19 is the “public enemy number 1”, potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 works on COVID-19 have been published, including in the fields of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020 presenting the sequence of the virus, isolated from several patients.
This review tries to synthesize the progress of research on this new emerging topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SRAS and another coronavirus disease, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that occurred in 2012).
We will also point out what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and will address some still suspensive but still urgent issues.
Coronavirus is traditionally considered as non-mortal pathogens for humans, causing mainly about 15% of common colds.
However, during this century, we have experienced two highly pathogenic coronavirus for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively, before it rapidly spread to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus epidemic in recent history.
As presented in Fig.1.1, pneumonia cases of then unknown origin were first in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic rapidly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it was that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with the interruption of all public transportation.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the starting point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization called the World Health Emergency Epidemic.
At the time of the writing of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China as well as to 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study conducted on 8 866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the 30-65-year-old range.
Nearly half (47.7%) of people infected were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0,31/100,000) than women (0,27/100,000).
COVID-19 was developed in households, mainly in the Hubei province and in the periphery.
The average duration between the appearance of the symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average duration between the occurrence of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (IC to 95%: 3.51-4,05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, which coincides with the massive travel that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44 % (IC at 95 %: 1.10-1,86 %), and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06 % (IC at 95 %: 2.02-4,59 %).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (man), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
The coronavirus is a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing a simple DNA.
They can be classified into four genres, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronavirus known to infect the human belonging to the genres alpha and beta.
The Spike (S) glycoprotein of the pack is linked to the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme and to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, then a membranary merger occurs.
The viral ARN genome is released in the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genome ARN accompanied by enveloped glycoprotein and nucleocapside proteins forms the vesicles containing virions, which then fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta coronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples taken at the site of origin of the epidemic, the Huanan sea fruit market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using electronic microscopy in transmission, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-fine sections of human epithelium in the respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a smaller infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by orph3b as well as a secreted protein coded by orph8.
The orph3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the orph8 does not contain known fields or functional motives.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the complete human ACE2 cryo-ME structure at a 2.9 Å resolution in complex with the B0AT1 amino acid carrier.
They found that the complex, which presented open and closed conformations, was assembled in the form of dimer and that the complex ACE2-B0AT1 could link two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for the crippling of drugs in order to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host
It was established that the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV came from mice and that they were transmitted to man through civets and camelides, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, mouse cells have been advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SRAS coronavirus from mouse cells called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the barrier of species to infect Man remains unknown, and the transmission path is still to be cleared.
Ji, et al., issued the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted from mouse to man by serpents, which would involve a homologated recombination within protein S.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a long-muse mammal feeding mice, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if it is judged by the 99% genetic homology made between a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference between two genoms is a significant difference; therefore, conclusive results should be expected to provide concrete evidence (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
The SARS-CoV-2 could very well possess similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 seems to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation as well as at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75%, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chlorform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is, in general, without immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronavirus, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by its inherent immune system through molecular motivation recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectine receptors, Toll-type (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
By different ways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturing of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the protein N of SARS-CoV can enable the virus to escape immunity responses.
Soon, the adaptative immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce specific virus antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Help T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokins to support defense cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the functions of the T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst scenario, a multivisceral failure, or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a home appearance, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly admitted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3 to 7 days according to a study conducted on the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study conducted on 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days in average, for a range ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, concluded at an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) according to a demography of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the actual duration of the quarantine according to the most precise incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected by, the virus are placed in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may be accompanied or not by other symptoms such as dry cough, swelling, muscle pain, turmoil, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the disease occurred.
In serious cases, patients quickly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of breast radiation anomalies, should be tested for the virus in order to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had fever at 98%, dry cough at 76%, dyspnea at 55% and diarrhea at 3%; 8% of patients needed ventilation assistance.
Similar findings have been in two recent studies on a family and a home that appeared after the transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% needed ventilation assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with a higher MERS mortality compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
As for SRAS, the main symptoms were fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhea (20% to 25%) and throat pain (13% to 25%), and ventilation assistance was needed for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
On February 14, the mortality rate for COVID-19 was 2 percent, with 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
Comparatively, the SRAS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
According to the MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) of 95% of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table1.1.
The above data suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 has a greater spread capacity than the MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV, but that it is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it was for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemic.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or within a meeting or a vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have frequently traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks before the symptoms appear.
However, it has been demonstrated that individuals can be carrier of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks and that recovered patients can be carrier of the virus again, highlighting the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, a lymphopenia with a number of white blood cells &lt; 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes &lt; 1 × 109/L, as well as a high level of aspartate aminotransferase and a viremia were identified in 1 099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had high levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had an increase in C-reactive protein levels and erythrocytal sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the level of D-dimere, a fibrine degradation product present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes decreased gradually.
Breast radiography anomalies are observed in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral inequal shadows or dissolved glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchanges.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease in the surfacing rate and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to swallow and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most worrying breast examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a dequamation of the pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membranes, an interstitial lymphocytic infiltration and the presence of multinucleated synthetic cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA and is similar to that of patients with SRAS and MERS.
ARN detection of SARS-CoV-2 through a chain reaction by polymerase after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of fake negative, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which then was no longer only on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation was observed for the diagnosis of SRAS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol of use of the SHERLOCK technology based on CRISPR technology for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which allows to identify synthetic ARN fragments of SARS-CoV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of sample) using a reactive bandelette in less than an hour, without the need for sophisticated equipment.
It is expected that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality, if its use on clinical samples is conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can only offer support care to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of recovered patients was offered for treatment purposes.
Pharmaceutical companies all work to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat for patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-bit oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary derivation technique used for the treatment of critical heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of the electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of vital organs functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been found that an excessive reaction of the immune system leads to a cytokine shock in patients with SRAS and MERS.
A cytokine shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce the immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and a multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine shocks.
Other immunosuppressant treatments for cytokine shocks include the modulation of the immune response by T cells, the blocking of the cytokines IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF, the JAK inhibition, blinatumomab, the cytokine 4 signal suppressor and the HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SRAS to reduce the severity of inflammatory injury.
However, taking high-dose steroids did not have beneficial effects on severe lungs in patients with SRAS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would lead to serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, which thus significantly affects the prognosis.
However, cautious use of short to moderate dose corticosteroid cycles was recommended for patients with a severe form of COVID-19.
At the time of writing this report, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, the intraveneous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has proved effective in a U.S. patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, the remedivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other simple-brin ARN viruses, including MERS and SRAS.
Gilead has delivered the compound to China to allow a number of tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
Baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirine have also been advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver injury and other adverse effects may occur as a result of combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibodies production
Collecting blood from patients who have cured from a contagious disease in order to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an ancient practice.
In fact, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen.
Anticorps are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was thus extracted from the blood of a group of COVID-19 healed patients and injected to 10 seriously affected patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, in combination with a decrease in the inflammation phenomenon, a decrease in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to be able to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, certain disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can lead to excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a cytokine release syndrome, potentially fatal.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma to treat seriously ill patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate the B cells of recovered patients and to identify the genetic codes coding the relevant antibodies or to seek effective antibodies against the main viral proteins.
This would quickly increase the production of antibodies.
MTC has been used for thousands of years in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects rely largely on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis, put by MTC theories.
Most of the effective components remain little or no known at all as it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the absence of specific effective treatment for COVID-19, MTC is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or remising of a severe form of the disease.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have proved effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best COVID-19 healing rates were observed in provinces in China that used MTC for 87 percent of their patients, including the province of Gansu (63.7 percent), the region of Ningxia (50 percent) and Hunan (50 percent), while the province of Hubei, which used it only at 30% of the COVID-19 patients, has the lowest healing rate (13 percent).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison as many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account for the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study that compared a treatment using only Western medicine (MO) and a combined treatment associating MO and MTC.
It appeared that the time of return to normal body temperature, the time of symptoms disappearance and the duration of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
Even more impressive, the rate of symptoms aggravation (from light to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (7.4% against 46.2%); the mortality rate was also lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (8.8% against 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MTC remains to be clarified through controlled tests carried out on a larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to clarify the effective components of MTC treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as likely or confirmed cases of COVID-19 usually feel a strong concern about this highly contagious and fatal disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience a feeling of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of the infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia induced by corticosteroids, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological discomfort.
In the early times of the SRAS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities were, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, acute confusing state and even suicidal tendencies.
The mandatory search of contacts and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase the anxiety and lead to a certain guilt of patients towards the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to individuals identified as likely cases, to people in contact with these populations, as well as to any other person in trouble.
This psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional applications and electronic equipment to avoid any close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain from containers of infected animals and humans to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
There have been efforts to develop protein-based S vaccines to produce powerful long-term neutralizing antibodies and/or to induce a protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Lively relieved vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SRAS.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of these potential vaccines in elderly and on patterns subject to lethal provocation, as well as their protection against a zoonotic virus infection, remains to be determined, as no clinical study has yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that the SRAS was extinguished 17 years ago and that no new cases have been since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and cases of MERS continue to declare in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Several vaccine strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential goal in order to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the significant time (18 months in average) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronavirus.
As it is a emerging disease, COVID-19 just begins its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without success.
However, like SRAS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most severe cases.
Therefore, establishing a forecast model is essential so that health agencies can prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies conducted so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are the following (Table (Table33):
Age: Age was the main factor for the prognosis of SRAS, and this also seems to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 affects mainly individuals aged 30 to 65, with 47.7% over 50 years, according to a study conducted on 8 866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age of 66 years against 51 years), suggesting the age as a prognostic factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0,31/100,000 against 0,27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injuries and arithmia.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in patients with SRAS.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 can also be linked to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury; it has been advanced as a potential prognostic factor of disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between the CRP rate and severity as well as the COVID-19 forecast was also proposed.
In addition, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also participate in the forecast.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released in case of tissue injury.
They are, therefore, traditionally a mark of heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Breast radiography results and timely progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other elements to determine the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Using steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used in supplementary treatment for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory injury.
Since high-dose corticosteroid intake has been widely used for severe cases of SRAS, many survivors have experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
So, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has led to a large number of exceptional stress cases, patients often experience long quarantine periods, extreme uncertainty as well as the deaths of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological accompaniment and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies done so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of the SRAS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause or cause little symptoms in the first phase of infection, like the coronavirus that causes common colds.
Therefore, people recently infected or in incubation period can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly prevents the control of the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV was considered to be transmitted by seriously ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than the SRAS epidemic.
Important efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of the entire population in order to interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as other sectors in the country, the number of new cases decreases, indicating a slowdown of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and the decrease phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SRAS, will not disappear by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., set a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the removal of the middle nasal cornea and throat of recovered patients, 2 weeks after they left the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode like the flu.
However, encouraging signs have been observed in China with the gradual decrease of new cases, suggesting that implemented strategies would have worked.
According to initial forecasts, Ebola virus was expected to lead to up to a million cases and half a million deaths.
However, thanks to a quarantine and strict isolation, the disease was finally put under control.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 is weakening in terms of infection to eventually disappear or that it evolves into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with Man.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SRAS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by cough or stretching, and also possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus was also identified in seals, thus revealing a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study conducted on 138 patients found that 41% of cases were likely due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the sick, and even any person who may be in contact with patients or people infected.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in the wear of face masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) contributes to controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgery masks prevent the projection of potentially infected drops or their deposit on surfaces, where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only the N95 (1860) masks provide protection against the inhalation of virions of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions able to fully penetrate; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV in size, since both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particles manage to pass through five surgical masks empty on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 (1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals need to wear adjusted insulation shirts to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor found himself infected with SARS-CoV-2 while he was wearing a N95 mask; the virus could have penetrated his body through the eye due to an inflammation.
Therefore, health professionals should also wear transparent sights or protective glasses at the contact of patients.
For the populations of the affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended to wash hands with disinfecting soap more often than usual, to stay restricted to the maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected people.
It is recommended to keep a distance of one meter with the sick.
These measures are effective means of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as on January 7, 2020, must have placed China in high alert state after the SRAS epidemic in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calmed the population by stating that the new virus was less contagious, that it presented a limited interhuman transmission and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a remarkable relief, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
Chinese disease control agencies must learn from it and take the necessary measures.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, because each word counts and can affect the behavior and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to the unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official bodies; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at its beginning rather than to try to calm the population; and (4) make more targeted and relevant exercises to raise the population awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to test and regularly improve the response system of the society.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of the writing of this report, it spread to China as well as to 50 other countries around the world.
Since this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of SRAS, the COVID-19 epidemic makes birth as an impression of already seen.
However, there are noticeable differences between COVID-19 and SRAS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and to treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women; the severity and mortality rates are also higher among older people.
SRAS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% against 1.44%).
COVID-19 virus transmission is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SRAS was mostly transmitted by seriously ill patients; therefore it is much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and much broader than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 DNA detection tests may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be again positive to the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of spread.
Despite the rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several critical questions remain suspended, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between the SARS-CoV-2 and two SRAS coronavirus from mouse cells, this is not enough to conclude with certainty that the SARS-CoV-2 comes from chiropters.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the virus from the initial host, for example the mouse, to man?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt the transmission, and the epidemic can start again at any time.
A molecular modeling and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, but how exactly the virus penetrates the respiratory cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also link to cells expressing ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to determine a quick and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like the SRAS or reappear regularly like the flu?
It is essential, although it may take time, to get answers to all of these questions as well as many others.
However, no matter what expenditure it has to generate, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only few immunodepressed patients had a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The first SRAS case dates back to the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdong in China.
Without counting the super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could approximately generate two secondary cases with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, the peak of viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headaches, fever, discomfort and friction, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, false hepatic function tests and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory tests in case of suspicion of SRAS.
Diffuse alveolar injuries, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SRAS.
About 20 to 30 percent of patients then need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory tract, several organs including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by a cytokine shock, which can be fatal especially in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to the research on HCoV.
The HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, elderly and immunodepressed patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal removal of a 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present throughout the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
The same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in a 71-year-old man hospitalized due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to effectively transmit and maintain in a continuous way in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 cases confirmed.
Clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SRAS and are characterized by acute evolutionary pneumonia.
Unlike SRAS, many patients with MERS also developed acute kidney failure, which is characteristic of MERS compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases in laboratories were with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most fatal viruses known in humans.
Diarrhea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmitted than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been and could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between the SARS-CoV and the four community HCoV (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in seals samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and its sustainable dispersion after transmission to humans will have an influence on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community HCoVs that cause moderate symptoms adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be the survivors of previous HCoV pandemies.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in a sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptative mutations that compensate the host’s restrictive factors.
In this regard, the more the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the more the number of people infected is, the more there is a chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by a quarantine or other measures of infection control.
For many years, the four COVs acquired in the community have circulated within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require animal reservoir.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogenic, have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is not durable.
They must stay and spread in their zoonotic tanks and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
The SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to the SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoV acquired in the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs acquired in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see if it will fully adapt to the human beings and will circulate among them without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of the HCoV, it will be very useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, tanks, intermediaries and amplifiers of the HCoV.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of a HCoV if it houses a nearby ascendant sharing a high homology at the level of the nuclear sequence.
The original virus has often adapted well and is not pathogenic for its host.
Similarly, a tank host houses the HCoV continuously and long-termly.
However, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish a long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, since 80% of the Guangzhou market animals have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate amplifiers cannot be excluded.
These mushrooms are positive to anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and to the genetic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have set the foundation for a new concept that mouse cells are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 is not the immediate parent of the SARS-CoV and that the mouse is not the immediate reservoir host of the SARS-CoV.
That’s why mouse cells cannot be the intermediate tank host of the MERS-CoV.
Additionally, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromadaires were HIV-positive to specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, as well as camels from the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only through the respiratory pathways, but also through the fecal pathway, which also constitutes the main excretion pathway of the mushrooms.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less significant than that that separates the beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
Recombination is a common factor in the evolution of beta-CoVs.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be derived from mouse coV, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 parent viruses were found in worms.
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another mouse coV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelides were also suspected to be intermediate hosts.
When the HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from the pet around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was.
The history of inter species transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs from the HCoV-229E nearby mouse have been found.
First of all, unlike the alpagas, men can have a contact with the mushrooms in a shared ecological niche.
In contrast, humans have close contacts with alpagas.
Then, the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs are numerous and non-pathogenic in the mice, while the alpha-CoV of the alpha caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
In reality, mushrooms are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rage virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that mice can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility, while the mouse alpha-CoVs serve as the genetic tank of the HCoV-229E, alpagas and dromadaires could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the inter-species transmission from mouse cells to dromers and dromers to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV found in mice is known thanks to its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present with dromers for decades.
It adapted well to these camels that have passed from intermediate host to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Unlike the role of the camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolins in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities of inter-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, the mouse can be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to the SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an eco-friendly niche with mouse cells through depeating or coal mines.
Secondly, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifiers hosts to which a SRAS-CoV-2-related virus was recently introduced.
Humans contract the virus by breaking and consuming beef.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species having been both in contact with mouse and pangolins.
Research on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other simple-line ARN viruses, estimated mutation rates of CoVs could be considered “moderate” to “high” with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site, according to the adaptation phase of CoVs to new hosts.
However, the conversion rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the shift rate is often high when the CoVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
It can be assumed that he has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to the SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which has been well adapted to dromers.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic deviation makes vaccines and antivirus against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Thirdly, CoVs randomly and frequently change the model during the replication of the ARN through a unique “selection-copy” mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for CoV observed in animals, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Interaction virus-host related to transmission
Beyond these three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with a host receiver is another key factor influencing the inter-species transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during inter-spesial transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acids substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that the SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor as the SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein unit means that the affinity of this protein S with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates an affinity 10 to 20 times higher than that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine if another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 is also linked to ACE2, but with a different part of protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as Aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silic acid for HCoV-OC43.
The differences in host proteins between humans and natural HCoV reservoirs hosts, such as mushrooms, dromaders and rhinoceros, could constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
The emergence of new HCoVs: Return to the starting box
The diversity of Mouse CoVs offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, Mouse CoVs are genetic reserves of HCoVs.
Among the SARS-CoV additive proteins, ORF8 was considered important in adaptation to humans, since the SARS-CoV-related mouse viruses were isolated but coded divergent ORF8 proteins.
This removal divides the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is presumed as an adaptative mutation that favors host change.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, in most nsp10 and in some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which have occurred in dromadaires in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the HCoV-229E-associated mouse and camel viruses, the alpha-CoV of the alpha presented a simple insertion of nucleotide, causing a breakdown in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exercised in their host tank.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms have been detected when the mushrooms were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between the CoVs and the mushrooms.
It seemed that the mushrooms had been well adapted to the CoVs from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, anomalies in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in mushrooms effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of mouse cells could both suppress the replication of CoV and affect the "relecture" by exoribonuclease, creating selective pressure and giving rise to highly pathogenic viral tribes when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for host adaptation.
So, it’s not a coincidence if three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as mushrooms and camels.
They react solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and what causes cases of severe infection in humans reside.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lungs injury.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was discarded from the replication of CoV.
The same dissociation strategy of the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammatory substance is failure in mushrooms.
Following this reasoning, the inhibition of the inflammatory NLRP3 with MCC950 could be helpful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a mosquito beta-CoV that shares 95% of nuclear homology with the SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a mosquito beta-CoV that shares 96% of nuclear homology with the SARS-CoV-2.
Notoriously similar pangolin beta-CoVs to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs have returned under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromadary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as it has been done on wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurring MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, along with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the CoVs of mouse, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in some regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contacts between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural tanks until an opportunity for infection is present.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in the prevention of the transmission of the animal to man and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonosis is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonosis tanks.
First, if the mouse cells transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances the mouse cells and the pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if the mushrooms play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it would be necessary to determine how humans get in contact with the mushrooms.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with the different species, including men, mice and pangolins.
Whether it’s a mouse, a pangolin or another mammal, it should be able to identify the SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parental viruses observed in their natural hosts.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. the mucous).
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogenic agents (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms likely to cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; prevention of infectious causes of diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections.
Reduction of child mortality during births at home.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, which causes 1.8 million deaths per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia lead to the deaths of 3.5 million children each year.
The washing of hands also protects against impétigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor harmful effect, frequent washing of hands can damage the skin by causing skin drying.
A Danish 2012 study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by squamous skin and sweat, and common among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
The deparasitization twice a year, associated with daily handwashing with soap and daily toothbrushing with a fluored toothbrush, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic materials in the soil, are hardly soluble in the water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
Until now, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants allows to target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant stems are not the fruit of antibacterial soap, these may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the tensioactive and skin protective agent, the most complex formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) serving to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extract).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon's School of Public Health indicated that ordinary savons were as effective as antibacterial savons intended for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not warm enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at the body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot and soap water is more effective than cold and soap water to eliminate natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But unlike popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of hot water does not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or an antiseptic is a non-water hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropylic alcohol or ethanol associated with a thicking agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to get a gel, or with a moisturizer such as glycerin to get a liquid or a moisture for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity.Hands-de-infectants containing at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol effectively eliminate the bacteria.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to well moisturize or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid elimination activity of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate handwashing unless you have water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions can lead to skin drying if the formula is not strengthened by emolithic and/or skin hydrating agents.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emulators to the formula.
As part of clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emolients caused significantly less irritation and skin dry than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticary or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water products do not remove organic substances on the hands, but only disinfect them.
That’s why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since these last remains on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hands desinfectants depends greatly on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based desinfectants.
More recently, the formulas that use benzalkonium chloride showed a lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Sand or soil can be more efficient than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if the soil or sand is contaminated by microorganisms, it risks increasing the spread of diseases instead of barging it.
Like soap, sand is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends sand or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wash your hands with hot or cold water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Smooth a generous amount of soap on the hands by throwing them one against the other, without forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when they use soap than with water alone.
Spray for at least 20 seconds.
The action of frying creates friction, which helps to remove the bacteria from the skin, and frying longer removes more bacteria.
Dry abundantly with current water.
Washing in a stagnant water pool can lead to reinfection of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or open air.
Moist and wet hands are more easily reinfected.The most often forgotten areas are the finger, wrist, spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and scattered nail lakes can host microorganisms.
A hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid having the hands dry; skin drought promotes the appearance of skin injury that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives for washing hands when the water from the rubber and/or soap are not available. For example, flowing water from a hole or hole suspended and broken and/or using sand if necessary, in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as “tipy-taps” and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended crossing with the help of a thread, and a pedal that allows to throw a small amount of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is discussed.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in the toilets.
After washing and drying hands with hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the finger pulp and 254% on the palm.
Air-to-air hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palm by 15%.
After the drying of the hands, the following variations of bacterial counting were observed:
There are many different hand dryers manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant snacks is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that send reminders when the hospital staff forgets to wash their hands.
The medical washing of the hands must last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or ice to make each part of the hands shave and frog.
The hands must be stretched one against the other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the rubber (and open the output door if necessary).
The purpose of handwashing in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“germ”) and prevent their transmission.
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/organic fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash the hands and front arms to the coat, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When washing, it is necessary to avoid that the water on the front arms flows to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of bacteria, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
When it comes to the control of staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of handwashing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there was very little additional benefits to increase the frequency of handwashing beyond 35%.
More research is needed to find out which are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find robinets to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options for building hands washing stations.
However, low hands washing rates can also be caused by strong habits, rather than lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hands washing stations can be included in hands hygiene campaigns that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and child mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness campaign that claims to promote behavioral evolution.After the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of hand washing with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to fetal odors called miasms.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating the “good hand washing techniques” have been placed next to the bricks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The expression “wash your hands” refers to a person’s refusal to assume responsibility or to be a complice of something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had this kind of thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory measures of “purification”, such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.
and all breast pain should be treated in this way, especially in your age
Especially if you have fever.
And your cholesterol and your tension should also be controlled.
Do you have fever right now?

Do you have trouble breathing right now?
Do you have any other symptoms?

This is the season of the flu.
It is also worth noting that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in the genoms of viruses, which are highly likely to be a consequence of the pressure exercised during the selection, by the host’s immune system.
For example, the total loss of ORF4 in the prototype HCoV-229E stake, due to a depletion of two nucleotides, can be mentioned.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the HCoV-229E-associated mouse and camel viruses, the alpha-CoV of the alpha presented a simple insertion of nucleotide, causing a breakdown in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exercised in their host tank.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms have been detected when the mushrooms were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between the CoVs and the mushrooms.
It seemed that the mushrooms had been well adapted to the CoVs from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, anomalies in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in mushrooms effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in mouse cells is suppressed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression rate of the molecules of the major complex of histocompatibility class I.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of mouse cells could both suppress the replication of CoV and affect the "relecture" by exoribonuclease, creating selective pressure and giving rise to highly pathogenic viral tribes when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for host adaptation.
So, it’s not a coincidence if three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as mushrooms and camels.
They react solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and what causes cases of severe infection in humans reside.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lungs injury.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was discarded from the replication of CoV.
The same dissociation strategy of the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is strong in mice.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammatory substance is failure in mushrooms.
Following this reasoning, the inhibition of the inflammatory NLRP3 with MCC950 could be helpful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general scheme through which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a mosquito beta-CoV that shares 95% of nuclear homology with the SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a mosquito beta-CoV that shares 96% of nuclear homology with the SARS-CoV-2.
While cattle and other animals on the market have been discovered as SARS-CoV-like viruses, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified.
Notoriously similar pangolin beta-CoVs to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by humans, whether voluntarily or accidentally.
CoVs have returned under the ramp fire due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in mouse and other animals has greatly changed our perception of the role that zoonotic origins and animal tanks play in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Many factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from the mouse and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Since the SARS-CoV infection comes from the contact between humans and civets present on the markets, the closure of the markets of fresh products and the defeat of civets present there could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
According to the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the markets of fresh products to avoid the transmission of zoonosis, given the discovery of many beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely linked to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, if necessary, how this transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in the following studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromadary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as it has been done on wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurring MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, along with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic coVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the CoVs of mouse, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The opportunities are not missing for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and rebuild, causing the emergence of new more transmissible and/or fatal CoVs in man in the future.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in some regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contacts between humans and animals.
In the face of the damage caused by SRAS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and intervention plan should be established.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural tanks until an opportunity for infection is present.
Although rats have many favourable features for the spread of viruses, the likelihood for humans to be in contact with rats and other wild species can be minimized if people are aware of the need to stay away.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in the prevention of the transmission of the animal to man and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonosis is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonosis tanks.
Not all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of the SRAS-CoV-2 are yet known.
First, if the mouse cells transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances the mouse cells and the pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if the mushrooms play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it would be necessary to determine how humans get in contact with the mushrooms.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with the different species, including men, mice and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it’s a mouse, a pangolin or another mammal, it should be able to identify the SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parental viruses observed in their natural hosts.
Future research in this field will help clarify the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have significant impacts on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for “such cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Fast Recommendation Directive for the Diagnosis and Treatment of the New Coronavirus Infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this Directive described our experience and provided references for fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge progress gradually based on the results of the current studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we answered a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for a “such case” and a “confirmed case” according to the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially carries the name of the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the COVID-19 a pandemic.
To be able to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted much attention since its publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge progress slowly based on the results of current studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) had seven editions in total between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, some of which contexts have been substantially modified.
After our directive received a comment from Zhou et al., the latter presented a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has brought new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We accept their important work and thank you.
However, their work should also be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Test Seventh Version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspected case must associate one of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in neighboring areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been in the last 14 days before the symptoms appear; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighboring areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been in the last 14 days before the symptoms appear; (4) a history of contact with cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighboring areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been in the last 14 days before the symptoms appear;
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) images presenting the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total number of white blood cells indicating a normal, reduced or reduced number of lymphocytes from the beginning of the symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case must be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) real-time positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome with strong homogenity with new known coronavirus; (3) positive serological test for the IgM and IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2; or modification of the specific IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 passing from negative to positive or title increase ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to that of the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood clots was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic screening of blood clots was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continued work of researchers aimed at finding an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for quick diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood collection, with increased availability of different samples, and have contributed to adding the positive result of the specific antibody to the confirmed criteria.
Furthermore, more and more evidence reminds us of caution with regard to atypic symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified people with no clinical symptoms as “low-risk”.
The evaluation system should also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope the emergence of more direct evidence and we ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “such cases” and “confirmed cases”, we suggest them to follow and follow the latest guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive timely to provide assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a daily record
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 in a single day.
The country has recorded a record death rate due to the virus in a single day.
On Wednesday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Monitoring and Research (IEDCR) that the number of infected people registered included 114 active cases and 33 people healed, who remained locked at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The public transport closure began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
Transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was always permitted.
On the 19th of March, the three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeded a million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Worldwide, countries have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's confinement until May 1.
The Parliament of Portugal voted the extension of the state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes for, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially fatal a HCoV infection could be.
The majority of HCoVs come from mushrooms where they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate tank hosts of some HCoV are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
The study of CoV-host interactions in animals could also allow better understanding of CoV in humans.
According to the differences in protein sequences, the CoVs are classified into four genres (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The genres of the Beta-CoVs contain the majority of the HCoVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that mice and rings play the genetic source role for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
At present, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The tracking of the zoonotic origins of the HCoV provides a framework that enables you to understand the natural history, the driving forces and the restrictive factors of crossing the barrier of species.
It can also guide or facilitate the search of the SARS-CoV-2 container, intermediate and amplifier with significant implications in the prevention of future infections.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Over the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the respiratory tract of patients with an infection of the upper respiratory tract in 1966, and then adapted to grow in lung cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E presented symptoms of classic cold, including headaches, stretching, discomfort and throat pain, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
The HCoV-229E and the HCoV-OC43 are both present all over the world and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter, in countries with moderate climate.
Australian shops reduce limit quantities of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian shop chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper to two and one pack per purchase in all stores at the national level, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a limit for a package.
These limits were displayed in the form of messages to the box and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
The buyers apparently gathered reserves because of fear of COVID-19 and the need to confinate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, said that with the restriction of four packages in force, “many stores are still in stock break in the hour following delivery,” and called the request “unprecedented,” while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it “unpredictable.”
Sales saw a “strong increase” last week, according to a spokesman for Woolworths.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the allowed amount to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made available earlier stocks for a scheduled promotion on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make the task difficult.
It predicts an increase in production costs, while suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early shutdown of stocks, some stores are unable to honor the Wednesday promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a distribution expert at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores refuels stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a voluminous item, resulting in stocks of a reduced amount which, once exhausted, leaves large spaces empty in rays, strengthening the impression of a shortage.
“Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [buy] and are available in large amounts, it will probably reduce panic,” Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday they were in stock breakdown.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures the Sorbent paper, stressed that they work 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to the News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, said that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first auctioner at auctions in Melbourne, while less auction sales were organized because buyers were on vacation during the long weekend of the Work Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin-printed daily, included an eight-page encart designed to be cut down and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially refusing to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 ABC Australia report in which they announced they did not intend to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the UK online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 rounds.
World Health Organization calls COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the current COVID-19 epidemic (the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic.
Although the word “pandemia” refers only to the extent of the disease’s spread, and not to the danger of specific cases, the WHO has indicated the need to push governments to action:
“Every country can still change the course of this pandemic.
If the countries screw, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s chief executive.
“We are very concerned, not only by the alarming levels of spread and gravity, but also by the alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said, in a statement published by CNN in February, that “except the flu, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its appearance until its continued spread worldwide.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, saying that “we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.”
He added, “and we’ve never been witness to a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status follows the decision of the WHO in January to declare the epidemic a public health emergency of international scope.
Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, said about the epidemic: “To be short, the situation will worsen.”
On Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a coronavirus disease epidemic that has been ongoing since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are healed.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4 percent in China, while in the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04 percent in Algeria to 0.08 percent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, coughing and drowning.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory disorder syndrome.
The period between exposure and the appearance of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and support therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to cough, staying away from others, as well as monitoring and limiting people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have reacted by setting restrictions on travel, quarantines, firewalls, workplace risk controls and establishment closures.
The pandemic has caused serious socio-economic disturbances globally, the delay or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortcomings aggravated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, touching approximately 99.4 percent of the world’s student population.
False information about the virus has circulated on the Internet, and cases of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, as well as other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to the decrease in travel and closures in the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
The health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the Hubei province) a home of cases of unknown cause pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened early January 2020.
The majority of cases were linked to Huanan’s large-scale seafood market and therefore it is thought that the virus would be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called the SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely linked to the coronavirus of the mouse, the coronavirus of the pangolins, and the SARS-CoV. Then it was discovered that the first known person who presented symptoms was sick on 1 December 2019, and that person had no clear connection with the later home of the fresh product market.
In the cases of the first home in December 2019, the two-thirds proved to have a link to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified South China Morning Post report suggested that the first case could date from November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old person in the Hubei province. On February 26, 2020, the WHO pointed out that, as the new cases seemed to decrease in China but suddenly increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong underestimation of cases, especially among those with beneficial symptoms.
On February 26, relatively few cases had been among young people, those aged 19 and less, representing 2.4 percent of cases in the world. UK chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60 percent of the British population had to be infected before they could effective collective immunity.
The cases indicate the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had for official policies not to test those that showed only beneficial symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that in China, until January 23th, 86% of undetected COVID-19 infections were estimated, and that these undetected infections were the source of infection in 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the cases.
The first estimates of the basic reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are healed.
For those who are not healed, the period between the appearance of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common is 14 days.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to the COVID-19.
In China, on February 5, approximately 80% of deaths concerned people over the age of 60, and 75% suffered from preexisting health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official countings of deaths associated with COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to the dead who have been tested positive to COVID according to official protocols.
The number of real victims of COVID-19 could be much higher, as it may not include untested dead people – for example at home, in retirement houses, etc.
Parcial data from Italy reveal that the numbers of overmortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognised “We know that [the announced number of deaths] is underestimated,” a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of the underestimating in the U.S. Such underestimating often occurs during pandemies, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic The first confirmed death took place in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On February 28, outside China, more than a dozen deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On March 13, more than 40 countries and territories had deaths on all continents except Antarctica.
These figures vary depending on the region and time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time spent since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and above all health.
According to statistics from Johns-Hopkins University, the global death rate was 6.0 percent (97 039/1 617 204) to 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates of the death ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms appeared between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms appeared after 1 February 2020).The other indicators are the mortality rate (death rate), which represents the percentage of diagnosed people who succeed to a disease, and the infection rate (infection rate), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who succeed to a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates that the infection rate for the pandemic in its overall is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of tests on estimates of mortality.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of the Pennsylvania State University said: “Without control, infectious epidemics usually stabilize and then begin to recur when the disease comes to lack of available guests.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment when this will happen.”
Chief Medical Adviser of the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, said that “this could be over by June” if all countries manage to mobilize to follow WHO’s recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine said that the SARS-CoV-2 “will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two.”
According to a study by the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary “until a vaccine is available (in possible 18 months or more)”.
William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University said: “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus—because it’s very easily transmitted—disappears completely” and that it “will be transformed into a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year.”
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (smellness), loss of smell, drought, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headaches, friction, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO says about one in six people are seriously ill and have respiratory difficulties.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies emergency symptoms such as breathing difficulty, persistent pain or breast pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakenings, and the face or lips bleach; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septicemia, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, so the researchers issued recommendations that people who had a close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to eliminate the risk of infection.
Chinese assessments of the ratio of asymptomatic varies from some to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the period between contamination and the appearance of symptoms) oscillates between one and 14 days; it is more often five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimation of the percentage of people carrying COVID-19 who lost the smell was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information about how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly during a close contact and through fine drops produced by coughing, stretching, or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without self-protection can project drops at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted through fine drops that would stay in the air for longer periods, which could be projected by speaking.
Postillons can land in the mouth or nose of other people located next to or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (RCP) can cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and therefore lead to air spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it may be transmitted through the seals, this risk is considered to be low.
The government of China has excluded the possibility of a fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days following the beginning of the symptoms, however, spread may be possible before the symptoms appear and in advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested positive to the disease up to three days before the occurrence of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory, but the asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during the contact search surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that if we don’t know exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others.
Exactly, the virus could be detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after a day on the carton, and after four hours on the copper.
This, however, depends on moisture and temperature.Home animals and other animals have been tested positive to COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities recommend washing hands after touching animals, as after having been in contact with other surfaces that infected people might have touched.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the home of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in related coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically belonging to the genre Betacoronavirus, the subgenre Sarbecovirus (lineage B) associated with two races coming from the mouse.
It is 96% identical to the whole genome of another coronavirus mouse sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the viruses from the pangolins and those from humans.
The comparison of the whole genome has revealed a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between the coronavirus of the pangolins and the SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
Infection by the virus can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of the symptoms, however, the final confirmation is done by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scanner.
A study comparing PCR and scanner in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, since many of its image features coincide with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “the scanner should not be used for screening or as a first-intention test for diagnosing COVID-19.”
WHO has published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by polymerase in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on respiratory or blood removal.
The results are usually available in a few hours or days.
Usually this test is performed on a rhinopharynx extract but a throat extract can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic imaging elements on the radiographs and tomodensitometry (scanner) of people with symptoms include asymmetric depolition glass opacity and absence of pleural scratch.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to the relief with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR-free imaging is limited to accuracy to detect COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of the breast scanners to the PCR and showed that if the image is less accurate for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it to be taken into account as a screening tool in the epidemic areas.
Convolutive networks of neurons based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect viral characteristics in image both on radiographs and scanners.
Prevention strategies for the transmission of the disease include generally having good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or stumbling in a handwash and then throwing the handwash directly into a rubber bag.
It was recommended to those who had already been infected to wear a surgical mask in public.
Many governments have banned or denied all non-essential travel to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in vast areas of the planet.
This means that the virus spreads throughout the communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been infected. It is advised to health professionals who take care of someone who could be infected to take the usual precautions as well as contact precautions, and wear protective glasses. Contact search is an important method so that health authorities can determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments in this regard has raised confidentiality issues, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a statement calling to set limits to this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been launched or proposed on the basis of the volunteer, and from April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive to COVID-19.False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, washing the nose and gargarizing with mouth bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after being in the toilet or when their hands are apparently dirty; before eating; and after swallowing, coughing, or stretching.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended the use of a hand-based alcohol-based disinfectant containing a volume of at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not easily accessible.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (in a minute of exposure to the desinfectant for a surface of stainless steel), including ethanol at 62–71%, isopropanol at 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5%, and iodized povidon at 0.2–7,5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a kindergarten, all rooms such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreen, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by sick people are disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their folded coat or a handful when they’re coughing or stretching, and to throw any handful immediately.
Surgery masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance passed by the postillons projected by speaking, stretching, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions that explain where and when to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Take a mask can reduce people’s tendency to touch their face, which is a major source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene.”
The WHO recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they face a significant risk, for example if they take care of a COVID-19 patient, even though it recognizes that wearing the mask can help people not touch their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their people to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical tissue masks. China has specifically recommended the use of heated medical masks to healthy people, especially in case of proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends to wear a surgical mask in public transportation or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to make facial masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public outlets without mask or other means of covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the wear of the mask to everyone in public places, so that everyone protects himself and protects others.
The Austrian government has ordered anyone entering a supermarket to wear a mask.
Israel has urged all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, has imposed the wear of the mask on passengers of interurban trains and buses on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for every exit, while recommending the manufacture of a craftsmanship mask to those who cannot buy it.
The masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by decreasing contacts between people.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centers.
You can apply the methods of social distancing by staying at home, limiting your travel, avoiding crowds, greeting without contact and keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distancing in the areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum size of the meetings recommended by the U.S. government and health agencies was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the public gathering of more than two people. The elderly and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a weakened immune system experience an increased risk of serious illness and complications. Thus they were invited by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in the areas affected by the epidemic. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health organizations began to replace the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify the objective of reducing physical contacts by preserving them socially, virtually or keeping a distance.
The use of the term “social distancing” led to the belief that a total social isolation should be applied, instead of encouraging people to keep contact with others through other means.
They include the recommendation to have sex only with a person with whom you live, who has no virus or has no symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 positive and those who think they are infected.
Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in the affected areas.
The most strict individual quarantine instructions were given to people from the most risky groups.
People who have been exposed to a patient with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where transmission is very important have been invited to get in quarantine for 14 days from the moment they were able to be exposed for the last time.
The strategies of control of an epidemic are depletion or suppression, and mitigation.
In the early stages of the epidemic, it is intended to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as to introduce other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, the efforts turn to the relief phase: measures are taken to slow this spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.
Relief and relief measures can be taken at the same time.
The elimination requires more extreme measures to inflict the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1.A part of the management of an epidemic of infectious diseases consists in trying to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what is called placing the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overload of health services and saves time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and individual quarantine; public social distancing measures such as shut down schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage the acceptance of such interventions and participation in them; as well as environmental actions such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and localized quarantine missions, and has issued warnings on the movements of infected people.
Singapore has provided financial support to infected people who have been in quarantine, and has imposed heavy fines to those who did not.
Simulations for the United Kingdom and the United States show that relief (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face major challenges.
Optimal relief policies can reduce the demand for health care by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot avoid hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are immersed.
Removal can be preferred, but it must be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this happens first), because otherwise, the transmission rebounds quickly when the measures are released.
Long-term intervention to eradicate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are ongoing, including existing treatments tests.
Taking prescription-free drugs against cold or drinking as well as rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on gravity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be needed.
Using steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO said some “traditional and artisanal remedies” can relieve the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 is described by the WHO as a fundamental response measure to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines to the attention of primary hospitals and healthcare services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, including by dedicating laboratory services to COVID-19 tests, by canceling non-urgent interventions where possible, by separating and isolating patients tested positive to COVID-19, and by strengthening the capacity of intensive care by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are several theories about the place of origin of the first case (called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could date from 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China.
In a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are generally linked to the Huanan sea fruit gross market, which also sold living animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. A home of unknown cause pneumonia was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei province hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a “SRAS-like coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were repressed by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was repressed by his superiors for giving the warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission subsequently published a public opinion on December 31 and informed the WHO.
There were enough cases of an unknown pneumonia to the health authorities of Wuhan to launch an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled about every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and a major rail correspondence site.
On January 20, China almost 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Further official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States surpassed China and Italy by showing the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1,61 million cases were in the world; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 were healed.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted travel and established border controls.
On April 2, 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are subject to a form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people in the world suffered a form of confinement, a figure rising to 2.6 billion two days later — about a third of the world’s population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would date on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a home case of unknown cause pneumonia on December 26, which she informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
The initial genetic tests of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SRAS.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was informed the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan have received a warning for “spending rumors” about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no “evident evidence” of transmission between humans.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping as a “People’s War” to stop the spread of the virus.
In what was described as “the greatest quarantine in human history,” a sanitary cord was announced on January 23 to stop travel from and to Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, touching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other structures in Wuhan, such as congress centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government introduced new measures to end COVID-19 epidemic, including the issue of health statements for travelers and the prolongation of spring holiday holidays.
The universities and schools in the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macao have introduced several measures, especially with regard to schools and universities.

The confinement in India left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily salary) unemployed. The Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian households had experienced a certain type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement imposed in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers submitted an application for temporary unemployment allowance and 1 million British workers submitted an application for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies moved their employees to a government-subsidized partial activity system called Kurzarbeit.
The German part-time work compensation mechanism was adopted by France and the UK.
The art sectors of the spectacle and cultural heritage have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and independent, globally.
Organizations in the art and culture sector have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the state) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists as far as possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and at different degrees, museums, libraries, showrooms and other cultural institutions were closed until a new order and their exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed.
Another recent and accelerated consequences of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sports events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion parades.
The Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which take place in the last week of the Christian Quarter Penitentiary period, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended the elderly Christians to stay at home rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online and live or television while others propose to practice their worship on drive-in.
Like the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome that closed its churches and chapels and the St. Peter Square that was empty of all its Christian pilgrims, other religious institutions also canceled their services and restricted public assemblies in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants to the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the biggest interruption in the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sports events have been either canceled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-20, the 2019-20 England Football Championship, UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The epidemic disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were initially scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be “replanning beyond 2020, but not later than in the summer of 2021”.
This has pushed many players to register online, and many online gaming sites have noticed a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The show world has also been affected, with several music groups having suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as those of Broadway, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in replacement of traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online “festivals” created for artists to produce, broadcast and promote their works.
On the internet, many Internet memes on the coronavirus theme have spread because many prefer humor and distraction over uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 epidemic, prejudices, xenophobia and racism have increased against people of Chinese and Eastern Asia, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hostility incidents have been observed in many countries, in Europe, Eastern Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (although most cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that Chinese deserved the virus or received a justified punishment.
Some African countries have also noticed an increase in anti-Chinese feeling.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei have a discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the inhabitants of the areas affected by the virus.
Following the progression of the epidemic to new sensitive countries, Italians, inhabitants of the first country in Europe to suffer a severe COVID-19 epidemic, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have initially signed petitions aimed at prohibiting Chinese from entering their country in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan made anger on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asian people living in the United Kingdom and the United States have an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus,” a term considered by its critics racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuates between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and students in major Indian cities would have suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus epidemic.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s West Bengal unity, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and “this is why God took his revenge on them.”
The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which calls them “fake.”In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants have been pushed by the pandemic, and foreigners are described as “foreign waste” that should “eliminate”.
Many pay-to-access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers have made available their scientific articles related to the free access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory screening of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for the detection of the virus and the detection of the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus ARN.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only the ARN of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Anticorps detection (serology) can be used both for the diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Anticorps tests reveal how many people have suffered from the disease, including people whose symptoms were too mild to be or asymptomatic.
An accurate rate of disease mortality and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to a limited scan, no country had reliable data about the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect the mortality rates, which are likely to be considerably overestimated in some countries.
Using the reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, including the nasopharyngated scull or the expectoration sample.
The results are usually available in a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test performed from pharyngated shells is reliable only during the first week of the disease.
The virus may then disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people tested during the second week, a sample can also be taken into the deep respiratory tract by aspiration catheter, or a crack (expectoration) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using a reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), and was the basis of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based clinical quality SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the “E” gen shared by all beta-coronavirus, and the RdRp gen specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive the emergency use authorization from the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes their real-time RT-PCR diagnostics device of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories by the International Resource Agency.
Among the previous versions of the test kits, one in three genetic tests obtained unsuccessful results due to defective reactors, as well as a slurry of tests at the Atlanta CDC. Therefore, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only at that time that federal and local laboratories were authorized to start the screening.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use permit.The U.S. commercial laboratories began the testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests nationally on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. The collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Centre for Research in Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On March 12, 2020 it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed an infection detection test at COVID-19.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the FDA authorization for a test that could be done in large amounts in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use permit (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received a FDA EEA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses the isothermic acid amplification technology instead of the PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that is specifically linked to the new coronavirus nucleocapside protein (N protein) is being developed in Taiwan, hoping that it can deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes, as a quick flu test.
A March 2020 bibliographic study concluded that “pulmonary radiography has a low diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of TDM [tomodensitometrics] can be conclusive even before the appearance of symptoms.”
Among the typical symptoms visible on TDM are multi-lobary bilateral depolished glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric and post-distribution.
A subpleural predominance, a crazy paving and a consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to TDM in Wuhan, the starting point of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, several of its imaging results coincide with other pneumonia and diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “TDM should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”In March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to the infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from approximately 7 days after the appearance of symptoms, to determine immunity and as part of population monitoring.Tests can be carried out in central laboratories (TLC) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
The high-speed automated systems of many clinical laboratories are able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, only one peripheral blood sample is usually used, although serial samples can be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, only one blood sample is usually taken by skin ponction.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction step is required before the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that had properly informed the agency and which, therefore, can now distribute their antibodies screening tests.
By April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use permit.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorizations for their test sets, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral ARN PCR test.
The antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the beginning of the infection.In the beginning of April, the UK found that none of the antibodies test kits purchased by the country were effective enough to be used.
Hong Kong has set up a plan in which suspects can stay at home, “the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube,” the patients crack inside, send it back and later receive the test result.The British NHS has announced that it is conducting a pilot project aimed at testing suspects at home, which eliminates the risk that a patient will not infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the framework of the COVID-19 drive-test for suspects, a health professional takes a sample taking appropriate precautions.
In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Doctors said on 2 March that it had the capacity to perform about 12,000 tests per day in an ambulatory environment, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are covered by the health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, drive tests were available in several major cities.
By March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only the positive results are.
A first laboratory study found that in the calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483 295 samples were tested until the week 12/2020 included and that 33 491 samples (6.9%) obtained a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analysis of samples of 64 patients at the same time, grouping the samples and conducting the screening only if the combined sample is positive.
Thanks to its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modeling revealed that cases in the province of Hubei would have been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost of quarantine would have doubled without this capacity of screening.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities in total.
By March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Multiplexed free models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1,122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests.
In March, the shortages and insufficient amounts of reactive have become a crackdown for mass testing in the EU, the UK and the United States.
This situation pushed some authors to examine samples preparation protocols that involve heating the samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the ARN genoms in order to continue the screening.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now the country testing most of its population per capita for the Coronavirus, and were ongoing to intensify the screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were achieved through a combination of the ability to conduct drive-tests and the purchase of a population-scale broadband laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their emergency detection laboratories “Huo-Yan” in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to carry out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside of China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula to produce kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources needed to develop their own kits.
The protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was published only on January 28, delaying the availability of tests in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of the test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations of the test from health specialists.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The screening capacity, largely in the private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over the years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of screening programs as the best way to slow down the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and the reserves of sculls and chemical reactors were exhausted.
In March 2020, China problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented "defects."The government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that blocked private tests.Spain bought the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but it was found that the results were not reliable.
The company explained that the wrong results could be linked to the inability to collect samples or correctly use the kits.
The Spanish ministry said it will remove the kits that gave wrong results, and will replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic provided false results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested to throw them into the Danube. Ateş Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a “high error rate” and that it didn’t “use” them. The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced early April 2020 that they were unusable.
The screening, followed by the quarantine of those who obtained a positive result and the tracking of people who were in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Voi, the place of the first deaths related to COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the total population of approximately 3,400 people, at an interval of about ten days.
Nearly half of the people who obtained a positive result had no symptoms, and all the cases found were put into quarantine.
With the restriction of traffic in the municipality, this measure has completely eliminated the new infections.
Thanks to aggressive contact tracking, entering travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much faster than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail stores.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began to advise residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened at the scheduled date for the end of the holidays on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracking, entrance travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that the countries that performed the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more capable of detecting people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries without analysis capacity and whose national laboratories have only a limited experience of COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the WHO’s 16 reference laboratories to perform confirmation tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column “Positive in % tests” depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests that people are hospitalized will have a positive percentage of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other factors are the same.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, corresponds to the fact that hands are cleaned to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
The fact of systematically washing your hands with soap at some key moments of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by orophetal.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. the mucous).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key moments of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's neck or changing its layers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
If you don’t have water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands with sand. The World Health Organization recommends that you wash your hands:
Before, during and after the preparation of meals.
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing the layers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after you have swallowed or swallowed;
after touching an animal, animal food or animal waste;
Hygiene of the hands in the medical environment refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medications or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogenic agents (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms likely to cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; prevention of infectious causes of diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections.
Reduction of child mortality during births at home.
According to a 2013 study, improving hands hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by 50%.
The implementation of actions to promote handwashing could reduce the episodes of diarrhea by about one-third, a figure comparable to that obtained by drinking water supplies to low-income regions.
Washing hands with soap reduces diarrhea episodes by 48% and is the most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (IRA).
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, which causes 1.8 million deaths per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia lead to the deaths of 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, getting used to washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce almost half the deaths due to diarrhea and a quarter the deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually associated with other sanitary measures within the framework of water, sanitation and hygiene programs (WASH).
The washing of hands also protects against impétigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor harmful effect, frequent washing of hands can damage the skin by causing skin drying.
A Danish 2012 study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by squamous skin and sweat, and common among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilets (miction, defecation), after cleaning a baby's hips (or changing its layers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
It is also advisable to wash your hands properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after treating a cutting or injury, after stretching, coughing or mocking, after touching animal waste or manipulating animals and after touching waste.
In many countries, the rate of hand cleaning with soap is low.
According to a 2015 study of 54 countries and hand hygiene, 38.7 percent of households in average washed their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that it was in Saudi Arabia that the rate was highest (97 percent), the United States was in the middle of the table (77 percent) and China showed the lowest rate (23 percent). Today there are several methods aimed at changing behavior and democratizing the use of soap for hand washing at key moments of the day.
For example, the Ministry of Education of the Philippines has implemented a “Primary Health Care Program” to promote children’s health and education.
The deparasitization twice a year, associated with daily handwashing with soap and daily toothbrushing with a fluored toothbrush, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate the microorganisms on the skin, it is advisable to add soap or detergents to the water.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic materials in the soil, are hardly soluble in the water.
However, adequate water flow facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria are washed with the mushroom.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that “automatic distributors of liquid soap are preferable.”
Antibacterial soap has been highly recommended to people concerned about their health.
Until now, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants allows to target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which many organs are resistant to.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant stems are not the fruit of antibacterial soap, these may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the tensioactive and skin protective agent, the most complex formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) serving to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extract).A rigorous analysis of the University of Oregon's School of Public Health indicated that ordinary savons were as effective as antibacterial savons intended for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not warm enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria multiply much faster at the body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot and soap water is more effective than cold and soap water to eliminate natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But unlike popular belief, scientific studies have revealed that the use of hot water does not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or an antiseptic is a non-water hand hygiene product.
At the end of the 1990s and early the 21st century, non-water-alcohol-based hand hygiene products (currently called hydroalcoholic solutions, hand antiseptic solutions or hand disinfectants) began to popularise.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropylic alcohol or ethanol associated with a thicking agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to get a gel, or with a moisturizer such as glycerin to get a liquid or a moisture for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity.Hands-de-infectants containing at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol effectively eliminate the bacteria.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after the application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logs) of bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after the application.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to well moisturize or cover both hands.
It is advisable to border the palm and back of both hands as well as the interstities between the fingers and nails for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, mouse or gel drops.
It is also advisable to clean the fingers by throwing them, palm against palm.The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing instead of using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when the hands are apparently dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid elimination activity of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate handwashing unless you have water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions can lead to skin drying if the formula is not strengthened by emolithic and/or skin hydrating agents.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emulators to the formula.
As part of clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emolients caused significantly less irritation and skin dry than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticary or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions have less tendency to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than handwashing with water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water products do not remove organic substances on the hands, but only disinfect them.
That’s why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since these last remains on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hands desinfectants depends greatly on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based desinfectants.
More recently, the formulas that use benzalkonium chloride showed a lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many are those who don’t have the means to buy soap, and who rather use sand or soil.
Sand or soil can be more efficient than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if the soil or sand is contaminated by microorganisms, it risks increasing the spread of diseases instead of barging it.
Like soap, sand is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends sand or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends to wash your hands properly to prevent the transmission of diseases by following the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot or cold water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Smooth a generous amount of soap on the hands by throwing them one against the other, without forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when they use soap than with water alone.
Spray for at least 20 seconds.
The action of frying creates friction, which helps to remove the bacteria from the skin, and frying longer removes more bacteria.
Dry abundantly with current water.
Washing in a stagnant water pool can lead to reinfection of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or open air.
Moist and wet hands are more easily reinfected.The most often forgotten areas are the finger, wrist, spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and scattered nail lakes can host microorganisms.
A hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid having the hands dry; skin drought promotes the appearance of skin injury that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives for washing hands when the water from the rubber and/or soap are not available. For example, flowing water from a hole or hole suspended and broken and/or using sand if necessary, in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as “tipy-taps” and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended crossing with the help of a thread, and a pedal that allows to throw a small amount of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is discussed.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in the toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London) to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-air dryers and more modern air jet dryers.
After washing and drying hands with hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the finger pulp and 254% on the palm.
Air-to-air hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palm by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by 76% on the finger pulp and up to 77% on the palms.The scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential of cross-contamination with the other toilet users and the toilet environment depending on each drying method.
The air-to-air hand dryer, which breathes out of the air at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to expel microorganisms from the hands and the device and possibly contaminate other toilets users as well as the toilet environment in a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer allows to spread microorganisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 meters from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After the drying of the hands, the following variations of bacterial counting were observed:
There are many different hand dryers manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant snacks is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing in a medical environment became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that send reminders when the hospital staff forgets to wash their hands.
A study found that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
The medical washing of the hands must last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or ice to make each part of the hands shave and frog.
The hands must be stretched one against the other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a hairbrush to remove them.
Since the bacteria present in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to wash well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the rubber (and open the output door if necessary).
This prevents reinfection of the hands at the contact of the surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“germ”) and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, properly washing hands and following other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure to follow for washing and spraying hands in the field of health.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines established by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect the comments of the Internet users.
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby et al.
The devices available in commerce can measure and certificate hand hygiene, if compliance with the regulations is proved.
The World Health Organization defines “Five indications” for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/organic fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
The fact of adding antiseptic chemicals to the soap (sapons "medical" or "antimicrobial") provides the hand washing agent with an action of destroying the germs.
It is desirable to remove these germs before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very widespread. To "frot" the hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a rubber that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, a washing product based on chlorhexidine or iodine, sterile towels to dry the hands after washing them, a sterile brush to frot and another sterile instrument to clean under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash the hands and front arms to the coat, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to spray your hands for 10 minutes.
When washing, it is necessary to avoid that the water on the front arms flows to the hands.
Once the hands are washed, it is advisable to dry the hands with the help of a sterile laundry and infiltrate a surgical casque.
In order to reduce the spread of bacteria, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
When it comes to the control of staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of handwashing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there was very little additional benefits to increase the frequency of handwashing beyond 35%.
If you compare hand washing done with a regular soap to that done with an antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, by comparing hand washing with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, it is found that the first reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce the influenza A (H1N1) virus and Clostridium difficult spores present on the hands. In order to improve the hygiene of the hands in healthcare facilities, it is possible to train staff to wash hands, to put more alcohol-based products at its disposal and to send it written and verbal reminders about it.
More research is needed to find out which are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered a cheap and essential tool to preserve health and even properly feed.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to get to establish universal hands hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find robinets to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options for building hands washing stations.
However, low hands washing rates can also be caused by strong habits, rather than lack of soap or water.
Promoting handwashing with soap and conducting awareness activities in this regard can influence political decisions, make known the benefits of this practice and lead to a long-term behavior change within the population.
In order to this, monitoring and evaluation activities are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective in increasing the handwashing rate in low and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. As regards the promotion of handwashing in schools, one can cite the example of the UNICEF's "Three Star Approach", which encourages schools to take simple and cheap measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hands washing stations can be included in hands hygiene campaigns that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and child mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness campaign that claims to promote behavioral evolution.After the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-efficiency ratio of handwashing in developing countries compared to the number of years of healthy living earned (i.e. DALY avoided).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of hand washing with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, especially for people with vulnerabilities such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British “founder of modern nursing care.”
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to fetal odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, food-based epidemics and nosocomial infections led the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an essential means to prevent the spread of infections.
The appearance of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating the “good hand washing techniques” have been placed next to the bricks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The expression “wash your hands” refers to a person’s refusal to assume responsibility or to be a complice of something.
It comes from a Bible verse of Matthew in which Ponce Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Lady Macbeth tries to wash her hands compulsively to try to clean an imaginary spot, symbol of her bad consciousness in view of the crimes she has committed and that she has incited her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after remembering to have committed acts contrary to ethics or having considered to do so, tend to wash their hands more often than others and to give more value to hand washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had this kind of thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory measures of “purification”, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe handwashing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, which consists of using water rather than soap to wash hands, is part of handwashing rituals promoted in many religions, including Bahá’u’lláh and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual handwashing (Netilat Yadayim) in Judaism, washing in Christianity and wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe handwashing for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.
COVID-19 Risk Controls at Workplace
COVID-19 risk controls on the workplace designate the implementation of health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The adequate risk controls at the workplace vary depending on the workplace and tasks, based on an assessment of the risks from exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to a COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with lower risk of exposure have a minimal professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic preventive measures against infection are recommended, including handwashing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing label andining a routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Occupations with average exposure risk include those who require frequent or close contacts with persons without COVID-19 suspected or known, but who may be infected due to a current Community transmission or an international journey.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, in schools, working environments with a high density of population and certain retail environments with a large volume.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly efficient air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of individual protection equipment in case of encounter with a person with COVID-19.
The OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to people with a COVID-19 suspected or known as having a high risk of exposure, going to a very high risk if they carry out procedures producing aerosols or taking or manipulating samples of people with a COVID-19 suspected or known.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers shall include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemics can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they’ve got sick, need to take care of other people or fear possible exposure.
Commercial models may change, both in terms of the goods requested and the means of purchasing them (including making their races outside the high-end hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipping of items from geographical regions severely affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. A preparation and response plan for infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account the risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, family and community-related risk factors and the individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also draw up the necessary controls to cope with these risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemics.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for responding to an epidemic include reducing the transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications,ining commercial operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located affects the answers applied.
The risk control hierarchy forms a framework generally used in health and safety at work in order to group risk controls by efficiency.
When the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally individual protection equipment.
Technical controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on workers’ behavior.
Administrative controls are changes in work policies or procedures that require action from the worker or the employer.
Individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of EPAs must be selected according to the risk for the worker, properly adapted according to needs (e.g., respiratory masks), properly and systematically worn, regularly inspected,ined and replaced according to needs, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or removed in order to avoid any contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with lower exposure risk have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and careful handwashing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing labels, including covering their mouth and nose to hurt and stretch, providing powders and rubbishes, preparing for telework or scaled working hours if necessary, dissuading workers from using the tools and equipment of others andining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Fast identification and isolation of potentially infectious people are a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others on a workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the U.S. recommends employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease to stay at home until they have no fever, fever signs or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of feces or other symptomatic drugs. They also advise to apply flexible disease holidays policies, allow employees to stay at home to take care of a sick family member and inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs with average exposure risk include those who require a frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1,8 m), of people without COVID-19 suspected or known, but who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to a current Community transmission around the company’s headquarters or because the person has recently made an international journey into a region with a widespread transmission of COVID-19.
This includes facular workers in contact with the general public, in schools, high-density working environments and certain high-risk retail environments. Technical controls for this group and high-risk ones include the installation of highly efficient air filters, the increase in ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as a high-risk and high-risk plastic hygiene windows and high-risk connectors that can be protected from transparent plastic and high-risk protection, the installation of high-risk working environments and high-risk working environments. Administrative controls for this group and high-risk retail environments include the encouragement of sick workers to stay at home, the installation of high-risk air filters, the installation of high-risk exposure, the installation of high-risk exposure, the installation of high-risk exposure, the installation of high-risk exposure, the installation of high-risk exposure and high-risk exposure.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls sick on board a plane, the appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: to separate the sick from others at a distance of 6 feet, to designate a crew member to take care of the sick and to offer a protective mask to the sick or to ask him to cover his mouth and nose with the help of handbags when he hurt or hurt.
The cabin crew must wear throwable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching organic fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional individual protection equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or breathing difficulties.
The gloves and other throwable items must be deposited in a bag for dangerous biological waste and the contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected later. For commercial navigation, including cruise boats and other passenger boats, risk controls include delay of the journey in case of illness as well as self-isolation and immediate information from the medical center on board if a fever or other symptoms develop once on board.
For school and child care institutions, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of community spread.
In the event of minimum to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational leaves, assemblies and other important meetings such as physical or choral education courses or cantine meals, by increasing the space between offices, scaling the arrival and departure hours, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate nurse for children with flu symptoms.
In case of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, a prolongation of school holidays can be considered. For the lawmakers who perform daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDCs.
Police officers who have to get in touch with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulance, including carrying adequate individual protection equipment.
In case of close contact during an arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt before re-use with a household cleansing spray and follow the standard procedures for confining and removing the EPI used as well as confining and washing the clothes.
OSHA considers certain health and funeral workers as belonging to categories with high or very high exposure risk.
High exposure risk jobs include healthcare, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers with a very high risk of exposure if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or manipulation of patients with COVID-19 suspected or known.
Procedures that produce aerosols include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure funeral jobs include workers involved in the preparation of bodies of people with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of their death; they pass to a very high risk of exposure if they do an autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include insulation rooms for patients with COVID-19 suspected or known, including when performing procedures producing aerosols.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation can be suitable in certain sanitary and funeral environments.
The samples must be handled using biological safety precautions of level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms depending on the suspicion of COVID-19.In addition to other EPI, the OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people who work less than 6 feet from patients with a suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 respiratory filtration masks approved by NIOSH or higher must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide greater protection and better comfort for the worker.The WHO does not recommend combinations because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic fluids.
The WHO recommends the use of a surgical mask only by the inspection staff at the entrance point.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take care or carry COVID-19 patients in the absence of procedures producing aerosols, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or a facial screen, a shirt and gloves.
In the case of aerosol-producing procedure, the surgical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
Since the global supply of EPI is insufficient, the WHO recommends to limit the need for EPI through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, to limit access to a local occupied by a COVID-19 patient to people directly involved in his care, the use of the EPI necessary for the specific task only, the continuous use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, the monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of the EPI and the dissuasion of the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

Objective: [Covid-19] Relieve the burden and prepare for the future
Date/Time of Delivery: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC

We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the kind of global community empathy, cooperation and strengthening that is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and kindness we have observed among all our colleagues in emails, calls and instant conversations are a remarkable testimony of the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I could not be more grateful and proud to count you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone told me their gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at this time, and the strong symbol represents the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to everyone.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain the operating sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the security of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a moment when not only what we do, but also how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make significant adjustments to the way we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and time jobs
As Robyn mentioned above, the team-c met last night to discuss our approach and our time use in the coming days and months.
During this conversation, we considered what we think would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
First of all, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take back, don’t worry.
All employees, contractors and subcontractors:
Our goal of daily working time will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until a new order.
We do not declare holidays: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you will be helpful in the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at this time, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, to run or to consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We do not monitor your hours.
If you are sick, don’t work.
It should go without saying, but we say it.
No disease stop or paid leave is required: just warn your senior and help your team review timetables and jobs to make sure the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive with COVID-19, please notify Bryan of the T&amp;C Ops department so that T&amp;C will help you and make sure your situation receives the necessary attention from the management).
The staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and we repeat our commitment to honour our responsibilities towards our subcontractors and our time staff members.
Everyone will be remunerated on the basis of their usual working hours performed under normal conditions.
This applies if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to evacuate their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Again, the goal is to protect you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior, so that we know what we expect and can take the necessary measures.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are a few things we have to continue to do.
The SRE, Ops RH, Trust & Security and Fundraising teams (including others) are doing an essential job that may need strengthening.
We will initiate a process with all departments to evaluate current objectives and focus on supporting the key tasks for our mission.
There’s enough work for each of us, we’ll just focus on the most indispensable projects.
Slowing now will not hurt later.
We do not intend to “work twice more to catch the lost time” when the pandemic will pass.
We will not ask you to do extra hours to comply with unrealistic deadlines now.
We acknowledge that the circumstances have changed, and we will endeavour to set new goals and deadlines if necessary.
What about the App (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and the objectives of daily working time, we plan to adjust the deadline for the delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to set up a budget so that employees can focus on essential work, take care of themselves and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their working hours reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of the deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Council next week and will inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as confirmation is made.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Location, exposure and office cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our San Francisco-based colleagues might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, by excess of caution, we called for an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-quality antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own protocol of diligence duty that uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return to it.
Our office in Washington D.C. is located in a WeWork site, which has shared with us and all the Washington D.C. staff members its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our office in Washington DC has adopted a completely remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco’s advice.
As some of our New York-based colleagues know, we also discussed the idea of renting a house in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work on a distance for the first time.
Our colleagues used to distance work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and wanted to give you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to sessions of a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider distributing them over several days.
Defining the meeting clearly, have a agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make videos the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or make a collective note).
Send an email to the technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your well-being refund for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about work distribution
The HR operations team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support increased work distribution in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all the recipients of the Community subsidy to cancel public events funded by Wikipedia, such as edit-a-thons, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed subsidy activities and that no one would be punished in case of delay or change of these goals.
The next week, we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other topical and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness in the face of the turmoil and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
For the next, the CRT is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communication with them.
Stay in contact despite problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation on your calendar for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this time to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
So far, you can always find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and collect all the information in the same place.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff members residing in countries that are currently seriously affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a significant workflow or covering difficulties, or if you need help for anything else, do not hesitate to warn and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and ensure the connection if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of Global International HR Operations.
None of these changes should be considered as an abandonment of our work and our obligations.
It is, on the contrary, to acknowledge that at this time, our work and our obligations will likely have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These steps are those we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to bring to our movement the help it needs, and to offer the world the service on which everyone can rely.
Our planned work will be there to wait for the time to come.
For now, it’s time to help each other and prepare for the important work that will come in the weeks and the months to come.
We need each of you to this, so you must protect yourself and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourself the time comes.
Please wash your hands and don’t touch your face.
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme linked to the external face (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 against the activity of the angiotensin conversion enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7) making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the entry point in the cells of certain coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin Conversion Enzyme 2 is a metal enzyme containing zinc located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a M2 termination peptidase field and a C termination renal amino acid carrier collector field.
ACE2 is a single-passing membrane protein type I, whose enzymatic active field is exposed to the surface of the lungs and other tissue cells.
The extracellular area of ACE2 is clinged from the transmembranary area by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is connected to the cell membrane mainly of the lungs alveols type II cells, gray intestinal enterocytes, blood and vein endothelial cells, and blood cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of ACE2's ARNm is also present in the brain cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain thrust.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
The ACE divides the angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II vasoconstrictor.
ACE2 divides the carboxyl termination phenylamine amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyse into vasodilatatory angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also clive several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinine, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membranary circulation of the SLC6A19 neutral amino acid carrier and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembranary protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in the cells of certain coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV (the virus that originates the SRAS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that originates the COVID-19).
More specifically, the link of spicule S1 protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme area of ACE2 on the surface of the cells results in endocytosis and in the translocation of both the virus and the enzyme in the endosomes located inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the start of S protein by host serum protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of the latter is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to think that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help fight against infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended to continue standard treatment using ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and a meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the subjects witnessed.”
Furthermore, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a higher risk of pneumonia, victims of stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less likely than for the overall risk of pneumonia.”
The human recombinant angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (rhACE2) is presumed as an innovative treatment for severe lung injury and seems to improve lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory disorder triggered by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the time of action is 30 minutes plus the duration of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising drug for people intolerant to traditional renine-angiotensin system inhibitors (SRAs) or for diseases with high angiotensin II circulation.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracking of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of persons (“contactes”) likely to have entered into contact with an infected person.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in certain territories and in certain jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contacts tracking applications.
These systems, especially those that rely on tracking the geographical location of applications users, raise issues regarding privacy.
There are other less intrusive options, including using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration in their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature that supports these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has deployed in China an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people carrying COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has, in turn, chosen for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local community of computer scientists, it has been delivered in open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched “StopKorona!”, a Bluetooth app that ensures exposure tracking to potentially infected people and communicates quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said that the contact tracking application was in an advanced development stage and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are planning to deploy applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geotherapy application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and residing in Moscow, in order to ensure that they don’t leave their home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, mentioned several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positive and potential lack of efficiency if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple only authorizes “official” or generally trusted bodies to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have expressed concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications in mass monitoring, in particular the possible dismantling of the monitoring infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have published a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have set eight conditions to be met in the framework of government projects:
the monitoring should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
extension of control and surveillance should include extinction clauses;
the use of the data should be limited to the objectives of fighting COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity should be protected in a clear manner.
Digital surveillance should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization is avoided.
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
protection against abuse and appeals for citizens in case of abuse should be provided;
The "significant participation" of all "related stakeholders" would be mandatory, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups.The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of the persistence of monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from the operating system of their devices as soon as it will no longer be needed.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, the network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems based on central servers need access to personal location data; several systems have been created in such a way that central servers can only be used for intercommunication, which allows privacy to be respected (see section below).
In South Korea, a system not based on an application has been used for contact tracking.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking data from mobile devices and card transactions, which they then associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to the use of this information to warn potential contacts, the government also made the location information accessible to the public, which was permitted as a result of profound changes to information privacy laws after the MERS epidemic that affected the country.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites. countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized systems that preserve privacy.
The details were not yet announced on April 6, 2020.
The tracking of privacy contacts is a well-established concept, backed by a large volume of research data since 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on privacy solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, previously called Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols make it possible to ensure that identifiable personal data never leaves the device and that all correspondence is carried out on the device.
The MIT Media Lab’s Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform that uses privacy techniques when collecting and using location or contact data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the white book “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” published in March 2020.Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, a company developing privacy technologies originally founded at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising their privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure the global interoperability of tracking and warning applications, an essential factor in their adoption by the broad public.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, stating that it would help preserve privacy and associate Bluetooth Low Energy technology with a privacy-guarded cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
implementing tools that enable governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that respect privacy
Direct integration of this feature in iOS and Android. Google and Apple intend to solve the problems of adoption of the solution and persistence of monitoring by initially distributing the system through operating system updates and later removing it in the same way once the threat is removed.
The reposition of a drug (also called reorientation, reprofilation, reaffectation or change of the therapeutic indication of a drug) means the reconversion of an approved drug for a disease or for a different medical condition than that for which it was originally developed.
It is a scientific research axis currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other research axes include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the plasma transfusion of recovering people. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 therapeutic targeted proteins, each of which has several ligand bonding sites.
The analysis of these linking sites provides the realistic project of developing an effective antiviral drug against the COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papayan type protease, ARN-dependent ARN polymerase, helicase, protein S and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their pre-clinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chlorokin is an anti-paludene drug also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chlorokine and related hydroxychlorokine would be one of the four drugs studied in the clinical trial Solidarity.
The New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the New York State tests on chlorokin and hydroxychlorokin would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychlorokin sulfate and chlorokin phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s clinical trial process and is permitted under the UAE only as experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that “the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquin for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection” is not yet established.
The doctors indicated to use this medicine “when there is no other option.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorokin in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
More extensive studies are ongoing at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquin.
Chinese clinical trials conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average period of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients suffering from pneumonia, half received favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence for the drug is thin and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug in Japan for its reserves and that it would use the army to deliver the drug to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened possibilities for the Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to reproduce.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an antiviral association of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that “no benefit was observed.”
These drugs have been designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by linking to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado tries to modify these medications to find a compound that would link to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There are criticisms in the scientific community regarding the use of resources for the reposition of medications specially designed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity test.
Gilead Sciences then discovered that the remedium had an antiviral activity in vitro against several filovirus, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause a more severe disease and transmission.
A number of clinical trials are underway, two of which are conducted by the University Hospitals in Cleveland; one concerns people with a moderate pathology and the other concerns those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The State of New York began tests on the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Center for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) provides for a clinical trial on Teijin’s alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhalation corticosteroid used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of enzyme conversion of angiotensin 2, a phase II test is ongoing with 200 patients to recruit among the severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with moderate symptoms of COVID-19.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who have been diagnosed positive to COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective contraception method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian drug agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients and studies of the use of sodium enoxaparine in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SRAS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese directives
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese directives
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Tests are also ongoing in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed the clinical tests, many development attempts are ongoing.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said no vaccine was expected against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing phase I safety study.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic has been declared worldwide in 2020, generating significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genoms to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Defined in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists indicated that 10 different technological platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets for phase I security studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and ARN) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
As CEPI scientists said in April, 115 vaccine candidates in total are in the early stages of development, 78 (79 according to Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed in planning or design).
A phase I-II test carries out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, placebo-controlled and performed in several centers all, determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including a witness group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in the prevention of the disease, while monitoring the adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development vaccines (confirmed early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human-personal evaluation phase (always in “preclinical” research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular pince vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced that it began working on a vaccine, whose human testing is expected to start in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28, 2020.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they began working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen develops an oral vaccine in collaboration with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen Laboratory in Romania published a document on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that of the neoantigene vaccination used for the treatment of cancer.
On March 25, the director of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and they were starting the tests.
On February 27, 2020, a Generex subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it started a vaccine project with the aim of creating a peptide-based Ii-Key vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans “in 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its project for the development of a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both located west of Maryland, announced working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced its association with Novavax Inc.
The development and production of a vaccine.
The partners also announced pre-clinical testing projects and a phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in accelerated procedure, it would take about a year and a half to two to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, Quebec, announced to develop a coronavirus-like particle thanks to partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is under laboratory research and human tests are scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian announced that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “strong amounts of money to benefit from exclusive access to the vaccine against COVID-19”, which triggered the German government’s protest.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an ARNm-based vaccine.
The ARNm BNT162 vaccine candidate is currently in pre-clinical testing phase with the beginning of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it would have pre-clinical test results in April 2020 and that the test on the man of its final vaccine candidate could begin in autumn.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in a consortium for the search for a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of the CEPI in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to $29 million.
The other CEPI’s investment partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started testing on animals of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at the Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplificating ARN vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of sending the sequence by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced the grant of a funding of $275 million for 96 medical countermeasures research projects against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Approximately at the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $192 million C dedicated to the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 with projects to create a national “vaccin bank” containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus epidemics occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine indicated testing PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, claiming that “the subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine administered by microwave triggered a significant response of the specific antigen antibodies [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization.”
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
With the help of bacteriophages, the DNA will be designed to replicate into human bacteria to produce inoffensive particles similar to viral particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities shared their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with cloud-hosted IT resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is scheduled to include 4,170 health professionals.
The vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicate the need to implement level 3 biosecurity confining measures for the handling of living viruses, and an international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SRAS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no healing or protective vaccine against SRAS that has demonstrated both its safety and effectiveness in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SRAS were a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing research on SRAS could serve as a model for developing vaccines and medications against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were ongoing; all vaccines were viral vector, two adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks have broadcast a conspiracy theory that the virus that originated COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus tribes such as the SRAS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing and drowning.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The period between exposure and the appearance of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
While most cases generate moderate symptoms, some evolve to viral pneumonia and a failure of several organs.
On April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were worldwide in 210 countries and territories, causing more than 153,000 deaths.
The virus spreads mainly during close contact, often by drops produced by coughing, stretching or speaking.
Since these drops are produced at the end, they usually fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk on long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then by touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the appearance of the symptoms, although infection is possible before the appearance of the symptoms and during the subsequent stages of the disease. The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by polymerase in real time (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their careers.
Recommendations on the use of the masks by the public are generally different, some authorities do not recommend their use, others recommend their use, and others impose their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of the WHO’s six regions.
People infected with the virus can be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, drought.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and a blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less often, higher respiratory symptoms such as stretching, nasal flow or throat pain can be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in different proportions.
Some cases in China initially showed only breast pressure and palpitations.
In some, the disease can cause pneumonia, failure of several organs and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can go up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do this within 11.5 days of infection. reports indicate that not all people infected will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Expectoration and saliva can both carry significant viral loads.
Speaking loud releases more drops than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without being protected can project drops at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not transported by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors placed in the corridor outside the patient’s rooms produced positive samples to the viral ARN.
Certain medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary intubation and resuscitation (RCP) can disperse respiratory secretions and thus lead to air spread.
Although there are concerns about a spread through the seals, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread may be possible before the symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that if we don’t know exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others.
Exactly, the virus could be detected after one day on the carton, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and after four hours on 99% copper.
This varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap-based products degrade the protection lipid layer of the virus, which deactivates it and removes it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia associated with the home case of Wuhan's acute respiratory disease.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronavirus in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the domestic soap, which breaks its protective cover. The SARS-CoV-2 is a close parent of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cells through the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme which is the most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called “spicule” (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and penetrate the host cell.
Acute heart injuries have been in 12% of people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, and are more common when the disease is more severe.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systemic inflammatory response and disorders of the immune system during the progression of the disease, however acute myocardial injuries can also be linked to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the heart functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in the intensive care unit with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with a disadvantage forecast. COVID-19 deaths autopsy showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
It is the secretive T cells of GM-CSF that have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and the severe lung pathology of patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytal infiltrations were also during the autopsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngate removal; however, a nasal removal or expectoration can also be used.
Usually, the results are available in a few hours, or even up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however, they require two blood clots taken at a two-week interval and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a breed of the coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to independently develop chain polymerization reaction tests (PCRs) to detect the infection by the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibodies tests (possible to detect active infections and a person’s previous infection) were in development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience of the test revealed a precision of only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the U.S. approved the first test closest to the patient on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan University Hospital in Wuhan suggest methods for the detection of infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobary bilateral depolial glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric and post-distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Dominance under pleural, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickness with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation can appear with the progression of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleuresis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of gravity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytal hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and the formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffus alveolar damage (DAD) with diffus alveolar exudates.
ADD is the cause of acute respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxemia.
Curing pneumonia: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and interstitial lung fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leuco-erytroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequently washing your hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handy when it is hurt or ethered and using the inside of the coat in the absence of a handy.
Correct hand hygiene after coughing or stretching is recommended.
The CDC recommended to cover the face using a tissue in public places, in order to limit the transmission in case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing the movements and canceling significant groups of people.
Distance guidelines also include a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between persons.
There is no known medicine to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 as early as possible, a key element of COVID-19 management is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called “plate the curve”.
The CDC also recommends individuals to wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in the toilet or when their hands are apparently dirty; before eating; and after swallowing, coughing, or stretching.
It also recommends the use of a hand-based alcohol-based disinfectant solution containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is “not an antiseptic active substance for hands.”
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
People are treated by support care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and support of other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of being viruses wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analyzed.
Personal hygiene, a lifestyle and a healthy diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments may be useful in those with moderate symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized people for COVID-19.
Rehabilitating doctors and pneumologists in the United States have gathered therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020 there will be no specific treatment for COVID-19.
As for symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen in the first line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in care conditions when the implementation of the procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health professionals careing people suffering from COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an air-based insulation room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and air-based transmission precautions. the CDC emphasizes the guidelines on the use of individual protection equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE clothes, facial or respiratory masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks are preferred (to face masks).
The N95 respiratory masks are approved in industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unnoticed uses.
When the masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or ultimately, artisanal masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence suggests that intubation can be avoided by using a broadband nasal canal or a positive double-level respiratory pressure.
It is unclear whether either or both generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a broadband nasal canal. Serious cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years old, and especially those over 80 years old).
Many developed countries don’t have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the healthcare system’s ability to treat a sudden peak of the number of COVID-19 cases serious enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices that provide pressure control modes and a high PEEP are needed to optimize oxygen release and minimize the risk of lungs injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments to start in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are subject to clinical trials.
It seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines may not be developed before 2021, several testing drugs are already approved in other indications and the tests are already advanced.
An antiviral drug can be tried in people suffering from a severe disease.
The WHO recommended volunteers to participate in tests on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary permission to the plasma of recovering people as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the necessary clinical trials to prove its safety and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID.
The app is able to detect “nate contacts” using monitoring data and thus detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app does not only recommend self-quarantine, it also warns local health authorities. Massive data analysis of mobile phones, face recognition technology, mobile phones location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to locate the mobile phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measure was aimed at respecting the quarantine and protecting people who could have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated telephone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile operators that “40% of people continue to move.”
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global call to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People can suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor saying, "Augmented social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm the mental health and well-being of people."
The disease may have a moderate evolution with little or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as cold.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection according to data from similar viruses, such as SRAS and MERS, however data for COVID-19 is lacking.
In the most seriously affected cases, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to develop to an acute respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include septicemia, coagulation disorders and heart, kidney and liver injuries.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in the prothrombine time, were described in 6% of cases hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal insufficiency observed in 4% of people in this group.
About 20 to 30 percent of people with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which passed in hospital.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average period of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a early case study, the average duration between the beginning of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range ranging from six to 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8% while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological tests of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in the pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs is similar to an acute respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of the deaths by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart injuries due to high troponin levels or a heart attack were observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had preexisting pathologies.The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic conditions of a region can also have an impact on mortality.
The estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The subnumber of moderate cases may lead to a survaluation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously agreed cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and were 2.4 times more likely to go to intensive care or die than non-smokers.
The hospital administration in Hong Kong observed a 20% to 30% decrease in respiratory capacity in some people healed from the disease, and lung scanners suggest organic injury.
This can also lead to a post-intensive care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether a previous infection had a long-term effective immunity in people healed from the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, based on the behavior of other coronavirus, but cases of COVID-19 healed people followed by coronavirus positive tests at a later date were.
These cases are considered as an exacerbation of a latent infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and animal by spread of the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost solely led by a transmission from man to man.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the earliest date of symptoms appeared dates back to 1 December 2019.
WHO official publications indicate the first appearance of the symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are usually used to assess mortality.
These figures vary depending on the region and time, and are influenced by the test volume, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time spent since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, gender and health status.
At the end of 2019, the WHO affected the emergency pathological codes CIM-10 U07.1 for laboratory confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 deaths without laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to statistics from the Johns-Hopkins University, the global death/case ratio was 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) to 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the infectious mortality rate (IRF) that reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can indicate how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1,7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, causing a relatively low mortality rate, and all deaths associated with COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
The German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people can have antibodies, according to a blood donor assessment.
69 deaths (0,004 percent of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different in men and women.
The mortality rate is higher in humans in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is the highest in men of fifty years old, the difference between men and women disappears only at the age of 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% in men and 1.7% in women.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be part of it.
Immunological differences according to gender, lower prevalence of smoking in women and the development of comorbidities in men such as hypertension at a less advanced age than in women could have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men and 72% of the deaths from COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government will not collect data related to the type of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health staff, especially nursing staff, are women and have an increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be “COVID-19”.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), an animal species or a group of people, in accordance with the international nomenclature recommendations aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 responsible virus” in its public communication.
The disease and the virus are both commonly called coronavirus.
During the initial epidemic in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were often called “coronavirus” and “Wuhan coronavirus”.
In January 2020, the WHO recommended the use of the provisional 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV names for viruses and diseases, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of places in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limits of the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print the care equipment such as sculptures and respiratory parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respiratory valve and the supplier could not supply it in time, a local startup re-designed and printed the 100 required valves in a night.
After the initial COVID-19 epidemic, conspiracy theories, false information and disinformation about the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to some other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, cows and chickens.
No medication or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “SOLIDARITY test” to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE 2 receiver to penetrate into human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being researched.
First, the researchers are trying to create an entire viral vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to cause a rapid immune response from the human body in case of new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, the sub-unity vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that awareness the immune system of certain sub-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these research focuses on spiculous S protein that helps the virus infiltrate into the receptor of the ACE 2 enzyme.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid-based vaccines (ADN or ARN vaccination, a new technique of vaccination creation).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an innocent genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease.The antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven studies have evaluated already approved treatments against malaria, including four studies on hydroxychlorokin or chlorokin.
Recovered antiviral drugs are the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials on remediation in several countries whose reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines candidates and drugs was also in place in April 2020.A number of existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in COVID-19 treatment, including remdesivir, chlorokin and hydroxychlorokin, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Provisional data suggests the effectiveness of rebounding in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with compassionate remediation.
Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in the United States, China and Italy. Chlorokin, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some require an independent analysis of the research work.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chlorokin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of a gram, indicates that the double of this dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychlorokin and chlorokin under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19.The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for the continuation of an in vivo study after showing a low-concentrated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicule protein that starts using serin-transmembranary protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies on chlorokin and hydroxychlorokin with or without azithromycin have major limits that prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without additional studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine shock can be a complication in subsequent stages of severe COVID-19.
There are evidence that hydroxychloroquin may have cytokinic anti-shock properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was carried out.
It is undergoing non-randomed Phase 2 test at national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with a severe form of the disease.
Associated with a serum ferritin blood test to identify the cytokine shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to be the cause of the death of some people affected.
The interleukine-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of the cytokine refractory to steroid relargation syndrome caused by a different cause, the CAR T cell treatment, in 2017.
Until now, there is no randomized and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems from people healed from COVID-19 to people in need is being studied as a non-vaccination method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for the SRAS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action through which passive antibody treatment can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cell-dependent anticorps cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
Serum production from recovering people, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of healed patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndrome
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the central hospital in Wuhan, who later contracted COVID-19 and died after attracting attention to the spread of the virus.
