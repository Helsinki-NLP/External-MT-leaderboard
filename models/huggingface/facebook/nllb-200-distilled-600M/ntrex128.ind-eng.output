Welsh MPs are worried about their looks being like muppets' dolls.
There has been concern among some AMs over a suggestion that their designations should be changed to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to the existence of a plan to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum are worried that it might provoke ridicule.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned, the call was made by the senate with the Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means dirt.
One assemblyman (AM) said that his group as a unit, felt unhappy and had proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open-minded" to the name change, but judged it was a shortening of MWP to Muppet.
In this context the letter w in Welsh is pronounced like the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any explanation of the designation for the AMs is of course a matter for the members themselves.
The 2017 Welsh Government decision gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on a proposal known to have gained wide support to call the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the designation of AMs, the Commission prefers WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option gains the most support in public consultation.
The AMs seem to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could turn the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on the changes within weeks.
This reform bill will include changes -- other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualifying members and drafting committee systems.
The AMs will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss the bill.
Macedonian people go to vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
The voters will decide whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The famous vote was held in an effort to settle a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour shows a recognition of its territory and has repeatedly rejected offers of membership in the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, an opponent of the name change vote, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is a price to be paid for joining the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's were not ringing when the churches in Harlem were in trouble.
Historically, the old folks I spoke to said there used to be a bar and a church on every corner, Mr. Adam said.
Today, none of them.
He said that the disappearance of all the bars could be detected.
"People are socializing in other ways now", he said.
The bar is no longer a community living room where people visit it regularly.
Likewise with the church, he was worried that the proceeds from the sale of assets would not last as long as the leaders expected, and sooner or later they would be back again from the beginning.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not help maintain the remaining shrines around them.
The majority of people who will buy condos in these buildings are white people, he said,and therefore will speed up the day when these churches close simultaneously because it is unlikely that people who move into these condos will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
The black congregation that had been worshiping in the surrounding area had taken over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused severe damage to the building, but when Parishioners Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild it, they built the bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, Son of Reverend Johnson and his successor at St. Martin proudly called the bell tower the "Poor People's Bell".
An expert who rings the bell to the tower in July gives it another name: A cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
An expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the world's first bell tower played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind who switched to ringing the larger bell tower at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complex architectural and contractor's story, some brought by lay church leaders, and others brought by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the bishop's governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote a letter to the bishopric in July with concerns that the bishopric was seeking to charge fees to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency from the diocese.
Sharks injured a 13-year-old in a lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived to catch lobsters in California during the lobster season opening ceremony, an official said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy crying out for help and then rowed in groups to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a rush of excitement after catching a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!
His entire tendon was torn, Hammel said he realized it when he had already held the child.
I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: There's a shark in the water! Hammel added.
The child was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was treated in critical condition.
The species of sharks responsible for the attack is unknown.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a week earlier, but it was categorized as a harmless species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper body.
Authorities have blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles realized that there are over 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them were considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plan to break the English beauty market
Sainsbury took over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with toaster-style beauty kiosks run by specialist assistants.
As part of the substantial boost to the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow as sales of fashion products and household appliances decline, larger beauty kiosks will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more stores next year if proven to be successful.
Investments in beauty became a hunting ground for supermarkets to utilize shelves that were once used as TV, microwave, and household appliances.
Sainsbury said that would double the size of beauty offerings to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing brands range starting from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas like those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched its boutique makeup lineup so that most of its products would be vegan-friendly - something that is increasingly sought after by young shoppers.
In addition, fragrance shop will test concession at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying daily necessities in small quantities at local grocery stores mean that supermarkets must do more to entice people to visit.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, has said that the stalls will look more like the Mall as supermarket chains try to fight back oppressors like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and no-food service.
Sainsbury has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat outlets since they bought both franchises two years ago, which he says has supported the sale of everyday groceries and made the acquisition more profitable.
Previous efforts by the supermarket to renovate the beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury tried a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to split profits from the chemical store in the supermarket.
A new strategy emerged after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmacy businesses to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical franchise, for £125 million, three years ago.
It is reported that Lloyds will play a role in the plan, adding a range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the look and feel of the beauty kiosks to improve the atmosphere for the sake of our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brands are designed to fit all needs, an enticing environment and a convenient location signify that we are now an enticing destination that challenges the old ways of shopping.
Peter Jones is on the run after Holly Willoughby pulled out of the £11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left with a spell on his hands after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million lifestyle business deal to focus more on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to manage their household appliances and accessories trademark, Truly.
The couple's business is likened to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning host used her Instagram account to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons star Petes Jones angry by withdrawing at the last minute, from their profitable branded lifestyle business - to focus on her larger contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources claim that Jones was so overwhelmed when the TV girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote herself to their household appliance and accessories brand, Truly.
Their business has been likened to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune by £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his vacation homes,
One source says: "Truly by far Holly's top priority.
It was going to be his long-term future, which would make him last for decades to come.
His decision to withdraw left everyone involved in the attack shocked.
No one can believe what happened that Tuesday, so close to launch time.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready to sell.
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most expensive stars, could cost the company millions of dollars because of the massive investment in product forms, from pillows and candles to clothing and home furnishings, and the potential for further delays.
And this could mean the end of a longstanding friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin has been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that we're not going to comment on this business relationship.
We talked seriously and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would get from the news media for making comments that some people consider to be "unpresidential" and has been very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mocking voice, "The news reader is mine".
I'm not giving up anything.
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting a second time after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a step forward for the denuclearization of North Korea.
But denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see any appropriate response from the United States to the initial disarmament movement.
Instead, he noted, the United States continued sanctions aimed at keeping pressure.
Trump is more optimistic in his speech sequence.
"We're doing our best with North Korea", he said.
If we go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will surely be killed.
Now that we have this amazing relationship,
He said his success in repairing ties with Kim has brought positive results - halting rocket tests, helping free hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but rather than having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy an Island, Killing Hundreds
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population lost their homes, there was no national disaster declaration, as a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so this is a bit challenging", Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff will be able to work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute to providing assistance.
Given the ongoing earthquakes that Indonesia is experiencing, the country is still very unprepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
The absence of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although the danger warning has already been issued, has likely contributed to the death toll.
At best, traveling between many Indonesian islands is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A flood hospital that has been deployed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made repairs to damaged Indonesian infrastructure as the core of his election campaign, and he has spent money on highways and railway construction.
But the lack of funds has disrupted Mr Joko's government as he faces re-election next year.
Mr Joko also faces pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Muslim and Christian mobs fought in the streets, using spears, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the winning goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by one score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal as his team fell 1-0.
He put the ball on his left side before kicking it towards the far pole.
The ball bounces high above the goal as the ball bounces to the right corner of the net.
The ball eventually fell past the Arrizabalaga Kepa who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and take one chance and not think too much about it, and just kick.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the first half after Belgian forward Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue forward gave feedback to Mateo Kovacic on the game, before turning near the midfield and running fast into Liverpool's centre.
Kovacic quickly gave the ball and ran in the midfield.
He then made a perfect kick, leading Hazard into goal.
Hazard managed to pass the opposing defender and kick the ball into the corner of the goal with a left foot kick, passing Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the ruins of buildings destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered a 20-foot wave, Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the agency, said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, is filled with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, for murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John Street, at 7:55 a.m. with multiple stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked anyone in the area who saw or heard anything to come face to face.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I would ask anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may be recording something on the dashboard camera to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt confident they knew the woman came to the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police have said, they are in the process of informing the victim's immediate family.
A taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews had just returned to his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
The man can't say anything when he knows what's going on.
Now the citizens are being told that it will take a few hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer was reportedly telling someone that all areas are now being treated as crime scenes.
A woman showed up at the scene crying.
He always repeats this, it's really horrible.
At 2 p.m. two police vans were in line and the other one was outside.
A number of officers lined up to monitor the apartment block.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCc, phone 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 by quoting log 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell Parliament Statue was the last monument to be subjected to a history rewrite.
His expulsion would be poetic justice for the Taliban's destruction of many of Britain's cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical Puritans.
But the Cromwell community described Mr. Crick's advice as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate over the destruction of the statues, that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will be the target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong descendants of Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's remarkable representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in his case of course the kingdom.
Whether it is a fully accurate representation is still the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century had shaped the development of the next nation, and Cromwell was an individually recognizable figure who represented one side of that difference.
His success as Lord Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
The Slayer Pig Harassed the Chinese Farmer to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeastern China, local media reports said.
The man, identified only by his maiden name Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery, streamed with blood near a pigsty in the Liupanshui regional market of Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject a vaccine into pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly went with his cousin from the neighboring region of Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pig tails at the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the door of the nearby pigsty open.
He said that in the pigsty there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
Forensic research confirms that the 550-pound male pig has tortured the farmer to death, according to reports.
"My cousin's bed is bleeding and crumbling", said the cousin known by the nickname "Wu", as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pigs had been locked up to prevent them from attacking others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have also occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig trapped a Welsh farmer in his tractor until his wife panicked and drove the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the smell of blood can act as a trigger.
They're just playing.
They're biters, very curious... they won't come out to hurt you.
You just have to give him enough respect, he said.
The remnants of the storm Rosa brought heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
After all, Rosa will cause flooding throughout the northern Mexican and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa has winds of 85 mph, Category 1 hurricanes, beginning at 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is likely moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Plung began to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward, toward the U.S. West Coast, as Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began to push tropical moisture northward to the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain across parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching trenches will create heavy rainfall that spreads across the Southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour at some points, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
A total of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected to fall in some parts of the Southwest, particularly in much of Arizona.
Floods are likely to occur with conditions deteriorating rapidly due to the nature of the widespread tropical rainfall.
It is highly recommended not to explore the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall can cause the chasm to become a violent river and storms will bring strong local winds and dust.
The approaching pits will cause local heavy rainfall to some of the coastline of Southern California.
Total rainfall of more than half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and roads to become slippery.
It will be the first rainfall in the region in their rainy season.
Some of the scattered tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, before rainfall becomes more extensive on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some great temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic temperature changes within a short distance.
There were accurate examples of dramatic temperature differences throughout the central United States on Sunday.
There's a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will form and spread again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. regions are expected to start warming starting in October with speeds spreading as high as 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show a high chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through mid-October.
Over 20 million people have watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people watched an interesting statement Thursday by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual violence in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continues, with broadcasters busy with regular events to cover the unexpected last minute events of Friday: a deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh would have been smashing her body in a drunken state and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that didn't happen.
There's a probability that over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, have watched it.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Countdowns for other networks that broadcast this are not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting the number of people who watch it in his office.
To put this in perspective, it's the same number of spectators as the football playoff or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion of the show's hosts strongly supports Kavanaugh's appointment, outperforms all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearings, Nielsen said.
ABC occupies second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million viewers and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Fans stayed high after the trial.
Flake was a key figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being yelled at by protesters as he tried to ride an elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood up for a few minutes when he was mocked, broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think that he's telling the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have power when there are many helpless women".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in the committee hearing.
Cable TV and broadcast networks all covered live a few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee would vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate for the next week, as requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake has been partially convinced by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has power, because it's clear that the Republican Party will not have the vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of playing politics over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining national interests over her plans to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews featured him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed the attack on what he called the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal for the UK and the EU to collect tariffs on each other was "absolutely absurd".
The Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, a suspect in the death of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on the item, WAFB affiliate CBS reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to the fatal shooting of Wayde.
His contract has been set at $350,000, the Attorney reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released an initial report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police criminal lab, Southern University police and the surrounding community for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement for "effort and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
The 6-foot-6-inch resident lives in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and bounced to 2.6 in games last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team felt devastated and shocked by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time", Wade says.
A volcano spewing ash in Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern area around Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in more than 24 hours.
The center monitored several tremors and vibrations.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash sticking to the windshield of a car in the vicinity of Mexico City.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as Don Goyo which has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence election celebrations.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence demonstrators clashed with anti-riot police, and when thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarized vote on self-secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists detained by anti-riot police threw them eggs and painted powder, creating a dark cloud of dust on the streets that would normally be filled by tourists.
A fight also broke out later that day with police using their staffs to control the fight.
For hours pro-independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness" in the face of union protesters shouting, "Life in Spain".
Fourteen people were receiving treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in this independence-oriented region, a year after the October 1 referendum that Madrid considered illegal but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters preferred to be independent, although the number of voters was low with those opposed to secession and mostly boycotting the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at the TPS throughout the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups have camped all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations continued but were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes for Catalonia's prospects of independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry desperately for the right to vote, but now we're stuck", she said.
Despite achieving a vital, albeit minor victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year despite many of their well-known leaders, who are in exile or in custody awaiting trial, for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests with her cell phone in support of the police, said the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more tense now", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 PM BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
The goal scored by Menga has given Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensures victory
Livingston's victory resulted in the Rangers firing Steven Gerrard from his position as manager of Ibrox, for the second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's attack has proved to be a difference when Gary Holt's side moves are equal to Hibernian's second-place finish.
Gerrard's side remain winless in the Premiership this season and face the Hearts leader who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their unbeaten record in the division to six games, while head coach Holt still scored a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed a chance against a careless guest team.
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, with their accuracy giving Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson made the breakthrough but his attempt to slip across the goal line, then Alan Lithgow could only expand his effort after slipping in and facing Craig Halkett's slingshot from across the goal line.
The hosts were satisfied to let the Rangers play out the lead early, knowing that they could make it difficult for the incoming team to get the ball dead.
And that's how you make a very important goal.
Rangers gave up free kicks and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined forces to help Menga, who got his turn and scored from midfield.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated the game but realized that the home defense was unbreakable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was unharmed overall.
The pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos managed to rescue Kelly.
Scott Pittman was stomped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow was sidelined by Livingston's other game-playing tactics.
The attack continued to come to Livingston's goal and was continually avoided, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge to replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were rejected.
The phenomenal from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
For a man, they're amazing, continually exceeding expectations on this ever-rising track.
Their playing style and personnel have barely changed since they returned to the top flight, but great credit must be given to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was very big, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on guard throughout the game.
Still, the Rangers lack inspiration.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was not good - only once they could break through the home side formation - and it was a warning to the Rangers, who were aware of their presence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan has received a mixed reception in Cologne.
There was a smile and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also spoke out, denouncing both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The resistance protests depicted the opposition to the existence of an immigrant who was hailed as a hero by some German Turkish residents and vilified as a dictator by others.
Crash on Deptford Highway: Cyclist killed in a car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car had stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision came months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile away from the Saturday crash.
Metropolitan police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads were closed and bus lines were diverted and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in the riot
Six officers were injured in a riot in a men's prison with high security, the sheriff's office said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Special Operations Tornadoes have been deployed to handle the riot, which involved eight detainees and occurred on one side of the building.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained parole officers have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We are not monitoring the violence in this prison, and it is clear that those responsible will be turned over to the police and may have to spend more time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin Prison houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the prison chief was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police officers were called to the prison to handle a serious riot where a white-collar officer was attacked with a billiard ball.
Storm Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding
The tropical depression that hit Arizona is rare, but it is likely to happen early next week because the remaining traces of energy from the Rosa Storm pass through the southwestern desert, posing a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday for areas from western Arizona to southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight past Phoenix on Tuesday, hitting Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said on Twitter that there have only been 10 tropical storms capable of causing tropical storms or depressive status within 200 miles of the Phoenix area since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest Hurricane Center Forecast is capable of predicting 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with an isolated amount reaching 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert including the central Rockies and Great Basin are most likely to be affected by 1 to 2 inches, with a possible amount of isolation of up to 4 inches.
For those in flood-free areas, Rosa rain may be a blessing because the area is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the southwestern region is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drylands Monitor, only about 40 percent of Arizona has experienced at least one extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reports.
First, the path through Hurricane Rosa leads to the mainland across Baja California from the Mexican peninsula.
Rosa, still at the strength of a storm on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
As a result, it is expected to land in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or night.
Rainfall may be high in parts of Mexico, posing a high risk of flooding
Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected to hit Baja California to southwestern Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches, weather.com reports.
Rosa would then cross the northern part along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression, which would cross through Arizona and into southern Utah by midnight Tuesday.
The main risk that may be posed by Rosa or its remnants is extremely high rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern region of Sonora, and the U.S. southwestern desert region of the U.S. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) states.
The rain is expected to cause flooding and the debris of buildings flowing into the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: arrest of four suspects for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a stab wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, police said.
Officers have urged anyone who may have a video footage of the incident on their cell phone to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh's receiving hatred and anger from the Democratic Party
"One vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and shameful plot", Trump said during a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh received hatred and anger from the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcibly and emotionally denying an accusation from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at trial about his statement.
The president said Saturday that the Americans saw Kavanaugh's intelligence and quality and courage that day.
"A voice of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to uphold the most perfectly legal minded man of our time, a judge with a record of true public servant", he told the West Virginia crowd.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when discussing the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running, he said.
That's why I went there to fight for a great candidate.
Trump argued that Democrats were on a mission to fight back and block.
The first-ever Senate-level voting procedure in Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be in place by Friday, a senior GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people died in the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with the death toll increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them drowned as giant waves hit the coast, when a devastating earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-meter-high wave shattered the beach at dusk, causing many deaths and destroying everything it passed through.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away so they became victims, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) said at a briefing in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, timber, houses, and devastated everything on land, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before devastating the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 service centers in Palu.
Aerial photos released by BNPB show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
A series of earthquakes shook the city along the coast on Saturday.
Seismic shocks were felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Bureau of Technology Research and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb blasts dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, can greatly enlarge the size of the tsunami, so to speak.
Nugroho described the damage as extensive and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under the ruins of the destroyed building, he said, adding that there were 540 victims injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and damage could have been greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication is completely crippled by the lack of information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its members and volunteers were heading to the disaster-affected area.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get worse", he said.
The relevant authorities on Saturday received much criticism for not informing of a tsunami that hit Palu, although authorities said the waves had already hit by the time the warning was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of a building shouting panicked warnings of an approaching tsunami, towards people on the streets below.
In minutes, water rolled over the coast, crashing buildings and cars.
Reuters can't immediately prove the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami were the biggest causes of power outages that disrupted communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has already started sending cargo planes carrying aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the refugees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport has reopened only to channel relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami casualties have risen to over 800.
That's really scary.
When the employees of World Vision from Donggala had made it safely to the city of Palu, where the employees took shelter in the cobbled tents built in their office yard, on the way they had passed through various polluted areas, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed", he said.
It's really awful.
Even as relief groups began to slowly move to start disaster relief efforts, some of them complained of a ban on skilled foreign volunteers, who were about to leave for Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, aid and labour can only begin to flow if the disaster area has been officially declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the Government says, OK, this is a national disaster, we can accept international assistance, but there is no such status.
On the night of the second earthquake and tsunami in Palu, the friends and family of the missing victims still hope that their loved ones will be part of a miracle that will repair the bleak storyline of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled from the gut.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled a woman out of the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national parallax team, has been coaching two missing parallax athletes, who were attending the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped at the Roa-Roa Hotel, along with Mr. Mandagi, are his disciples.
"As a senior in the field of parallax, I have my personal emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recounts how after news of the ruined Roa-Roa Hotel spread around the parachute community, he desperately sent a WhatsApp message to competitors Palu, who were attending the beach celebration.
Still, all the messages received only one grey flash, instead of two blue flashes.
"I think that means the message wasn't sent", he said.
Robbers took $26,750 during the ATM charging in Newport on the Levee.
A burglar on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM machine storage box in Newport, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had already emptied an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a news release.
While he was at work, another man ran behind Brink's worker and stole a bag of money to be sent.
Eyewitnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, based on reports, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identity can contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change via Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Formerly formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has had the nickname Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was made before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, when she was expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande to appear on the show, which was cancelled for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, West previously said that for him the word had religious meaning.
I believe ye is a common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means You, West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with Big Boy Radio broadcaster.
So I am you, I am us, the name is us.
The name is taken from Kanye, which means only one, to be Ye - as a mirror of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we really are.
He's one of a number of rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known in various ways as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator JAY-Z also made it with or without a link sign and a capital letter.
The Mexican president, AMLO, vowed not to use the military in the face of civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians ahead of the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged today on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to never use military force to oppress the Mexican people.
The force fired at peaceful demonstrations on the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time, as the left-wing student movement took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has already secured support for Mexican youth by providing monthly subsidies to those attending college and opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities were driving young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its AI funding.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money it will spend on research in that field, said A2 investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even as the U.S. as a whole lacked a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: aim to be the No. 1 AI innovator by 2030.
"Doubling funding for AI research is a good start, given that all other countries tend to lag behind the U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has already invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that beat the best American Othello players, and after that he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the U.S. government's previous technological competition such as the Robotics Challenge for the Advanced Defense Research Project and asked when further activities would be implemented, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government awards, Lee says.
It's not China that takes academic leadership; it's the corporation, Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring university figures for AI research for the past few years.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. support efforts around AI.
"I think the green card can be automatically offered to those with a PhD in AI", he said.
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding for people in academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the U.S. Department of Defense developed a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
And for NSF, recently DARPA invested over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for the establishment of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen any follow-up for months.
The Macedonians voted to change the name of the country
Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on changing the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that has barred its bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains the view that the name of its northern neighbour represents a recognition of ownership of its territory and has banned its membership in NATO and the European Union.
The two government parties reached an agreement in June on the new name proposed, but the nationalist opposition argued that the change would undermine the identity of the majority of the Macedonian Slavic ethnic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not cast his vote in the general election and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the election results could reach the minimum number of 50 percent votes needed to declare the election valid.
The question on the ballot read: Do you agree to NATO and EU membership by accepting a treaty with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price to pay for getting permission to join bodies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born out of the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to cast my vote for the future of the country, for the young generation of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MPs say they will comply with the results of the vote to make a decision.
The name change would require a two-thirds vote in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
However, it turned out that the voting results only reached 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters gave their ballots.
"I came to give my vote for my children, where we are in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko presented their ballots for the general election in Macedonia in order to change the country's name which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, has already prepared a small stage and pulled seats in front of tents made by those who would boycott the vote.
We agree to join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with honor, not through the servant door, Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can move to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the majority of the population will agree because more than 80 percent of our people support the European Union and NATO", Zaev said after delivering his ballot.
He said the results would be a confirmation of our future.
A poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote - less than the required number.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV station Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they'd vote yes.
For the vote to be successful, it takes 50 percent plus one vote.
A vote failure would represent the first policy rejection of a pro-Western government since taking office in May last year.
Witness: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City scouts all of Brighton's defenses to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were deployed as Brighton's defending champions in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made the win look very easy on his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received an operan in the middle of the field at the start of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before he fell into the open.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green-eyed men.
He spins past one defender before running ahead of several opponents again at Brighton's goal-line.
Then he switches to his left, to Sterling.
The England midfielder used his first kick from the goal to transfer the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-handed kick.
Aguero struggled with some leg problems, Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that point.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the lead in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, far within the Brighton area at the game.
He transferred the ball with a stunning long kick through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little ball-shaking before leading Sterling to the farthest post.
Sky Blue's midfielder drives the ball into goal just before it slides out of the line.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to sue the spoiler versus the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there's no reason to force another game.
But Scherzer, who was too competitive, hoped to beat the Colorado Rockies in Sunday's game, but only if there were still playoff implications for the Rockies, who won one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least earned a spot after winning a wild-card game against the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but are still trying to clinch their first division title.
Even if we played without winning, at least we could get a feel for the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and other teams that would be competing at the highest level from any point I might face this year.
How could I not want to compete in a game like that?
The Nationals have not announced the opening game for Sunday, but it is reported that under such circumstances, they are likely to let Scherzer join the game.
Scherzer, who will start the game for the 34th time, held a practice session on Thursday and began the Sunday game that was usually used for rest.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is a 18-7 record with a 2.53 earned run average (ERA) and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings of this session.
Trump is campaigning in West Virginia.
The president implicitly referred to the situation involving his elected Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh, when discussing the importance of the Republican public vote in the midterm elections.
All the efforts we've made are at stake in November.
Five weeks before the most important election of our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting everywhere for an outstanding candidate, he said.
Trump went on, "You see the very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very radical Democratic groups, you can see what's happening right now.
And they decide to take back power by any means, you see their evil, their abominations.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to save to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "refuse and block".
And you've seen that for the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats angry and mean and ugly and unreliable.
He referred to Sen. Dianne Feinstein who served on the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, which was met with a heavy reception from her listeners.
Remember the answer?
Did you leak the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I was waiting for him -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a public service establishment.
Now he's intolerant of anyone who expresses his opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was no surprise.
After all, I was in the final line of the Members of Parliament, who were told that our attendance was not expected - all because we were expressing our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly for her outspoken defense of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the criticism movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, is an issue that is ironically similar to what Jeremy Corbyn has been challenging with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East workers' meeting on Friday stated that we wanted the meeting to be inclusive and productive.
For almost eight years I was a member of the local Labour Parliament, the General Committee meeting on Friday Night was exactly that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises about better, more friendly politics has long been forgotten, if, indeed, it ever began.
Differences of opinion within the Labour Party are increasingly clearly intolerable and each opinion is judged worthy by the party's authority.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as a colleague who I once thought would share the same political views, began to expect me to turn around and accept positions I would never have accepted before - either in national security or the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak openly - and no matter what I say - then there will be a social media scandal that calls for the cancellation of the appointments, criticizes the central politics, tells me I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me who's been through it.
Of course, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who face sexual harassment or racism every day but never escape.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current political era is how much abuse has been considered reasonable.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should help develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in the wider church and with each movement  disbelief or changing the selection of party rules becomes more limited.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years that encourages me to keep my head down, not to be too vocal, and then I'll say, "OK".
But I didn't jump into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect which led to the literal collapse of my comprehensive school class, I have been striving to fight for better public service for those who need it most - both as a local counsellor and as a minister in government.
I never hid my political actions, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham would question my policy position and the things I disagree with in my current leadership.
For those who advocate a motion on Friday, all I can say is that when a country moves quickly towards a break-up of sovereignty, it will endanger our state business and our public services, I don't want to waste time and energy on loyalty to the Labour leader.
But really, one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituents, as a Labour member or not, and I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political policy will prevent me from doing what I believe is in your best interests.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Ayr undefeated to the top
The last two attempts may have slightly deceived the final result, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to win the very entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
Now they're in the top spot, the only undefeated side out of ten.
In the end, their superior defense, and their ability to get the best chances, gave the home team and coach Peter Murchie the right to feel happy.
"We've tested our game so far, and we're still undefeated so we're happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The reward for Ayr, they're better at taking chances than we are.
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but the yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, given to the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to score and Jason Baggot cracked the unconverted attempt.
Climo loosened Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, just in mid-time, he scored a goal and then made a single attempt to make Ayr's score 17-5 at break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt altered by Baggot, reducing the odds to five points.
Then there was a long break as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury, was kicked out, and since the game resumed, Ayr has been moving faster than Stafford McDowall's attempted attempt, altered by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and again, Melrose made a reserve player pay with an unchanged attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard pressure.
The hosts have returned to play, however, by the time Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for surrounding Climo without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived behind injured Ayr who was forward.
Climo was replaced, as was the case again, almost from the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe kicked a goal and foiled a fifth attempt by the switch-hitter Gregor Henry.
Still Game star looks set to embark on his new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Kieran appears poised to make a move into the service industry after it was previously revealed that he was being named a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis stars in the popular BBC show, which he also directed and starred in alongside his longtime comedian colleague, Greg Hemphill.
The pair have already announced that the upcoming ninth series is the final episode, and apparently Kiernan plans to guide the live broadcast after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that the courts will reopen the way to the Pacific.
The sailors patrol the launch force headquarters in La Paz.
A public building raises a blue sea flag.
The naval base from Titicaca to the Amazon is polished with the motto: "The sea is our rightful possession.
To rise again is an obligation.
Across the landlocked Bolivia, memories of the loss of a coastline to Chile in a 19th-century bloody conflict are still clear - as is the desire to once again cross the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is likely to peak in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course positive expectations for the outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians who will watch the ICJ hearings on a national broadcast, hope that the court in The Hague will support Bolivia's claim that - after decades of tense negotiations - Chile is obliged to negotiate the guarantee of Bolivia's sovereignty over the seas.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who is facing a controversial battle for next year's election - also had a lot of support for Monday's trial.
We're very close to the return of the Pacific Ocean, he took the oath at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide Bolivia's wishes - and that will only change slightly if it is possible.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to hand over Chile's territory, and has established that it will not decide the outcome of the possible negotiations.
That the ICJ's ruling came just six months after the final argument had been heard, which indicated the case was "not complex", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international lawyer.
And while it's far from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the last four years it may have been in recession.
The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the Bolivian government now, he said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has weakened the goodwill of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at some point will still be negotiating, but it will be very difficult to stay in discussion after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's deputy government in The Hague rejected the idea of a swift decision-making.
Monday will give Bolivia an incredible opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of dispute with mutual advantage, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - used maritime issues as a political proponent.
Bolivia will never relinquish its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The trial was an opportunity to see if we needed to solve the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said first of all that his country would never disarm nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday during the UN General Assembly.
He mentioned the United States implementing an agreement made at a meeting in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was seen nearly starting a nuclear diplomacy that had been stalled for more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was only a dream that by continuing U.S. sanctions and refusal to declare a Korean War settlement would make North Korea surrender.
Washington was cautious about approving the declaration without Pyongyang making an effort to limit its armed forces first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about recognizing the arsenal as the only way for the country to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show shows a huge collection of latest headgear up to the main street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or really want to be protected from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne released a series of large-scale headgear for their SS19 collection at the stunning fashion show stage held at Paris Fashion Week.
A completely impractical hat has been sweeping Instagram this summer and these designers are already showing off their eye-catching creations on the fashion stage.
A prominent feature of Valentino was a cream-colored hat, which was decorated with a wide edge of a fur coat covering the model's head.
Large-sized accessories include diamond-decorated hammerheads, witch hats and even a pineapple, but they are not made to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a collection of weird and perfect masks just before Halloween.
There are many masks of different colors whose lips are sewn and are more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature resembling scuba diving gear is equipped with snorkels and eyeglasses, while the other looks like melting ice cream.
And if you keep on looking at that Akbar fashion collection -- then you're lucky.
Fashion observers estimate that the huge hat collection will be marketed to the main street near you.
Large-sized hats became a best-seller trend in La Bomba, a straw hat with a rim with a width of two feet seen worn by everyone including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label worship behind the highly impractical hat the ingenuity of social media created a huge creature on the beach catwalks - a bag of straw that was almost as big as a swimsuit - worn with a model of a shell.
The burnt orange raffia bag, cut with raffia on the edges with white straps, is a highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity hairdresser Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing the big hats and beach bags arrive on the main road next summer - because designers are already making a big impact, it's going to be hard to ignore the demand for these big accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are very important to global citizens.
Scottish private schools maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with outstanding exam results, which were further reinforced by each student and collective success in sport, art, music and hard work.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their role as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement school curricula as expected, we see modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, your words will go into their heads.
If you speak to him in his language, your words will reach his heart".
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's final exam, we can see that the language is at the top of the league table with the highest graduation rate in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn a foreign language get A+ grades.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved A+ in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an important skill that children and adolescents will certainly need in the future.
Today languages, as a choice of subjects, are held in the same standard as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curriculum of modern schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK's Department for Work and Skills in 2014 found that of the many reasons employers must keep struggling to fill vacancies, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly being encouraged to prepare teenagers for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a global world.
Whatever career choices a person makes, if they have already learned a second language, in the future they will experience real benefits from having this kind of lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with residents of foreign countries will automatically make a multilingual superior in the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French became the only language spoken in a two-digit percentage, or 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching for today's children is so important for today.
Having multilingual skills, especially in languages of developing economies, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, every school will teach a different language.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered the most important in the UK for the next few years, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in an independent school, with a staff of teachers who are experts in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland are designed to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
There's no denying that today, in a global business environment, language will always be an important aspect of determining the future of a country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered truly "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish teenagers.
It's got to be good.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent School Board
LeBron is making his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans' wait to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not been determined how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play just a few minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to do pre-season games to prepare", he said.
Schedule of Trump's General Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting the campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five public meetings scheduled for next week, including stops at some of the fun places that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
After being confirmed that the vote was postponed so he could elect a Supreme Court justice, Trump intended to build support for him for the upcoming midterm general election because the Republican Party was at risk of losing control of Congress if the vote was held in November.
What time is Trump's public meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online through a live stream on YouTube.
It's likely Trump will discuss this week's hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is getting tense after allegations of sexual misconduct and the Senate vote forecast will be delayed for a week while the FBI investigates him.
But the main goal of the general meeting's agenda is to help the Republican Party gain some momentum in the run-up to the November general election.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign mentioned that the five public meetings next week aimed to "encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their holdings in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is critical to his agenda so that the president will travel as much as possible to the states during our busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's rally is expected to bring in supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as attracting media coverage from Pittsburgh", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in a month, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate who was left behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come in as an effort to increase his polling proceeds", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show courage to defend their hope in Sunday's single match
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursome session is what might be needed in this Ryder Cup.
The swing of the momentum is a sporting concept that is the result of a finding that is fully trusted by the players, and nothing exceeds that in competitions like this.
Where do they think the momentum is now?
"They used to have six points and now they're four, so I think we're looking at it as a little bit of momentum", Jordan Spieth said as he passed that day.
Europe certainly had the advantage of four points ahead with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth says, feels they have a little momentum and they have a lot of things that can be passionate about, not to mention the lineup of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have been playing together all day and each one is proud of three out of four points.
Spieth has played deadly from tee area to green area and led by a lead.
The celebration screams that roar got louder as his turn came, making the crucial putting stroke to make the series as he and Thomas lost two games to two.
The punch from him that won them at number 15 was greeted with a similar scream, a scream that tells you that he's convinced America won't lose.
"You really have to try harder and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
All these players are gone now.
18 holes to be marked.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
The unique but interesting pair from Europe is four to four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who doesn't do a bogey hit on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoid a bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The run, and how their energy seemed to flow both into and out of this crowded crowd convinced them that they were the players to be beaten on Sunday, and no player more famous than Fleetwood or Molinari would lock in the potential European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
It's better if they're both placed in different holes at the same time.
Still, it's too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefed Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine is like digging a hole that these Spanish and Swedish golfers will never climb.
Although, on Sunday nothing can help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are great shows to watch more closely because of the interaction between the partners, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how strategies can change in an instant.
So far, Europe played better as a team and led quite a bit towards the final day, but the foursome session also showed that the US team had the instinct to compete despite doubts by some, especially in the United States.
Europe lead 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of the Ryder Cup final day after rising from the fourball and foursome matches on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins over Tiger Woods who had to struggle to score their points so far at Le Golf National by four points.
European side Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to defend the trophy that had not been won at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American side that was mis-targeted in the morning fourball, making the series 3-1.
The United States gave up more resistance in the foursome, winning two games, but they could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from 12 single games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to win four straight points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four of their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball they became very solid to beat the knocking Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a more decisive 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally performed brilliantly but he has already lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting on the morning fourball, then returned to pair with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lost 2&1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - world ranked first and third.
Europe did not achieve it on its own despite the pleasant and windy days in southwest Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for America with two points on Saturday.
They got an impressive 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourball then came back again to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history did a team come back from a four-point deficit into a single game, although as defending champions Furyk's team needed only series points to retain the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, Sunday's counterattack seemed to be going beyond them.
North Korea says it's 'impossible' to unilaterally disarm without any confidence
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations about sanctions that continue to deepen their distrust of the United States and that it is unlikely that the country will unilaterally strip its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures that show goodwill" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and pledging not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the United States", he said.
"Without trust in the United States there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation it is impossible for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves first".
While Ri repeated the same complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "stage-by-stage" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be punished for taking a step-by-step step, a significant statement was made that they were not completely opposed as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit between US presidential officials and the newly-elected North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, at which time Kim pledged to work on "the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea had wanted an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang should stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected calls for a relaxation of the international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insisted on 'denuclearisation first' and increased pressure by imposing semi-successful sanctions to achieve their goals by force, and even rejected 'the declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us bend our knees is an illusion of those who don't know about us.
But the problem is that such continuing sanctions will deepen our distrust".
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted by the US leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the problematic side in this denuclearization is South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this kind of dead end".
Nevertheless, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he spoke to the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea's rockets on the US mainland was inevitable after "Mr. President Satan" Trump called Kim "a rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at a UN meeting, Trump, who last year threatened to "destroy" North Korea altogether, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but that big job still has to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter", he said.
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and must not fail until we know that the denuclearization is complete, final and verified".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to halt funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had actually been progress, only that North Korea within hours of invading made "gangster-like claims".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate action".
He stated that Kim ordered him to take the "action that he wants" was the security assurance Trump promised in Singapore and moving toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year is making all the S1 students there sleep more, in an effort to combat the macho culture of learning that is developing through caffeine-powered 'overnight' people.
One academic found that students at the world's number one university often know nothing about the very basic issues of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At last a girl came to me and said: 'Why did I just be told now, in my senior year?'
The girl said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' she told The Telegraph.
The course, which launched first this year, explains to students the essence of how good sleep habits help their academic and athletic outcomes, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding students who were severely sleep deprived throughout the week.
This one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there was a picture of the dorm room, where students clicked on coffee cups, curtains, exercise pants, and books to get an explanation about the effects of caffeine and lights, as well as how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep routines.
In the other part, participants were given an explanation of how long a lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with an interactive icon, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know this won't change student behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke", adds Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in the 'big' is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students that means sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough, good quality sleep should be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he says - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep activates the brain's hunger mode, causing a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied physical chemistry and biology and helped Professor Czeisler design the course, took one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course opened his eyes and inspired him to organize courses for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is for all graduate students to be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting a sleep alarm, also a wake-up alarm, and be aware of the effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can shift your circadian rhythm out of its regular pathway and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Goal to lower Gerrard's forces mental
Again, the Rangers felt the sadness of the day when Dolly Menga's attack brought the divorced Steven Gerrard team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox were attempting to record their first victory of their journey, since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side had just given Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving the side eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
The strike was seven minutes before the first half was over and the Rangers' insane players didn't seem to be balancing.
While Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston are up to third, just behind Hibernian.
And there may be further trouble at Rangers' stronghold after linebacker Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances for the team that beat Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Instead, Holt went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and he'd be happy with a suit that stun their opponents on every occasion.
The Rangers may dominate ownership of the ball, but Livingston uses the ball they have better.
They should have scored in just two minutes when the first short pass was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor, but the midfielder pulled the big opportunity too wide.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs last met captain Craig Halkett but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only stab wide in the back position.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than confidence about their game in the third quarter.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have gotten a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided on a quarter-hour mark but referee Steven Thomson rejected this appeal from the Colombian citizen.
The Rangers managed only two first-half shots but Ibrox's previous goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, had almost never had a problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head-shaped jerk and Ovie Ejaria's easily tamed attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their own hard work.
Once again the Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs' deep deadball tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm choosing Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted during the break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change almost immediately gave effect as the winger put the ball on Morelos but Kelly who played impressively quickly came off the line to guard.
But Livingston kept forcing the away team to play the exact game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping all the long balls.
The Holt team were supposed to extend their lead in the final stage but McGregor stood well to drive out Jacobs before Lithgow pulled wide from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty when he quarrelled with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned away.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now from the pages of our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and today is the day that I will always be remembered... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device being called the Geiger Splitter.
A pioneering scientific tool since then, the Geiger Breaker has also become a mainstay of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring seemingly less convincing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What is that thing?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger Calculator, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can actually hear the atomic effect of radioactivity in minerals".
Evans: "Say, it must be coming up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But it was this discovery that kept his name alive.
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'recognize' malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the process of extracting immune cells from patients, transforming them in the lab.
They can then 'recognize' the protein common to many cancers and then inject it again.
One trial vaccine showed promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches her immune system to recognize malignant cells, lost her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
This method involves the process of extracting the patient's immune cells, turning them into laboratory cells so that they can "identify" the protein commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cells back into them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the United States National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "promotes the growth of several cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
The same approach as taking patients' immune cells and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West starts his pro-Trump diatribe, wearing his MAGA hat, after his SNL appearance.
It's not going well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, entitled Ghost Town where he wore the Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democratic Party and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's racist?'
Yes, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time", he said.
SNL began the show with a play starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's footage of the worms was posted to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to mock West with that post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having difficulty behind the stage because of the hat he was wearing.
"They threw me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat on.'
They kicked me out!
And then they said I was drowning", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the sinking place?" said that he was going to wear Superman's robe, because this meant you couldn't dictate what I should do.
Try to love".
His comments drew ridicule from audiences at least twice and the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling: "The whole studio is silent".
West was brought in at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, the ex-girlfriend of rapper Mac Miller who had just died a few days earlier.
West confused many with the performance of his song I Love It, dressed like a Perrier Bottle.
West gained the support of TPUSA's conservative group chairman, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU for the people".
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being himself and that was really great".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who I believe adheres to and speaks an ideology that is dangerous to my community.
He's free.
So are we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He wasn't the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Along with rapper Snoop Dogg, he got the name Snoop Lion and of course he lived the music legend Prince, changing his name to the symbol and later the artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder charges for stabbing at a Belfast restaurant

The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast District Court on Monday.
This charge will be reviewed by the Attorney General.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has criticized toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword swinging role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO's Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor, who denies the stereotype of macho heroes, says that roles on such screens often make teenage boys feel that they must be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed 'there was something wrong' and questioned how to deal with the bad masculinity issues of the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that he felt "strong enough" to discuss the issue.
'I feel personally, quite strongly, at this moment - where are we wrong in this matter of masculinity?' he said.
'What do we teach men as we grow up, about the problems we see today?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the rise of bad masculinity with its highly masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is character from birth and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel that they must have this particular side to be men?
I think that's really one of the big questions these days - how do we change that?
Because there is clearly something wrong with the young people.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not be playing in the prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he was already 'finished with battlefields and horses'.
From November Kit will star in the return of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best reason to leave Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, thus giving me a family future, and from here my life began,' he said.
Rose plays Ygritte, the love flower of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family residence in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% surge in new cases
China has announced a 14% surge in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, marking a change from the previous one.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be on the rise.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmission of disease comes from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff has leaked GOP senator data, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that one of her staff members had sent personal information of three Republican United States senators to the MP's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party has insisted that the claims were driven by experts and the "ultra-right wing" website.
"Lies, lies, and many other ugly lies", Waters said in a Twitter post.
It is reported that the information released includes the addresses and phone numbers of United States Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
This leak came shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the mail was linked to Waters' office and revealed information from one of Waters' staff members, Hill reported.
"These baseless accusations are completely false and are absolute lies", Waters continued.
"My staff members - whose identities, personal information, and safety are threatened by false and misleading accusations - are not at all responsible for this information leak.
These baseless accusations are completely false and are utter lies".
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This objection is anger", wrote Fleischer.
"It shows he is not fit to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They can't get off course.
They can't question the accuser's motive.
They must be calm and peaceful".
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of looking overly angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is trying to shift Waters in the midterm election, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if true", he tweeted.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities about these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he continued, "and they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are damaging and harmful to any and all of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again - a spoof of the less-than-good Rowan Atkinson spy
Now looking for the significance of Brexit in every new film with a biased British view is a tradition and it seems to apply to the re-emergence of the Johnny English comedy parody franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the satirical sarcasm about how obviously bad we are become a new export opportunity for this country?
Anyway, that blunt-eyed, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has renewed his license to mess things up for the second time - his name indicates more than anything that he is a vast comic creation designed for the non-English-speaking cinema region.
He was certainly a mad secret agent who, despite his strange guesses, had little clouseau character, a sequel to Mr Bean's character and a traveling companion who contributed little to the theme of the Chariots of Fire at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
Indeed, he is based on the international traveler and mysterious man Atkinson once played in a now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving chaos behind him.
There's been a sweet moment or two on this JE trip.
I love when Johnny English approaches the helicopter in a medieval coat and a rotor propeller quickly attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy was featured, but his humor felt less energetic and too bizarre, especially when "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible had been confident to include comedy as material.
His humor felt like it was aimed at children rather than adults, and to me the strange, uninnovative misfortunes of Johnny English and the focus of Atkinson's silent film jokes on Bean's personality.
The warm premise of these years is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated a super-secret British spy web, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to disappoint the agents on duty - unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This was the last chance for the arrogant and hostile prime minister, who had already destroyed her total political popularity: Emma Thompson played a very good role with a quasi-Teresa-May character but little to do with her script.
His clever advisor provided information that since every active spy had been weakened, he had to take someone out of retirement.
And that means that the big guy Johnny English himself, now employed as a principal in some high-end buildings, but gives a secret lesson about how to undercover: there's some good jokes here, when English offers spy academies like the School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for emergency direction and reunited with his long-suffering old friend Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, engaged to a submarine commander, a disgusting upper-class woman role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat out of the picture.
So Batman and Robin who made mistakes on His Majesty's Secret Agent are back in action, meeting the mysterious beautiful Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is alarmingly falling under the influence of a charismatic tech millionaire who claims to solve British computer problems: the villain Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their ridiculous adventure: disguising themselves as waiters, they burn down a French fast food restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves onto a luxury Volta-owned ship; and English sparks anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
All stops are definitely pulled for the final sequence, but with that kind of hospitality and excitement, there's a little kids' TV channel that's got it all.
It's a fairly moderate thing.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that's really suited to his talent?
Labour is protesting that they are planning a plan for British citizens to work four days a week but get paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn of Labour considered a radical plan that wanted British citizens to work four days a week - but get paid five days.
The union reportedly wants the company's owners to pass on the savings through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them extra holidays.
He'll let his employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same pay.
Some sources say that the idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to encourage the state to support workers.
The shift to four days a week has been approved by the British Chamber of Commerce as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
A source, a senior Labour Union official, told The Sunday Times: 'A review of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'This will not happen overnight, but four days a week is an aspiration that is consistent with the party's approach to rebalancing the workers-supporting economy and the party's overall industrial strategy.'
Labour was not the first to support the idea, as the Green Party had already promised four days a week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, at present the aspiration is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'Four working days a week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to refine his vision for a socialist revolution in economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power from the anonymous director and the notary at the utility company.
The shadow chancellor's plan also meant that current shareholders in the drinking water company might not get their entire stake back because the Labour government could make a 'reduction' on grounds of perceived violations.
He also confirmed his plans to put the workers on the company's board and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the company's private sector equity to the employees, which would result in annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their view
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the bureau's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that could change their minds.
It seems Kennedy is more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said I'd attend the hearing, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this, the accusation came up, and I said, 'Did you do it?'
He is a strong man, determined, determined".
However, it seems Graham's voice will never be changed.
"My mind has made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it takes a bigger charge to change that", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but what I do know is: Brett argued loudly", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he mentions his name cannot verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes".
What is the meaning of the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a string of incredibly impressive stars, and a memorable mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the actions of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against poverty.
To get free tickets to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must complete a series of tasks or actions such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been over the past 12 years in achieving its goals?
Is the idea of giving a free concert gift the right way to get people to do something, or is it just another case of "clicktivism" - people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, prompting it to set other goals.
It is said that this action has helped to motivate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37 billion that will impact over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group had collected 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, at least $10 billion of which had been channelled or fundraising.
The group estimates that safe funds have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and practitioners committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", which pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make this social injustice about nutritional deficiencies a landmark in history", Tracey Ullman, the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Answering one of the questions in the FAQs on their website that asked "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizen responds: "It's going to be a long and difficult road - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that came before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars appearing at this year's show in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use Navy as a "blockade" to impede Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could ask for naval assistance to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly suspects that Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular, where it operates at the legitimate invitation of the government - is an excuse to explore the new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to be energy brokers, just like they are in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe", he reported.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to blockade, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market", he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He compared the approach Washington took in dealing with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they were the same.
"The economic choice in Iran and Russia is more or less, fuel utilization and replacement", he said, referring to Russia as one of the "experts in that field" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statement came as Trump administration representatives were on a mission to increase their liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European customers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the unsuitable Nord Stream 2 oil pipeline project, which Trump says is making Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 oil refinery project, designed to double the existing capacity of the refinery's pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin denies that Washington's fierce resistance to the project is purely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be used as a tool to put pressure on and that customers should be able to choose their own suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US attitude has attracted a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would face a big problem if a third country interfered with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will "Look at the Situation" When She Run for President in 2020, said Massachusetts Senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "look into the situation" when she ran for president after the midterm elections.
While campaigning at City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our collapsed government, including putting women at the top", she told The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider the situation when I run for president".
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump during his campaign at City Hall, saying that he "was taking this region in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren was blunt in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday, showed that most of Warren's own constituents did not want him to run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts say senators should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32 percent support the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of running and 48 percent opposing it.
Other important names in the Democratic Party discussed in connection with the possibility of running in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin quotes PTSD Track Palin during the campaign of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the Army in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son went through, what he will go through when he comes back, I can relate to other families who are also experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers have suffered", she told a crowd attending a campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his capture "the elephant in the room" and told of his son and other war veterans, "They came back a little different, they came back louder, they came back and they wondered if there was respect for what they had given, fellow soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence offences against a woman, coupled with reports of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in drunken disorder, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supporting the challenge to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges to new U.S. policies that deny asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of plaintiff Grace v. In a session lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his partner "and his son, who is a violent gang member", had abused him, but U.S. officials denied his request for asylum on July 20.
He's being held in Texas.
State prosecutions in favor of Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers for the U.S., as countries facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy was reversed by a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed black immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades-old state, federal, and international laws".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances surrounding those claims, and such a ban violates the principles", the friend-of-the court brief said.
The prosecution further gave a brief opinion that the policy of refusing immigrants to enter was detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying that they would most likely become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June ordered an immigration judge to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear caused by race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group, or political opinion", Sessions said in the policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum is not meant to alleviate all the problems -- even though all problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
The most tragic rescue effort in Palu is due to the double death toll as they race against time to find the survivors.
For those who survived, the situation was getting worse.
"It was very stressful", says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who is reassuring her fever-prone son at a refugee center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
Clean water is very rare".
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes, taking away the flooded items, trying to save whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, the damage caused by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake was devastating.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, lay outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to a strong aftershock.
Tears flow as he recounts his feelings when the earthquake shook his fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"Not enough time to save myself.
I think I'm stuck in the rubble of the wall", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and then I stopped.
I don't know what's going on with him and my son.
I hope they survive".
US ambassador accuses China of 'intimidating' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after China's official newspaper featured a four-page ad in a US daily that mentioned the reciprocal benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid supplement China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to meddle in the US congressional elections on Nov. 6, an accusation that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the US election, which marks what US officials told Reuters, is a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in a growing trade war, which has led them to raise each other's import tariffs.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa who backed the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers, and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote an opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now doubling the bullying by running propaganda ads on our own free media".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of the American tradition of free speech and press freedom by placing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"Instead, at the street newspaper kiosks here in Beijing, you will find restrictions on different voices and you will not see the real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent media outlets declined an offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
Analysts warn, Republicans are pushing women's votes away from the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh disaster
Because of the number of important Republican Party figures who stood up and defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm general election.
Emotions about the issue were high, and most Republicans were already reported to have expressed a desire to advance the vote.
It's inevitable", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute push to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to ease the anger of voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby as Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee to continue advancing Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be off the list", nonpartisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news website.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among female voters in suburban areas and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, because they dislike the president, often don't vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the sexual abuse of himself by the Supreme Court's nominee, analysts advised of a possible retaliation that would follow if the Republican Party kept pushing him to move forward with confirmation.
"It's a mess for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about committee elections or final ballot or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the bench, it's about how the Republicans handle this issue and how they handle it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided over who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more favorable choice for the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents actually believe or may believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they actually believe or may believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh may or may not have actually lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating charges brought by Ford and one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, who was drunk, had attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez said that the Supreme Court nominee showed her shame when they attended a party while they were attending Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that was trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and whoever is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to start now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
This storage can contain a list of contacts, a list of tasks, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify which are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about this online personal data storage is that it really depends on who the user is able to access what kind of information.
In corporations it's known as "personal empowerment through data".
The idea for establishing Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to deliver the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Today the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few staff developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code makers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not they would introduce a total change where all their business models would actually be reversed overnight.
"We didn't ask for their permission".
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the neutrality of network debate.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next web era", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: commemorating the WW1 cleric Victoria Cross
The only Church clergyman in England to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a warrior, was commemorated in his native land 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the raids at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by snipers and never knew that he had won Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said this stone was a "smart symbol" that would reveal exactly 100 years of his grandfather's achievement winning the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog under the chain of fire from field guns and machine guns".
He then rushed forward to the battle line and with "the greatest courage" led the front line before rushing to use his field gun alone and crippling three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's act was "something I knew I would never be able to live through but it was a very humble act".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to be part of this parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that many will give".
MMA fans spend the night watching Bellator 206, but they actually get Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you've been up all night watching the crowded Bellator 206 just to be turned down to watch the main event.
The San Jose Bill contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the audience in England was stunned when her curls turned into Peppa Pig.
Some feel unappreciated after they have arrived early on the day of the fight.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to children's cartoons as "an annoying joke".
"It's government policy, that at 6 a.m. the content is not suitable for airing, so it's replaced by children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yeah".
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would improve their schedule by taking into account the UK audience in the future.
"I think if we think about re-enactment, I think we might be able to get it done", says Coker.
"But now it's there at six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, in the transition, there's a lot of text going back and forth and all of it's not educational.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical error.
No, it's a government matter.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
We're going to cut down to just five fights from just six fights - as we usually do - and we're going to try to avoid over-watching for fans, and we're doing it.
This is an unfavorable situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'humbled' about his sexuality issues
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a low self-esteem because of his sexuality issues - but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize it until he entered high school, that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent made him not so interested in winning the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off because of illness.
Appearing as the ones who were left out of Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "less than" everyone else she grew up with because "it's not socially acceptable to like men and women".
She says: "To this day, the feeling of inferiority, and the feeling of being different, have become real things that give me the strength and the power to succeed".
She wanted to prove that she was "something", he said, so she wouldn't let everyone down when they found out about her sexuality issues.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known LGBT campaigner and used her performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to draw more countries to abstain from discriminating against homosexuals.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "shocked me".
Daley married an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than her this past year, and she said age gaps were not a problem.
"When you have so many problems at a very young age" - she attended her first Olympics at age 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she says it is very difficult to find someone of her age who is experiencing the same ebb and flow.
The couple became parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says "his whole perspective" has changed.
"If you ask me last year, it's all about 'I should win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there's more to it than just winning an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had already gotten tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'you won't sit in the front row of my dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, finally I admitted that he was unbeatable", she said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of crowds at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling than that", she said.
It also inspired her first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - which she had joined in her preparations for the Olympics and still makes her grumpy.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sundays at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changed roles when booked for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American golfer Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays the 47th Ryder Cup, but he has to change roles to avoid unpleasant achievements.
Mickelson, who played in the biennial event to set a new record for the 12th time, was booked by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball and four-ball group game on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually does for the United States, the five-time major winner splits his time between being a cheerleader and playing his game at that range, hoping to fix what has been troubling him.
Never the most straight-throwing golfer even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old was not fit to take a very rigorous course at Le Golf National, which routinely handed out long and harsh penalties for every wrong shot.
And for his own court, not scary enough for Mickelson, in Game Nine on Sunday, facing the highly accurate English Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If this American golfer, starting 12 singles games with four points down, starts with a hot start, then Mickelson's game proves to be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, not because he could say so much else.
"He really understood his role today, clapped his back and hugged me, and said he would be ready for the game tomorrow", Furyk says.
"He's so confident in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagine the rest, but that's the way it's played out and that's the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people".
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played, on Sunday.
It could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career that would never match his individual record heights.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk says his presence brings some undeniable things to the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a cool guy in the team room", she explained.
"I think the younger players are having fun with him, this week too, which is pretty fun to watch.
He gave a lot, more than just playing".
Captain Europe Thomas Bjorn knew the great advantage could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, learned from experience that a person who leads sufficiently to his last single Ryder Cup game can easily be an unpleasant journey.
Dane made his debut in a 1997 game at Valderrama, with team captain Seve Ballesteros holding a five-point lead over the Americans, but had just touched the finish line with their nose at the thinnest margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we're getting a big lead at Valderrama; we're getting a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but just now", Bjorn said, taking a picture, after watching Class of 2018, winning 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you're going to enter a really boring game.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and the goal is to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've been saying for a long time, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side - the greatest players in the world".
Pleased to see the players playing on a rough golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never progress on my own in this regard.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, the individual players will advance, and this is a different thing to do.
It's nice to be out there with a colleague when everything goes well, but when you're out there playing individually, then your full ability as a golfer will be tested.
That's the message you have to convey to all the players, bring out the best in you for tomorrow's game.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go out to get the best out of himself".
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his players to play better individually than they did as a yapasangann, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of four points.
Furyk himself had been on both ends of the lap on the final day of the big game, having been part of the team that won at Brookline before ending in defeat as Europe performed the "Miracle at Medina".
"I remember every word", he said, answering a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought his players together toward the end.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want to start it as fast as you see it in Brookline, as you see it in Medina.
When momentum moves in one direction, it'll put a lot of pressure on the middle of the game.
We also set up the roster and put people in different ways that we feel, you know, we try to do a miracle tomorrow".
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the opposition against Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other European players in the top order.
"I went with a group of these people in this order because I thought I could close all the roads", Bjorn said of his single choice.
The new German warship is back on hold.
The newest German Navy patrol vessel was supposed to have entered service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warship, but it will not be there until at least next year due to the faulty system and rising costs, local media reported.
The assignment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class guardship, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery issues have disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class guardships.
The ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as radar remover, infrared, and acoustic locks.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - it should be possible to use the latest patrol vessels for two years away from their home port.
However, the continuing delay meant that these advanced warships - which were said to allow Germany to showcase its power overseas - would be obsolete by the time they entered service, Die Zeit noted.
The ill-fated F125 patrol boat had been in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after shipment.
Only a few reasons are known behind the return of the ship, but German media cite a number of important software and hardware flaws that render the warship useless if used for combat missions.
The software defect was important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half the workforce of the older Bremen-class warships.
Also, the knowledge that the ship's weight is so excessive that it will reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the damaged hardware, the production costs of the entire project - including crew training - were also a problem.
It's said to have risen dramatically to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the original €2.2 billion.
The trouble that plagues this newly commissioned patrol vessel has become particularly important given the recent warnings of a reduction in German naval strength.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "out of ships with the ability to spread".
The official said that as time went on the problem grew, as old ships were no longer in use but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class guardships could join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats in secret.
A new study was conducted on a plantation in the Scottish Highlands to uncover how bats use the natural landscape in their food hunting.
It is hoped that this finding will shed new light on the unique behaviour of these flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common pipistrelle and soprano as well as the long-eared brown bat and Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the main locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct a mobile survey using a handheld detector.
The sound engineer who analyzes all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's call and which species performs what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be created to make images on a landscape scale detailing their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine what benefits are gained from habitat management work such as grassland and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout England have declined sharply in recent centuries.
The bat is threatened by construction and development work that affects the nest and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as sticky paper hanging from bat traps and chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, because of its nocturnal hunting habits, its ears are more useful than its eyes in catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo locating techniques to locate insects and obstacles in their flight paths.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres of land across the country, is very concerned about bats.
It has ten trained personnel, who regularly conduct surveys, nest checks, and sometimes rescue efforts.
The organisation has also established the first and only wildlife reserve in Scotland on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten bat species in Scotland.
Plantation manager David Thompson says the plantation is a good bat area.
"Here in Threave, we have a good bat area", he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many old trees, and all the good habitats.
However, there is still much we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us to better understand what they need to thrive".
He stressed the importance of bat inspection before performing maintenance on the property, as there is an unconscious possibility that the destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 female and young bats, which could potentially wipe out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and killing, harassing, or disturbing, or destroying their nest is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's official for the Butterfly Conservation Trust, has urged the general public to help.
He says: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and about many of our species that we don't know how their populations are going to be".
Ronaldo, who denies rape claims, is preparing a lawyer to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news", and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was then alleged to have paid her off by giving her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I was just going to say,
What they say today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known for calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "unacceptable privacy suspicion reports", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said he would seek compensation as "moral damages in an amount appropriate to the severity of the offence, which is perhaps one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported back in the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to a report filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga said Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" that disappointed only "one percent".
The documents say Ronaldo has confirmed that they both had sex, but it was based on shared desire.
Majorga also said that he went to the police station and had been hospitalized for his injuries, but later agreed to settle the matter out of court because he felt "fear of retribution" and feared "public embarrassment".
The 34-year-old woman said she is now trying to overturn the peace settlement because she was constantly traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time the attack was alleged, and this summer he moved to Italian giant club Juve for a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the loss of carmakers
Britain "will regret forever" losing its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that "in regards to Toyota, the UK has told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker says the impact of the border delay if no deal is reached will be detrimental to Brexit in terms of labour costs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the whole of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the European Union by the end of March, we will see production at our factory shut down", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director at Burnaston.
Other British carmakers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem with what the automakers are saying is the supply chain risk if there is no deal with Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the "time-appropriate" production principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If Britain leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store supplies for more than a day at its factory in Derbyshire, said a company representative, and thus production would be halted.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the European Union was "decently calibrated to avoid border checks".
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will also allow what I'm saying not only to enjoy success at the moment, but for us to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The proof not only from Toyota but other manufacturers as well, that we really need to be able to continue what has become a supply chain that is already going very well".
Toyota cannot say how long production will be halted, but what is clear in the long run, warns that the cost increase will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately hurt labor costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is Unite's union manager at the factory, says that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once this job is gone, it will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a sound and reasonable plan for our future relationship with the European Union".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House says.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week" as the battle for supreme court chief Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the general election, the relationship between Trump aides and Russia, as well as the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller's freedom, has sparked rumours in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using a telegram to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "opt out" of firing Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed again to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh, which subsequently delayed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, is on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for that meeting has not yet been set, perhaps this week, I can see that postponing it to another week is also good considering other things that are happening in the supreme court.
But we just watched and I always wanted to get the news to the press".
Some journalists will object to the statement: Sanders hasn't held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the rarity of the meetings was not due to a dislike of TV journalists "who are trying to get attention", though, he said: "I disagree with the fact that they are trying to get attention".
Then he proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The president has conducted more live question and answer sessions than the previous president", he added without mentioning evidence: "We have seen the numbers".
The meeting is still going to happen, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States a question directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often and you've seen us do a lot of it in the last few weeks and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump routinely asks questions when he leaves the White House or participates in an open session or press conference with visiting senior officials.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president will probably show his reasons, make a freakish and sometimes bizarre appearance before the press gathers.
The Secretary of Health wrote a letter to EU workers at the NHS Scotland about concerns over the Brexit issue
The Secretary of Health has written a letter to EU staff working at NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hope they will continue to work here after the Brexit crisis.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until Britain withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has committed to cover the cost of submitting permanent status for EU citizens working in the public services being transferred.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on this withdrawal were still ongoing, approaching a decision expected this fall.
But the British government is also prepared for the possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I now want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessean Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the game ended.
"He came to the edge of the field and passed out there", Reed said.
The coach and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before placing him in the stall and taking him for further evaluation.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details on the type/level of injury sustained" and the State of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore in this red jersey, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being traded from Illinois.
He got a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which made his total tackles during the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp fee when they buy property in the UK, plus additional money to be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plan.
This move will slow the pace of success of Corbyn's movement in attracting young voters.
This increase in stamp fees will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department estimates it will raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - along with the extra money to be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
This move will be seen as an attempt to slow the pace of Jeremy Corbyn's successful efforts to attract young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting higher incomes.
The increased stamping costs will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, along with additional money that encourages the Government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional cost - which is an additional cost to the current cost of the seal, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second home purchases and home rental purchases - could reach three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to rise to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-British residents, which causes prices to rise and makes it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to step on the housing ladder.
Many of the country's rich areas - usually in the capital - have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamping costs to help more young people have their first home.
He accused the major construction companies of keeping the property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to ignore quotas for affordable homes in order to fix the "homelessness" in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of interesting housing reform proposals, including a rent control and ending "innocent" evictions.
He also wants to give the council more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I promised myself that I would dedicate my prime ministership to restore the British dream - that life should be better for every generation.
And that means fixing our collapsing housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not appropriate for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy a home as easily as hardworking British residents.
For many people the dream of having a home becomes something very remote, and the unkind treatment of the homeless remains real".
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the Scottish team'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "primary ambition" was to manage Scotland at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scottishman, enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One, three points clear of the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I want to defend my country as a player.
I got the B-hat and there he is", Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up and often watched the Scottish team at Hampden with my father as a child, and it was always something that attracted me to come back.
However, that opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management".
Sunderland's managers before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of big names at such a club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the current success will be measured by 'can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, there is no doubt about being in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task to be there, but I'll probably only see myself as a successful person here, if I can bring this club back there".
Ross's career in team management spanned only three years, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to third place, and turned St Mirren from relegation to championship title winner the following season.
And Ross said he now feels more comfortable than he has ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"This may be the crossroads I have to cross", he recalled as he took over Alloa.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I'm fine, making a living in a reasonable way, and enjoying some reasonable things.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot you have to go through every week.
I still have it in terms of work pressure, but in management it feels good.
I always wanted to lead something and now I do, the most comfortable feeling I've ever had in my adult life".

The survey found that the best time to drink beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted pubs' revenue in the UK that are struggling to survive, but more pressure is put on the restaurant chain.
Figures show that pubs and bars saw sales rise by 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant revenue fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, the CGA business consultant who compiled the figures, said: "The bright sun and England's longer-than-expected World Cup participation mean July will follow the same pattern as the previous June, where pub revenue rose 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that got a hard hit.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June will worsen in July.
The sales of pubs and bars selling drinks so far performed stronger than those of down-market restaurants.
Pubs selling food also suffer from the heat of the sun, though not as bad as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just go out for a drink.
Sales across managed pubs and bars selling beverages rose 6.6 percent for the month, with those selling food falling three percent".
Paul Newman, a recreation and hospitality analyst at the NGO, said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors affecting outdoor market sales.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle to survive, even though a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales will be very painful over the ongoing cost pressures.
The long summer should not come when the food vendors are having a bad time, and time will tell if the fairly good temperatures we already enjoyed in August will provide the little rest we need".
Total sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a slowdown in brand launch.
Coffer Peach Tracker's industry sales tracking for the pub, bar and restaurant sectors in the UK collected and analyzed performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is an industry benchmark that cannot be denied anymore.

A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Headmasters and Headmistresses of Women (HMC) from independent schools, found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them claiming to have personal accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing so many teenagers who are trying to create online spaces that their parents and teachers can't find".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Council.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletic Council as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his diverse experience at international level over the past few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world athletics community and we believe athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him on board", says Beattie.
Doyle said: "I act as a voice for athletes and I hope to be able to really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American athlete, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among his four Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC expert, is now unable to walk after suffering a brief ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said that only time could determine whether I could recover and to what extent.
It was a very tiring job to recover fully, to learn how to walk again, and to do a dexterity exercise today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump ads that compare mothers to cows have divided the online world.
The breast pump company has divided the online world with an ad that compares a breastfeeding mother to a cow being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a humorous music video to showcase the freedom this new pump gives a mother to express herself.
Four mothers dancing in a haystack with a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I'm red myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice this isn't a claw, this is my breasts".
It continues with the refrain: "Pump out, pump out, I feed them, baby, pump out, pump out, I turn my female milk red".
However, the ads that have been posted on the company's Facebook page have sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it's making a stir in the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, cows must also become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless their babies are stolen from them within days of giving birth, someone wrote.
Elvie's breast pump is perfectly suited to the breastfeeding bra.
Another comment: "A trauma that is understandable to both mother and baby.
But why not use it to advertise breast pumps for moms who have to babysit?"
Another added: "A meaningless advertisement".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "funny".
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'd buy it if I was still breastfeeding.
Tightening makes me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I accept it for what it is.
It's a genius product", someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who are bullying (often at their workplace or toilet) and who feel like "cows".
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with a hidden pump inserted into their bra.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the perception of many breastfeeding women who say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, without wires or tubes and fits in a breastfeeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while harassing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is a pioneering product that deserves to be launched convincingly and provocatively.
By equating the picture between expressing women and cattle we want to pump milk and all the obstacles to its challenge, and show it in a way that is entertaining and enjoyable with the full freedom that the new pump brings.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.

Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Move to Camp Camps on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained is increasing despite the fact that monthly border crossings remain unchanged, partly as a result of the tough statements and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it harder to raise children with sponsors.
Basically, most of the sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants, and they fear risking their own ability to stay in the country by taking steps to save the children.
The risk increased in June, when the federal government announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor runaway minors.
The agency then confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who become sponsors or members of sponsoring groups are in the country illegally, and most of them are malicious foreigners.
That's why we keep hunting these people", Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to process children more quickly, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, which was the standard before, said shelter workers.
Most of them appear via videoconference calls, rather than directly, to petition their legal status cases to immigration judges.
Those deemed unworthy of assistance will be immediately deported.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or attempted escape, shelter workers said and system reports received in recent months.
Lawyers say the concern is growing in larger facilities like Tornillo, whose signs of a struggling child tend to be overlooked because of their size.
They say that moving children to a camping town without providing them with enough emotional preparation or saying goodbye to their friends can aggravate the trauma they have long struggled with.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish 'occupying forces' to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war is now entering its eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were occupying Syrian territory illegally, on the grounds of fighting terrorism, and "will be treated as they should be".
"They must withdraw as soon as possible and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than a million people fleeing their homes.
He asserted that Damascus will continue "to fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory" of terrorist groups and "illegal presence of foreign troops".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, specifically training and influencing Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France had more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn territory.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem insisted that they should return as soon as possible, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading the terrible fear" that pushes them further away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return", he said.
"They politicized what should be a complete humanitarian issue".
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition was reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the rebel stronghold of Idlib has provided an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevents a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, which has three million inhabitants.
But Moualem insisted that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and raised hopes that military action would target the mujahideen including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eliminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly convene the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war law for Syria and pave the way for a general election.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, insisting that the panel's work should be limited "to reviewing the provisions of the current Law", and warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Trump will win another general election in 2020 unless, as many liberal audiences hope, prosecutions and scandals end his presidency early.
No one doubts, "The most dramatic presidential end ever!"
So far, there's been no sign of exhaustion for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC's nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped cable TV ratings with 3.5 million viewers on prime-time night.
"It's a passion that makes people interested because it's something they don't understand", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about the cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol bombing.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths in Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club", had another theory.
He remembered taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he'd give Trump his vote.
Why?
"He said, 'Cause he made me laugh,'" Miss Scovell told me.
There's a value to entertainment in a mess.
Certainly, unlike other TV shows, the story line that emerges from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and restore the global economy.
Instead, it's a luxury that can only be felt by the most exclusive audience.
Yet, not only are you an informed citizen at six o'clock you find yourself watching a panel of experts debate the use of Bob Woodward's "background" source for his book entitled "Fear", wearing Paul Manafort's $15,000-a-dozen-foot pigeon-skin bomber jacket and the implications of Stormy Daniels' appalling description of Trump's anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario the same again.
"Part of the policy he's making makes it look like a reality show that entertains you every night", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's daily show scenes and storylines (choosing to be hostile to the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was hiding while watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't afford to free himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh being prepared to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and then the Supreme Court on his own terms.
"I remember when we were having all these crazy shows that day and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were true".

A lot of money from outside floods the toughest part-time election competition in the White House.
It's just that Pennsylvania 17 is flooded with money, thanks to the reorganization of the congressional district that has two trustees in the same seat race.
Pittsburg's recently reorganized district, nominated Conor Lamb of the Democratic Party - who won seats in other districts through a special election last spring.
Lamb advanced against another Republican, Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps with the new Pennsylvania 17th district.
These maps were re-launched after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally Republican.
The rivalry in Pennsylvania's new 17th district has resulted in a large campaign fund between the major party's financial side, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a slim victory in a March general overseeing special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been held by Republican officials for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political pundits are sending the Democratic Party a little bit more power.
U.S. Considering Sanctioning El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Withdrawing
Diplomats have confirmed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing, putting some pressure on Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and booked a hotel in Panama until the partner expelled the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the head of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore", Heather Nauert, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions are only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including for narcotics control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hurt the Central American nation and increase unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meeting was taking place, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on the same meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials confirmed that they wanted the conference to resume, effectively ending the sanctions consideration for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to address the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of government importation into the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing any new reproach or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate presented by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations of this vague situation.
Their statements were corroborated by outside analysts close to the government and also spoke about this vague situation.
The Story of the Study
Another shocking story is special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstruction of justice for Mr. Trump, which currently holds a very important piece of evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller's report also discusses his investigation into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in attacking our election.
If Congress moves hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to himself, just as he's preparing to go again before the electorate, and may eventually become a judge of his peers.
So there's still a lot to do, and I'm not going to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump's administration is inevitable - or his vigilance in Europe.
There are choices we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid years of slaughter that followed.
The beginning of history centers along such a point of divergence, and an accelerated or delayed march of democracy is inevitable.
Now Americans are facing some of these changes.
What should we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversees the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since the paper reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be secretly recorded and argued that he was not worthy of the presidency.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was not true.
"How will we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if he is brought to the Supreme Court despite strong accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, will we vote part-time for Congress to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail that test, democracy will deteriorate in the long run.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once housed my embassy.
He survived, then immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, asked me to light a Sabbath candle on a table with a swastika.
By leaving that legacy to me, how could I lose hope for our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is feeling optimistic ahead of the game against Rapid Vienna.
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, armed with a victory over Austria, following a good draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will strengthen their position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing in his first season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he was confident the Rangers could use the result as a stepping stone to a bigger hope.
"This is a very good point for us because Villarreal is a great team", said the 31-year-old.
"In this game we were sure we could get something and go by one point.
In the end, we might be able to do it, but we think the draw might be a fair one.
In the first half, they might have done better but in the second half, we got up and became a better team.
As we set foot on Thursday, tonight becomes another big day in Europe.
We were hoping to score three points even though it would be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but, with the support of the fans behind us, I'm sure we can keep going and get a positive result.
Last year, we had a hard time, because of my injury and the changes at the club itself but now there's a very good hope at the club.
The squad's great and the kids really enjoy it. It's a good practice.
I hope we can thrive now, put the past behind us and achieve success".

Although it turns out that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people discussed it with their family members.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study discussed the cost of long-term care with their partners.
Only 10 percent of them said they discussed this with their children.
"They want family members to provide care, but there is no step to start the discussion", says Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance business Nationwide.
This is the time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your own family for care if you do not tell them what you want first.
Discuss with your counselor and family how and where you will receive treatment, because your choice will be crucial in determining the cost.
Engage your financial advisor: Your advisor can certainly help you to show how to pay those expenses.
The financing you choose for long-term care includes traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid cash insurance policies that guarantee these costs or insure yourself with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Show your legal documents: Facing a contentious legal dispute.
Appoint immediately the authority for your health care, that is, someone you trust to ensure your health care and ensure that your wishes are met by professionals when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, your financial authority should also be considered.
Someone you trust to take care of all your financial decisions you should choose, besides ensuring payment of your bills if you can't afford it.
Always remember every little detail: Imagine when your elderly parents are in a medical emergency and on their way to the hospital.
Are you ready to answer questions about treatment and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready to answer.

A man was shot with a wind gun in Ilfracombe.
A man was shot with a rifle on his way home from a night party.
The victim, in his 40s, was in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when several shots were fired at his chest, stomach and hands.
The shooting was described by officers as taking place around 02:30 BST, and was said to be "random action".
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The injuries suffered by the victim were not life-threatening and a number of witnesses have been brought forward by police.
Earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia
The earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday killed at least 384 people, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The disruption of communication made it difficult for the officials to get information from Donggala County, a region north of Palu city that was closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some key facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
Donggala, meanwhile, is a district stretching over 300 km (180 miles) from the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administrative region under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
The mainstay of the economy in South Sulawesi province is fishing and matching crops, especially on the Donggala coast.
However, nickel mining is also important in the province, although most of it is centered in Morowali, across the Sulawesi coast.
In the last 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times, according to data from the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in the tsunami disaster and hundreds of homes in Donggala were destroyed by the Great Depression.
In 1996, nine people died in the tsunami disaster in western Donggala.
Seismically, Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and so earthquakes will occur on a regular basis.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have struck in recent years:
2004: On December 26, Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake, specifically on the west coast of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered tsunamis in 14 countries, claiming 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coastline, and more than half of those killed were in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of similarly powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
On Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were reported dead.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami off the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
The death toll was more than 1,100.
2010: An island off the island of Mentawai, off Sumatra, is also struck by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that triggered a 10-meter-high tsunami that instantly devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya district, Aceh, also experienced a shallow earthquake and resulted in devastation, as well as panic from people who remembered the devastation from the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
Although this time there was no potential tsunami, over 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Lombok, nicknamed the tourist island, also suffered a major earthquake that killed more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and, at the same time, accommodated thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's son is arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on suspicion of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest attempts, as the Alaska State Police released a report on Saturday.
According to police reports, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, he confiscated the woman's phone.
Palin was handed over to Mat-Su Pre-trial detention, with a $500 fine without bail, as reported by KTUU.
As reported by news networks, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, as he believes" when asked about his defense.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could carry a prison sentence of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
In addition, he was also charged with a Class B felony, with a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
For Palin, this is not the first time he's been charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to make a report of the alleged attack.
The case is currently on appeal to the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence crimes, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, which were also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of spitting on his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans for linking her son's violence to PTSD as a result of her service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of victims died
On Friday, a powerful earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, killing at least 384 people.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake that could potentially trigger a tsunami has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications were cut off, and deaths are expected to continue to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake struck central Sulawesi, located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing how terrible the disaster was were circulated on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, when the tsunami shattered the beach.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for terrorism suspects in NYC.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare and uncommon state sentence for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is alleged to have carried out the assault by crashing a truck he rented from the Home Depot into pedestrians and cyclists on a bicycle lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious bodily injury, based on a statement of intent to abolish the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Based on court documents, both charges are likely to result in the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in the launch of extortion, which is typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as counts of assault and attempted motor vehicle destruction.
According to the prosecutor, the attack required "substantial planning and early maturation", as Saipov's crimes were described as "wild, cruel, and unethical".
It was stated in the will statement, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has resulted in injuries, danger, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
The five victims of the incident were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last dropped a death penalty lawsuit.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of murdering two drug dealers, was eventually sentenced to life in prison.
The last execution in federal court in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse as the days and months after the attack went by.
When questioned by investigators, he said he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov also revealed to authorities that the attack was inspired by ISIS videos he watched from his phone, as well as the charges.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges brought against him.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys general representing Saipov, expressed "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"In our view, the decision to execute death rather than accept a guilty plea to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of those involved in the incident", Patton said.
Earlier, Saipov's defense team had pleaded with the prosecutor not to impose the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for Brexit negotiations, Tory MP says
Nigel Farage called for a "moving people's army" today in a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics - because one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested taking a stand in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative group supporter Peter Bone told a street rally in Birmingham that Britain should 'get out' at this time if only Farage were to serve as Brexit Secretary.
However, the challenge May faced in reconciling her divided seat has been underscored by Remain Tories supporters who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggled to maintain his Chequers compromise plan to stay on track despite the attacks of the Brexiteers, Remainers and the European Union.
Allied countries stressed that he would be pushed forward to reach a deal with Brussels, even if it got a bad reaction - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to decide between his package of proposals and 'disorder'.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave crowd in Solihull that he wanted to 'get rid of Chequers.
His proposal, that Farage should appoint a partner to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"If he's the one in charge, we're out now", she said.
Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I am ready to stand for Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers".
He said, while pointing out his opposition to the European Union: "We are not fighting a world war to be submissive.
We want to set our own laws in our own country.'
Bone rejected the proposal that public opinion could potentially lead to change since the 2016 vote: "The suggestion that the British people's minds have changed and want a stable condition is completely false".
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who was also involved in the mass action, told reporters: 'Simply put, I want to say: Prime Minister, listen to your people.
Chequers are not popular with the general public, while the Opposition will not vote for them, because they are not popular with the party and our activists who have seriously taken to the streets and made us the first elected position.
Our request, get rid of Chequers and start listening to us.'
In a message to May, he added: "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when their promises are kept".
Farage said that politicians should be allowed to "feel the heat" if they want to reject the 2016 referendum decision.
 Right now the most valuable thing is trust between us - the people - and our political class, he said.
'They tried to deny Brexit and here we are today, assuring them that 'we will not let you do that.'
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: 'I want you to make our political class, which is preparing to reject Brexit, feel the heat too.
We are moving the people's army of this country who will win us out of Brexit and will never give up until the United Kingdom is an independent, self-governing, and proud nation.
Meanwhile, the Remainers' mass moves through Birmingham before holding a two-hour action in the city centre.
A line of activists appeared to be waving Tories Against Brexit banners after they pulled their line this weekend.
Labour's fellow, Lord Adonis, mocked the Conservative group over the security issues of their party's app when the conference opened.
These are the people who tell us that they can take over the IT system and all the technology for Canada, whatever, for the sake of an anti-trampling border, for the sake of unlimited free trade in Ireland, etc.
It's a funny show.
There is no good Brexit at all", he added.
Warren is planning a serious crash in the presidential race.
Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "crash the presidential race" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic Party declared its future at the town hall in western Massachusetts, on Saturday.
Warren, who has often criticized President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against state GOP representative Geoff Diehl, vice chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he's already been labeled as Trump's opponent in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's meeting in Holyoke was the 36th with its voters, held in a city hall format since Trump took office.
One participant asked him if he had any plans to run for president.
Warren responded that it was the right time "for women to enter Washington's circle to restore our broken government, and that included the time for women to rise to the top".
The Sims shooter, the LSU player, was caught.
On Saturday, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced their arrest of a suspect in the shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. at an ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, where a man was identified as asking for help as seen on the footage.
Friday morning, Sims, 20, was shot and found dead near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being at the scene, holding a firearm, and shooting it at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without meaningful resistance and was placed in custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6, 6-inch junior player, growing up in Baton Rouge, that's the Sims figure, has played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after the team acknowledges its victory over Sebastian Vettel
It all became clear when Valtteri Bottas took the lead over Lewis Hamilton in Saturday's qualifying round which would bring the Mercedes team's order to play a big part in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good starting position and almost left Hamilton as he retained his position in the first two turns and drew Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel was the first to rush into the pit and let Hamilton move into the density at the end of the crowd, something that should have been very decisive.
Mercedes went into the pit one lap afterwards and out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to drive after a few chase actions that showed the reluctance of the Ferrari driver to leave the inside empty at risk of defending after a double move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started at the back of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race as he held off a tyre change to target a quick finish and took Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth place.
He finally got into the pit on lap 44 but was unable to improve his pace on the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen eventually took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man let me.
The team has done an amazing job of having one two, Hamilton said.
That's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday through her insistence that she not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford regarding allegations of sexual violence against future Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver a statement Ford made before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on what was happening in the senate that exposed people who were "wicked and disgusting and dishonest".
"Something that could happen and wonderful things that have been happening over the past few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry and mean and ugly and dishonest people", he said.
"When you see the spills and leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the documents-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I did not.
I didn't leak it".
All right, hold on a second.
What we leaked... No, we didn't leak it", he added, as a senator's impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and the matter had been leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak was from his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's accusations, I'm not leaking the story", Feinstein told the committee, Hill said.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as he asked".
But his refusal seemed disapproved by the president, who commented during the rally Saturday night: "I'll tell you, it's really bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense against the future Chief Justice, who was accused of sexual assault of three women, the president was impressed by the Democratic assumption of using the charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to take power in various ways.
You see the evil, the frustration, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk for power and control, the Mediaite report on the president's speech.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 with the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars offset their Friday loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the home game 5-3 on Saturday.
Giant took a two-goal lead first after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the hosts to a balanced lead before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied the lead for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for the Adam Keefe men, who managed to catch up and eventually lead to be able to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning three games in the previous game.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 of a pass given by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford providing the pass as Beauvillier managed to double the lead four minutes later.
In the tight opening period, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt was the feeder for the balancing act that Cownie did at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead at the first halftime by scoring the second night goal late in the first period.
The hosts reunited and Bouchard once again balanced their position with a power play goal in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee a lead for the first time at the end of the second period and he secured victory with his team in the mid-fifth period during the final period.
The Giants, who have so far suffered four defeats from their five games, are on home soil to face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die to ensure hundreds of passengers on board are safe from the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was hailed as a hero after his death while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more disappeared after a major earthquake hit the Sulawesi Islands on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The strong aftershocks continued to shake the region and many were trapped in the ruins in the city of Palu.
But even though his companions fled for their safety, 21-year-old Anthonius the Great refused to leave his post at a rocking tower at Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport, Palu.
He chose to stay on to ensure Aircraft Battery Flight 6321 which was at the time on runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he felt the tower starting to collapse.
He died afterwards in hospital.
Indonesian Aviation Navigation Service's spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could save hundreds of lives, ABC Australia reported.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Borneo to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter made it to Palu.
We're all sad to hear this, he added.
Meanwhile, authorities feared the death toll could reach thousands after the National Disaster Management Agency said access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities was difficult.
"The number of victims is believed to continue to increase as many bodies are still crushed by the rubble and many others are not reachable", said national disaster relief agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching six meters had made the Palu fluffy which led to a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries a dead body.
Clean water is becoming scarce.
Minmarkets everywhere are looted"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It's been a tragedy, but it could get worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was also hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini reports one person missing after the lagoon plane crash
Airlines operating flights that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia reported one person had disappeared, after previously being handed over to 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated safely from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement Saturday afternoon that the party could not identify a male passenger.
The airline said it had worked with local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to find the man.
The airline did not promptly respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people have been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the sequence of events as a whole are still unclear.
Airlines and the U.S. Navy both claimed the plane landed in a lagoon around the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt the plane was over runway.
U.S. citizen Bill Jaynes said the plane came in at a very low rate.
"That's really a good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to get water as high as their waist through the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He conveyed the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said fishermen working closely around the repaired pier also helped rescue using rubber boats to transport people to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in registered-GST airline crashes over the past two decades but none involving Air Niugini.
Analysts crossed the timeline of the burned-out night woman.
The arrest charge came on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of arson in a 2014 Mississippi woman.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used cell phone footage to gather the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones showing Tellis was in the same location as Chambers the night of his death, in contrast to the defendant's earlier statement, reportedly Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed the defendant's cell phone was in the same location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was then with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked Sanford for an explanation.
Sanford attended the hearing on Saturday and he testified that he was not in town the day of the incident.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was being honest when he said he was in a Sanford truck the night of the incident, Sanford said he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency presented by Tellis was his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks before the victim's death.
Cell phone footage indicates they knew each other within a week.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers' death, sometimes Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He wiped the victims out of his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing statement on Sunday.
The judge stated that he hoped the trial would lead to a jury after that day.
The High Breed: What is the spirit of hip hop?
A group of hip hop trios wanted to challenge the genre's negative views by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claimed that the hip hop movement moved away from the origins of political messages and pursued social issues.
They want to get back to their roots and make hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
The other black guy?!
New York nanny sues a couple for assault after issuing a racist message
A New York nanny sued one couple for discriminatory assault after receiving an indirect message from a complaining mother stating that she was another black person.
The couple rejected being considered racist, and viewed it more as a "couple".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her anxiety when she realized that her new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black just as she was on her first day at work in 2016.
"There is no other black person", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Anyway, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, stating that they fired the nanny, who was a mixed African-American citizen, for doing a bad job and she was more expecting Filipinos, according to the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then returned using Uber.
Maurice is now demanding compensation for the dismissal, and is asking for about $350 a day for a six-month period, as compensation for the babysitting job he was originally required to do, even without a contract.
I wanted to show them, look, you can't do something like that, he told the Post on Sunday, then added, I know it's discrimination.
The couple opposed claims that they were racist, that the fired Maurice was a legitimate thing to do, that they were afraid they couldn't believe him after insulting him,
"My wife sent me something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist, "Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But can you let your children be cared for by someone you've been caring for, even if it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, you two".
As wrapped in a wrapping, Plasco said his wife was just two months pregnant and was in a very difficult situation.
"You're going after someone in that condition?
That's not a good thing to do, the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has made quick filings against the couple on social media, blaming their attitude and logic.
Paddington's publisher is worried that readers will not be able to communicate with the talking bear, new newspaper reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, was described in a letter.
It's funny to know as we know of Paddington's great success".
Saying his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspiring through the writing of a children's book with bear toys, was very optimistic about the results of his work that had been rejected, he added the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book felt "bitter" after his father's death last year.
To Paddington, whom he describes as a very important member of our family, he added his father was quite proud of his eventual success.
"He's a quiet enough man, and he's not a proud man", she said.
"But because Paddington meant so much to him, it was like having a child who had achieved something: you were proud of them even though not all of your efforts.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was the result of his creativity and imagination, he always gave praise to Paddington himself.
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
By the time she landed, her daughter was rushed to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but doctors failed to rescue her.
"Nad made the call calmly to convey it was so bad that he was very unlikely to survive", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that said he was going to die within two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did it.
I said, Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors had given him to keep his heart beating slowly wore off and left his system.
He died a few days before the treatment process was underway and it all felt deadly.
I could just sit there and wait, understanding all this had been revealed.
I can't groan, or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold on to all that".
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - unaware of what had happened to her.
"No one knows", he said.
"My head was lethargic and my tears were continually flowing.
It's hard to explain, but on that flight I felt such a deep sympathy for Nad.
That she needed love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her".
The grieving women post cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones try to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspirational messages and contacts for support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent feeling the way I feel every day", she says.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son is a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always say that her smile lights up the atmosphere".
But he stopped working before he died, as if he were "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
"I'm constantly worried about the long-term effects", says Mrs. Davis.
Mrs. Davis made the cards, "to tell people that there are others out there that you can feel and talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't sit and sit - you need to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, who was friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"She didn't say if she was sad or depressed or anything", he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He's at his lowest point on Christmas Day - when the kids open their presents he doesn't look them in the eye or anything".
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to go through it: "It creates a family gap.
It separates us.
But we have to get through it and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future was in doubt when the FBI began its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking for - a time-limited investigation, limited in scope - we might be able to bring a little unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would collapse amid the stalemate of the council's ruling.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigating?
Their reluctance is all due to time.
The legislative election is five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, they will be very weak in their chances of getting the person they want elected to sit on the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and during that meeting with his wife Ashley, who is Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will sit.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean rebels under Kim
The number of people who defect from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a member of the Allied Korean parliament.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unity Ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most of the North's refugees were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China treats refugees as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them back.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have greatly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on delayed denuclearization negotiations.
This came after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work together on the Korean Peninsula that is nuclear-free.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, it is unlikely that we will drop our weapons unilaterally", Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of being a "hysterical" man, saying he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Opposition Party Chairwoman Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical" and said she was not fit in the temperament to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman performs like that, they'll say 'histeric,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judicial Council Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In her opening statement, Kavanaugh was emotionally overwhelmed, sometimes nearly screaming and having difficulty speaking when discussing her family and her years in high school.
He also outspokenly condemned Democrats on the committee, saying the charges against him were "unreasonable and coordinated character killings" organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that she could not serve on the Supreme Court because she was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and with his attitude toward Clinton and Democrats", he said.
Pelosi expressed objection if he would try to sue if he was approved, and if the Democrats won more votes in the House of Representatives.
I'd say this -- if he didn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, but also to be on the court where he is now, Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the D.C. Superior Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was worried about the potential Kavanaugh ruling against the Health Services Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was seen as a conservative justice advocate.
In the impeachment hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for someone who is hysterical and biased to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to deal with it.
It was an ethical trait, anger for months and years, and he couldn't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry, "Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, what do you think?"
He went on, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm getting mad".
And then he kept going.
And I think that's brilliant.
Tears are shed as an outlet for anger in part because it is basically misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of my early work, in a male-dominated office, one time I was crying with an inexpressible rage, was that my neck was grabbed by an older woman - a cold manager I was always a little afraid of - who dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they think they're doing it".
Patricia Schroeder, who is a congresswoman from Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Ms. Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason for her not to run for president.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision", she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called her Snow Princess and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because it was too late in the campaign, he was left behind in fundraising, and so he swore he would not run until he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a battle that ended in defeat.
He found that some of his supporters who gave a man $1,000 only gave him $250.
"Do they think I get a discount? he wondered.
When he announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to those who supported him, frustration with the system that made fundraising so difficult and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - making it difficult to speak.
"You'd think I was too nervous, "Mrs. Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to him.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my side?
"She was crying"?""
How US-China trade competition might be good for Beijing
The opening shot of the trade rivalry between the US and China is so devastating, and while the fight is still far from over, the instability between the two countries may well be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US President, issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
A very significant increase was imposed starting this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods entering the US through China.
Beijing has responded every time, recently imposing a five to ten percent tariff on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has begged to match the US one-on-one, and the world's second largest economy will not change anytime soon.
Telling Washington to back off means following their will, but publicly defeating the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, US trade competition pressure could support China positively in the long run by reducing the dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that swift political decisions by Washington or Beijing could make the conditions that trigger economic movements in both countries actually more dangerous than what observers have known before", says Abigail Grace, a fellow Asian-focused researcher at the Center for New American Security, an expert think tank.
Syria 'ready' for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and offers help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in his country was improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore them to their original condition.
All the conditions now exist because of the voluntary return of refugees to the countries they had to leave because of terrorism and the sweeping economic decisions that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
Six million others still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they would not receive aid or conditional assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe secured the Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup beating the US team by a final score of 16.5 and 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its foothold when the Danish team captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled almost the entire tournament, hit his tee shot to the water on par-3 of the 16th hole, conceding his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone through the round, becoming one of only four players to ever score 5-0-0 since the format in force in the tournament began in 1979.
American athlete Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Sergio Garcia of Spain became the European with an overall win with a career-high 25.5 points at the tournament.
"I don't usually cry but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have her back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help, Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He gave his responsibility to fellow countryman John Ram who defeated legendary US golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"The amazing pride I feel, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics by one of the best players of all time, having won 14 major titles under Jack Nicklaus alone.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to get a fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was this morning when we were making Europe difficult.
We were fighting.
I'm paying homage to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna reorganize, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're gonna move forward.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be captain.
You should pay your respects.
We lost the game".
Red Tide's latest news: Low concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in Red Tide concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, uneven congestion conditions were reported from areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - signaling a decline in concentrations.
A cluster of Red Tides stretches about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee County.
The clusters can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but at some sites relative to last week.
Red Tide has also been observed in the Pasco region.
Moderate concentrations in or off the coast of the Pinellas region have been reported in the past week, low to high concentrations off the coast of the Hillsborough region, background to high concentrations in the Manatee region, background to high concentrations on or off the coast of the Sarasota region, background to moderate concentrations in the Charlotte region, background to high concentrations on or off the coast of the Lee region, and low concentrations in the Collier region.
