The Welsh Senators were worried about the look of the hood.
Some Senators are disappointed with the proposal that they should change their positions to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
It happened because of a plan to change the name of the Parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
The political spectrum is blocked and Senators are concerned that it will cause ridicule.
A Labour Senator worried that his group would achieve the fate of the Twp and Pwp.
Information for readers living outside Wales: Twp means stupidity in Welsh and pwp means shit.
One Welsh Nationalist MP said the whole group was unhappy and had proposed an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative said his group had a tense stance on the name change, but noticed it was a bit of a dead end to the change from MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of u.
The parliamentary committees are currently enacting legislation introducing a name change and the final decision on what to call the members of the parliament will be, of course, the members' own issue, he said.
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on a proposal that had broad support for what the Parliament called the National Assembly for Wales.
In relation to the Senate's directness issue, the committee supported members of the Welsh Parliament, or WMPs, but the MWP gained the most support from public consultation.
While the Senate seems to be proposing alternatives, efforts to reach a consensus will be a nuisance for Chairwoman Ellen Jones, who is expected to submit a bill to amend the bill within weeks.
The reform bill also included changes to the way the parliament works, including rules on deprivation of Senate seats and the establishment of a committee system.
Senators will be in the middle of a debate on what they'll call the bill.
The Macedonians are voting to change the name of the country.
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the Republic of Macedonia.
The referendum was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which calls its province Macedonia.
Greece has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbors raises territorial issues and has repeatedly refused to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgy Ivanov, who opposes the popular vote to change the name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, popular voters like Prime Minister Zoran Zayef argue that the name change is simply the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
The winter of silence of St. Martin as the church of Harlem Struggle
"Historically, the old people I talked to were bars and churches on every street", said Mr. Adam.
"Today, not both".
He said he couldn't understand the bar disappearing.
"People live their lives differently these days", he says.
"It's not a neighborhood living room that people go to regularly anymore".
For the church, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not stay as leaders expect and that soon they will return to where they started.
He added that the church could be replaced by condominiums with people from the lower classes who would not help the rest of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who live in these condominiums are white", he said, "and that will be the day that these churches close at once, because most people who move into these condominiums are less likely to become members of them".
Both churches were built by white men before Harlem became a metropolitan community, or black metropolis, in 1870, ten years after St. Martin's.
The white patriots moved in the 1930s.
A black worshipper who praised the building had legal ownership.
St. Martin's was led by a black priest under the pastor John Howard Johnson who led a boycott of retailers on 125 Main Street in Harlem and opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
The fire in 1939 caused extensive damage to the building, but as the parishioners of the parish of Mr. Johnson set up a reconstruction plan, they ordered a carriage.
Pastor Johnson's son, Father David Johnson, and St. Martin's successors proudly called the carriage the servant of the poor.
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it a different name: the gift of the harp culture and the irreplaceable historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first solo instrument played by the black musician Dionysius A. Lind, who moved it to a larger organ at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether said that St. Martin had not replaced him.
What's been played at St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom have involved church civil leaders, others have involved bishops.
The parish's administrative body, the Council, is made up of civil leaders. Although the Council was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors who sent the parish, the Council wrote to the parish in July, with the concern that the parish would try to transfer the cost of the parish to the Council.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the parish.
He attacked a 13-year-old kid in California who was diving.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving on Saturday in California, officials said, on the first day of the rafter season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that the boy was diving with a friend for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning and that he heard the boy's cry for help and went to a group to get him out of the water.
Hamel first caught the raptor and thought he was a god, but he realized he was screaming.
I bit you!"
His skull was completely torn, and Camel said he realized that the shark had captured the boy.
"I shouted out to everyone, 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hamel added.
The boy was flown to Rudy Children's Hospital in San Diego and is on the critical list.
The species of the attacking shark has not been identified.
Chief of Human Resources Larry Giles told the media that a shark appeared in the area a few weeks ago, but he didn't think it was a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of the body.
For investigation and safety, authorities blocked access to Swani's Ponto beach from Casablanca, Essinitas, for 48 hours.
Giles said the area is home to more than 135 species of sharks, but most are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans are to enter the UK beauty market.
Sinesbury will be competing against Boots, Superdrug, and Devenhams in the department store style beauty corner where experts are working.
As part of the massive move to the £2.8 billion UK beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and homeware sales are withdrawn, larger beauty corners will be demonstrated in 11 stores nationwide and will be available in more stores next year if successful.
The beauty industry's investment is like a supermarket looking for shelf space once occupied by TV, electronics, and homeware.
Sinesbury said it would order up to 3,000 to double the size of the beauty corner, including the likes of LeBron, Desiree, Twizman, and Dr. Poppy, which is the first of its kind.
Existing brands like Loreal, Mabel, and Butzby will also occupy more space in brand areas similar to those found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket will also re-launch a boutique make-up line, allowing most products to be released as vegan-friendly, which younger consumers prefer.
In addition, the fragrance shop will be opening in two Sainsbury shops: first in Croydon, south London, and second in Selby Oak, Birmingham, at the end of this year.
The change in online shopping and the small amount of food purchased at local conveniences means what more must be done to convince supermarkets to visit people.
Saysbury's chief executive Mike Coop said that because supermarket chains are trying to fight off discounts like Aldina Riddle, which have more services and products other than food, they're going to look more like grocery stores.
Sinesbury has put Argos Outlets in hundreds of stores and introduced a large number of habi-tates, as it bought two chains two years ago. Sinesbury says it has facilitated food sales and made its acquisition more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to clean up its beauty and pharmaceutical department eventually failed.
Sinesbury tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the ty-up ended in a dispute over how to divide the revenue from the pharmacy's stores in the supermarket.
The new strategy will come after Sinesbury sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Lloyd's pharmaceutical chain owner Selecio for £125 million three years ago.
Sainsbury said Lloyd would play a key role in the plan by expanding the scale of luxury skincare brands like La Rossoche and Beach to its four stores.
Says Sinesbury Commercial Director Paul Mills-Hicks, "We've changed the look and feel of the beauty corner to improve the customer experience.
We also brought in specially trained colleagues to provide adware.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient location means we are now in the same place of beauty that can't be blinded to challenging old shopping habits".
After Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million deal, the disgruntled Peter Jones
Dragons Den Stine Peter Jones has been in a hiatus since TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an $11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on his new deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their homeware and malware brand, Truly.
Their business has been likened to the brand cake of Eunice Quintero.
This morning, the 37-year-old host announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon's Den Star Peter Jones, angry at her withdrawal from the lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute, to focus on her massive new deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones admitted to her new deal worth up to £1.5 million at a tense meeting on Tuesday at his corporate headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, which meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their homeware and badges brand trolley.
The business was likened to the brand cake of Euthenes Quint and was close to doubling Willoughby's fortune of about £1,100.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Trulli, Jones flew out of England on a plane to one of his vacation retreats.
According to one source, Truelie was the top priority for Holly.
It would be her long-term future for decades to come.
Her decision shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday. It was almost time to leave.
Marlowe's headquarters has a warehouse full of items for sale".
Experts believe that the departure of this morning's host, one of Britain's most commercially successful stars, will be costly due to the vast product investment and the potential delay of launch, ranging from cushions and early to clothing and homeware.
And that would mean the end of an old friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Cap and Trust in 2016 and the 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
The two couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand adviser for Marks & Spencer and ITV's Canna will replace Anthony McPhatlin as host of CelebrityDate.
A source close to Jones said last night that we would not comment on his business".
"And we fell in love".
He joked about the news media's criticism of someone who commented on whether or not he was a potential president and had such a positive attitude toward North Korean leaders.
Why would President Trump give up so easily?
Trump said in his fake news anchor voice.
"I didn't give up anything".
According to his account, Kim noted that the commissioner was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June, which was a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearization negotiations were suspended.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Li Yong-ho, told world leaders at the UN that at Saturday's general meeting, North Korea did not hear a consensus response from the United States about North Korea's early arms reduction moves.
Instead, he said, the United States is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at continuing pressure.
Trump showed a much more optimistic outlook in his address.
"We're doing well with North Korea", he said.
"We fought a war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
We have a good relationship now".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Chairman Kim have yielded positive results, including completing missile tests, releasing hostages, and returning the remaining U.S. troops home.
And he defended himself against a discriminatory approach that talks about his relationship with Commissioner Kim.
"It's easy to act like a president, but instead of letting 10,000 people out into this crowded arena, we have 200 people standing right here, right in front of the audience", Trump said.
In Indonesia, a tsunami and an earthquake destroyed the island, killing hundreds of people.
I heard stories about the fact that after the Lompoc earthquake, for example, there was no need for nonprofit organizations abroad.
More than 10 percent of the population of Romblok left, but there was no official announcement of the country's personnel needed to receive international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear about not asking for the support of the international community", said Mr. Hachachach.
While the Saberchildren are building a team to Palou, it's not yet clear if foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutofo, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Authority, said Indonesian officials were looking at whether international agencies could be allowed to contribute to relief efforts, in light of the situation in Palu.
Assuming that earthquakes in Indonesia are constant, Indonesia is sadly not prepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, which is not easily found on other coastlines.
Despite the warning's effectiveness, there is a possibility that if Pallu lacks a tsunami warning siren, it will continue to lose its reputation.
At its best, it's difficult to travel between many of Indonesia's islands.
Natural disasters make logistics more complex.
A hospital ship stationed in Romluk to treat the earthquake victims is building a road to Pallu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the backward infrastructure improvements in Indonesia a key focus of his election campaign, and has invested unspending money in roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has made the administration of Jokowi stronger, as he faces next year's election.
Mr. Joko is also facing the pressure of interfaith tensions that remain in Indonesia, where Muslims, mostly Muslims, are embracing a more conservative form of faith.
Christian and Muslim gangs used swords, arrows, arrows and other cruel weapons to fight in the streets, killing more than 1,000 people and displacing thousands.

Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Chelsea in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Sheridan Shakire, who was about 30 yards ahead of Chelsea's goalkeeper, as the team was 1-0 down.
He pushed the ball to his left before shooting in front of the far post.
When we moved toward the upper right corner of the gorge, the ball flew far above the zone.
The ball eventually fell over the jumping Kepa Arissabalaga.
"I tried to get into that position to get the ball right, and players like Shack always play as front-line as possible, so I tried to make myself as much of a time as possible", said Sean Sturridge at Liverpool FC.com.
"I saw Kanté coming, and I touched it, and I didn't think it was going to pass, and I blew it".
After 25 minutes, Chelsea led 1-0 in halftime after scoring from Belgian star Eden Azar.
Before separating from midfield and being strangled by half-power to Liverpool, the Blues striker was passed over to Matteo Kovacic in that match.
Kovacic picked up a quick give and take from midfield.
And then he led Azar to the box and blew a beautiful kite.
Azar ran faster than the defence and finished with a left-half goal, passing Liverpool's Alison Becker at Pa Post.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League qualifying match on Wednesday afternoon at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play VidéoTon in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday afternoon at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is 832.
The Indonesian disaster authority reported on Sunday morning that 832 people died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami.
A large number of people were reportedly lying in the ruins of the building that collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday and a 20-foot wave, official spokesman Sutofo Puruo Ngrogo told a news conference.
Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was covered in ruins.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man for stabbing a woman to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Merseyside Beaconhead this morning.
The 44-year-old's body was found with his body at Grayson Muse on John Street at 7:55 a.m. and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged those in the area who could see or hear to help.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would urge anyone who sees or hears suspicious things in the John Street neighborhood to contact us.
I'm also going to appeal to anyone who may or may not have important information about our investigation, and anyone who may have something on Dashcam, especially taxi drivers".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of the Beaconhead area and was found inside a private property.
Friends who claim to know her this afternoon arrived at the scene this morning to ask where she was found.
Police said they were in the process of directing the victim's immediate family members, and the investigation is ongoing.
A taxi driver from Grayson's Mouse tried to return to his apartment, but the police said no one could enter or leave the building.
When he discovered what had happened, he had nothing to say.
Residents are told that it will take a few hours before they are allowed in.
A police officer heard a man say that the entire district is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the scene.
She repeats the words "It's too horrible".

The statue of Cromwell in the National Assembly is the most recent monument to be hit by a historical marker using a shovel.
Its expulsion may be a poetic definition of his Taliban destruction of many of Britain's cultural and religious monuments, created by his insane Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell League described Mr. Crick's proposal as a "trial to rewrite the history of the Cromwell".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Federation, said: "The current debate over the abolition of statues has been that the Oliver Cromwell statue outside the Palace of Westminster could not be avoided as a target.
The destruction of the statues in the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrongly, Cromwell was sacrificed in the last century by the actions of his ancestor, Thomas.
Sir William Hameau's remarkable Cromwell Revival is evidence of 19th-century opinion and a historical record of a figure that many still believe is worth remembering.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was more recognized in the late 19th century than he is today as a national defender of foreign oppression in the monarchy.
It's a subject of ongoing historical debate as to whether it's a perfectly accurate reproduction.
What's accurate is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our country since then, and Cromwell is a memorable figure representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as a protector of the monarchy are also worthy of praise and commemoration".
A murderous pig drives a Chinese farmer to his death.
Local media reported that a farmer in southwestern China was killed after being attacked by a market pig.
The man, identified only as Saint Quan, was found with a severed vein and dead, covered in blood near us at the pig market in Liufangshi, Guizhou province, Sunday morning South China Post reported.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, China's Qinghai province.
He said he and his cousin went to the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell fifteen pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin saw that he was dead, and found our door open for the next pig.
He told us that there was a large pool of blood in the nest.
According to reports, forensic examinations confirmed that a 550-pound pig had injured and killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were badly damaged in Pitus", said a cousin known as Mr. Zhuyi, according to the Guyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed him entering the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not the property of Wyand or his cousin.
While police were gathering evidence on the scene, the mayor's manager said on the evening news that the pig was trapped to prevent it from attacking people.
According to reports, Whian's family and market management are negotiating a reward for his death.
Rarely, however, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, leaving a man deadly wounded.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer, and this continued until his wife chased the pigs.
After a farmer in Oregon was fed by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were unusually aggressive, but that the taste of blood could make them a mess".
"They're just playing.
They're young, they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt you.
We must have enough respect for pigs. "He said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are causing widespread rainfall in the northwestern United States.
According to daily reports, Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves into the cold ocean off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa is a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 mph as of 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Organia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the atmospheric crust will take shape in the Pacific Ocean and begin to move eastward along the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja Calitonian Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin sending deep tropical moisture northward toward the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, the approaching pressure crust and the interaction of the tropical moisture will create a wide range of heavy rainfall over the southwestern region for several days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, landslides, and desert landslides.
With deep tropical moisture, it will rain from two to three inches an hour nationally, especially in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona.
Rain from 2 to 4 inches is expected in most of the southwest, especially Arizona.
Due to the nature of the tropical rainfall, there is a possibility of a flash flood due to rapidly deteriorating weather.
The advice to risk walking in the desert, threatened by tropical rain, is very bad.
Rainfall can make the river thick and affect the canyon, and thunderstorms can cause tropical, violent winds and mudslides.
The coming weather forecast will bring rainfall to parts of the southern California coastline.
Overall, more than 1.5 inches of rainfall is likely to float and cause flooding.
It will be the first rainfall in the region.
The volcanic tropical storm will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before it becomes more extensive on Monday afternoon and Tuesday.
The rainfall will expand to four corners throughout Tuesday and Wednesday.
In October, the Arctic will be cooler, and the intersection will be extremely high across the United States, but the return line will be warm.
Sometimes this results in extreme temperature changes at short distances.
A great example is the big hot tub in the central United States on Sunday.
There was a temperature range of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Dimoine, Iowa.
For the next few days, the summer rains will continue and expand again.
In many parts of Central and Eastern America, a wide 80° tide is expected to begin in October from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could average 10 degrees laughing on Tuesdays to 80 degrees.
Our long-term weather forecast predicts that temperatures in the eastern United States will likely be above average in early October.
Over 20 million people have seen the audition of Brett Caverno.
More than 20 million people watched an interesting testimony on the CBS television network on Thursday by U.S. Attorney General nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who sued him for sexual harassment in the 1980s, Christine Blaschford.
Meanwhile, a political standoff with the station, which disrupts Friday's regular broadcast, continued, as a consensus was reached by an Arizona senator, Jeff Plec, to investigate the case for the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Caverno had tried to tear her naked while she was drunk at a high school party.
Caberno said he was 100 percent sure that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen's report, more than 20.4 million people are expected to watch it on Friday.
Nielsen was estimating the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other broadcasters such as PBS, C-SPAN, Fox Business Network, did not immediately appear.
Nelson has a bit of a problem with estimating the number of people who normally watch while working.
Given that, it's similar to the number of people watching playoff football or the Academy Awards.
Fox News, which has a strong support for the opinion host, reported that the Fox News Channel was ahead of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers a day on the day of the hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC's viewership was 3.26 million.
CBS has 3.10 million subscribers, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.520,000, Nielsen reported.
There was no interest after the hearing.
Plack was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the Republican Party of Oregon said he would take Caberno's side, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras screaming protesters as he tried to climb the elevator to the Judicial Committee hearing.
His eyes closed for a few minutes after being slapped, and he was shown live on CNN.
"I stand right before you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
You had power when many women were powerless.'"
Plake said his office had issued a statement and said he would have to talk more at the committee hearing before the elevator was closed.
When the Judiciary Committee voted on whether Cabrano should be appointed to the full Senate session, cable and broadcast networks both covered live broadcasting.
But Plack said the FBI had been urged by a minority of Democrats to do so on the condition that they would investigate the charges against Caberno in the state.
Plack was somewhat convinced in a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Hicks of the Democratic Party.
After talks with Hicks and several Senators, Plack made a decision.
Plack's choice had power because it was clear that Republicans would not vote to approve Caberno without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Caverno.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom accused a critic of playing a political game on Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of threatening the country's understanding of her plans to leave the European Union and playing a political game with Britain's future in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Birmingham on 29 September 2018 for a Conservative Party meeting.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, said the proposal that Britain and the EU should each impose tariffs was entirely unjustified and strongly attacked her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit".
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrested Dixon Simpson, suspected of killing an LSU player.
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Dixon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, police said in Baton Rouge.
Officials released video footage of Sims and Simpson fighting, and police said that Sims lost his glasses while fighting.
Police said they acquired the glasses on the scene and found Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to having a fatal gunshot wound to Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Prosecutor's Office released a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Louisiana State Police Defensive Task Force and the Police Science Investigation Institute, which assist in the investigation for the arrest, comprise of Southern University police and local residents.
LSU player coach Joe Aleva thanked the local law enforcement for its tough face and justice implementation.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6-inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Wade's death left the team devastated and in a crush.
"This is something I've always been worried about", said Wade.
The volcano is shedding ash on Mexico City.
Volcanic activity from the Popocatepetal volcano has spread from Mexico's capital to neighboring areas in the south.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned on Saturday that when volcanic activity began in the volcanoes, 183 gases and volcanic material were released over 24 hours, Mexicans would be far from the volcano.
The center observed several large-scale noises and weak earthquakes.
If you look at the photos posted on social media, in cities near Mexico City like Sochi Milco, car windmills were covered in a thin layer of ash.
Geologists have found that the volcano's activity has been intensifying 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in September 2017 shook central Mexico.
The volcano, known as Chongdong Volcano, has been active since 1994.
On the eve of the Independence Day, the police and the Catalan separatists are on the scene.
Protesters for independence took the place of riot suppression police and six were held in Barcelona on Saturday. Thousands of people took part in a rival demonstration to celebrate the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized separatist independence vote.
A group of masked separatists, who were stopped by the repressive police, caused a black dust cloud on the tourist-filled streets, poured eggs and powder paint on the police.
There was a clash with police using a suppression bar to stop the fighting late that day.
For more than a few hours, the united movement, along with the united movement, who chanted "Everlasting Forever", chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive".
Local media reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Despite the fact that Spain has declared independence illegal, the October 1 referendum is still a day of celebration for separatist Catalans.
Although the voter turnout was usually low with anti-secession voters boycotting the vote, voters overwhelmingly chose independence.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in the polling stations of the violent conflict.
Independence activists spend the night outside on Friday to stop a police-supported protest.
The protest was continued but forced to take a different route.
Narcisse Thermes, a 68-year-old electrical engineer who joined his wife in the separatist protests, said he no longer hopes Catalonia can become independent.
"Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw parents crying out for joy to get a vote, but we're stuck right now", he said.
Despite a close victory in the local elections last December, pro-independence Catalan parties have sought to gain momentum this year alongside the best-known leaders who have been jailed for their role in organising a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence, awaiting trial.
Juan Fuig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests with police assistance over the phone, said the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"The point will be more intense", said the knight.
O'Neill Hunqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed for pre-trial detention at the end of last year, announced Saturday that he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European Parliament is a fierce criticism of the decline in democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government has shown us", said Mr. Jung.
LONDON: Men arrested after their homes were ransacked.
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car was continuously broken into a London-Dalley home.
The incident occurred at around 7.30pm on Thursday, British Summer Time, in Ballinagaard Crescent.
Sergeant Bob Flemings said the doors and buildings were damaged.
At some point, the mast may have been fired by a car.
With Menga's one-on-one, Livingston defeats Rangers 1-0 in the first half.
Dolly Menagha's first goal was a victory for Livingston.
Livingston, who was promoted, drove Steven Gerrard to his second defeat of 18 games as manager of the Ibronze club, leaving Rangers in shock.
Dolly Menka's jersey proved the difference when Gary Holt's team took revenge on Hibernian in second place.
Gerald's side has not won the Premier League this season, and will face the Hearts' leaders who are eight points behind next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will be hosting Rapid Bin in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues the unbeaten run of Holt's manager and six-game league-winning streak, who are still suffering defeat after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses the chance to beat the introverted visitors.
Holt's team should have been way ahead of the Rangers before they scored, because of their direct presence that caused them all the problems.
Scott Robinson jumped and went to the front of the hallway, where Alan Lisgove slipped and met Craig Halkitt's head goal and allowed his jump.
The hosts knew they could hug the visitors in a set-piece situation and were willing to let the Rangers play in front of them.
And that was the way to get the decisive goal in.
Rangers allowed free throws and Livingston approached and scored in the middle of the block, helping Menga with a declan gallog and a gap with Robinson.
This meant that Rangers had the ball, but they knew they could not break through the home team's defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not lead much.
Alfredo Morelos got the save from Kelly, but the pattern continued until the second half.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, who moved quickly from another Livingston set play.
While the challenge of the halcyon to replacement player Glenn Middleton and the two penalty kicks made with the handball returned to the back of the leg, Cross continued to come to the Livingston area and continued to go out of the box.
Livingston's analysis of the phenomenon of the eye
BBC Scotland by Tony McCarthy Arena by Alasdair Lamont
The results of Livingston's amazing performance.
To one man, they were outstanding, continuing to exceed expectations at this rate of growth.
Their playing style and organization have changed little since they returned to the top team, but the big ball will have to go back to the Holt who gave the team the ball.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkitt excelled at controlling well-organized defense, and Menga never stopped between the active Conor Goldson and Joe Warell.
But the Rangers were inspired.
As long as they had a good time with Gerald, they dropped that standard well.
Their last ball was once they -- and it was like a weather alarm for the Rangers finding themselves in the middle of the lineup.
Erdogan is welcomed in Cologne.
On Saturday (September 29) when the Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin for a celebration, there was a smile and a blue sky.
It was the last day of a controversial visit to Germany by President Erdogan, who was unwilling to straighten relations between NATO allies.
They had disagreements over issues such as human rights, freedom of expression and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest number of foreign Turks.
Police heard security reasons for stopping the 25,000 people gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up to meet the president nearby.
Hundreds of pro-Erdogan protesters, including a large number of Kurds, also voiced condemnation of Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him.
The confrontation between the two demonstrators reflects the disagreement between the German Turks who hail Erdogan as a hero and those who brand him a dictator.
Traffic accident in Thumford: Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist in London has died in a car crash.
The accident happened around 10:15 a.m. local time in the south-east of Deptford, near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, and the EMT was on the scene, but the man died on the scene.
The accident happened a few months after another cyclist died in a crash in Childers, about a mile from where the accident happened on Saturday.
The London Police Department said police were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were closed, bus routes were set up, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six inmates in the prison were injured
Six prisoners were injured in the riots in a heavily guarded male prison, the correctional office said.
There was a riot at HMP Long Latin Prison in Worcestershire at 09:30 on Sunday, British Summer Time, and it's still going on.
Professional Torneo prison guards are dealing with this riot involving eight prosecutors and one prisoner.
The prisoners were treated for slight facial injuries on the scene.
A correctional agency spokesman said that specially trained prison staff are being deployed to deal with ongoing incidents at HMP Long Latin.
Six of the staff were treated for their injuries.
We don't tolerate the violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be called by the police and imprisoned for longer.
HMP Long Latin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in Britain.
There were reports that the prison was hospitalized after a prisoner was attacked in June.
And in October last year, a riot police officer was called in to deal with a serious riot that was being carried out by employees in a cotton mill.
Hurricane Rosa Phoenix Las Vegas Salt Lake City is threatened by flooding
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it's something that hurricane Rosa, saving energy, could do across the southwestern desert, and it could do with the risk of flash flooding next week.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, Utah, and Utah.
Rosa is expected to land in late-season rain on Monday and head for Phoenix on Tuesday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said on Twitter that only 10 tropical depressions have maintained a tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles outside the Arizona border.
The latest model from the National Hurricane Center predicts 6 inches of rainfall in Mogollon Rim, Arizona, and 2 to 4 inches of rain in other areas.
In other parts of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it's expected to rain one to two inches, and it could rain four inches in total.
Those areas that are not at risk of flash flooding, the rainfall in Rosa, which is drought-stricken, may be fortunate.
Flooding is a very serious concern, but some of this rainfall may be due to the current drought in the southwest.
According to the US Drought Monitor, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, the second-highest risk rating, according to weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa lands on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico and crosses it.
The highest winds on Sunday morning, still a hurricane century, are at 85 miles per hour, and Rosa is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
This storm will be weakened by the cold ocean currents in the Pacific.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening in the era of tropical storms.
There's a lot of rainfall all over Mexico, so there's definitely a risk of flooding.
Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected in northwestern Sonora, Baja California, and up to 10 inches, weather.com said.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico in a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border in a tropical depression early Tuesday morning, then upward through Arizona to southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
The main threat that we're anticipating from the wreckage of the Rosana is heavy rainfall in the deserts of Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern United States, the National Hurricane Center said.
This rainfall is expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and landslides in the desert and mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton: Four suspects charged with murder are being investigated.
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for manslaughter after being found with a 16-year-old wound in Somerset.
The teenager was found at the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, England, at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, British Summer Time.
He was taken to hospital with a mild to moderate stroke.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area in the middle of the night, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The police are investigating whether anyone has any cell phone photo evidence of the events leading up to the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered from the rage and violence of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Caberno is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's outrageous and absurd strategy", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Caverno was suffering from the Democratic Party's anger and anger during his appointment process.
Caverno testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusations made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers decades ago.
Ford testified at the hearing about her allegations.
On Saturday, the president said that the American people saw Caberno's incredible ability and courage.
"Judge Caberno's confirmation vote is a vote to confirm that he is one of the most brilliant people of our time with the best judicial vision and a great legal expert with a great record in public service", he told a crowd in support of West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Cabrano's appointment during the midterm elections, when he spoke about the importance of Republican voting.
"We're eight weeks away from one of the most important votes of our lives.
I wasn't running, but I was really hurrying.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates".
Trump claimed that the Democrats were moving to counter and disrupt.
A senior adviser to the Republican leadership told CNN that the vote on Cabano's nomination, the most important procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, would be expected late on Friday, if not later.
Hundreds of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and a rise in death toll predicted
At least 384 people died when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi, Indonesia, and many people were swept away by huge waves that shattered the beach, officials said on Saturday.
When a six-meter-high wave, which swept away many people and destroyed everything in front of them, struck the coast near the time of the earthquake, hundreds of people gathered on the beaches of the city of Palu on Friday for a celebration.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When the tsunami threat came to the fore, people continued their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, and eventually they became victims, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPM), at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it brought cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on the ground, and before hitting the coastline, it had crossed the damages at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour", said Ngorongoro.
He said some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Pallu.
Aerial photos released by the Disaster Management showed many buildings and shops destroyed, a bridge collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The women shook the city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people in one area.
The Indonesian Institute of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times more than the century of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's landscape, at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have enlarged the size of the tsunami, the statement said.
Nuggoro described the damage as massive, and he said thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels collapsed.
He added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing, and that the bodies of several victims were found lying beneath the ruins of the collapsed building.
Nuggoro said the casualties and damage would be greater as they traveled along the coastline 300 kilometers north of Pallu, called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The communication from East Gala is completely paralyzed without any information, Ngrogo said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that Red Cross staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse", the Red Cross said.
Authorities were accused of not reporting the tsunami that hit Pallu on Saturday, but officials said the wave hit within the time the warning was issued.
Amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building screaming out a wildly loud warning of an approaching tsunami to people on the street below.
The water walls hit the beaches, leaving buildings and cars wiped out in minutes.
Reuters couldn't immediately recognize this scene.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive state of emergency that disrupted communications around Pallu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Military authorities have begun sending relief cargoes to Jakarta and other cities, the official said, but the refugees still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city's airport reopened for humanitarian purposes only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned to visit the refuge in Palu on Sunday.
More than 800 deaths from the Indonesian tsunami.
It's not very good.
The staff of World Vision from Donggala said they were safe to travel to the city of Pallu, where they were fleeing, with a water cannon installed in the courtyard of the office, but they passed through a devastated scene on the way.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's not very good.
When aid organizations saw the grim movement to start disaster management, some complained that knowledgeable foreign aid workers were being prevented from going to Pallu.
Under Indonesian regulations, foreign supplies and human resources can only begin to be provided if the area is declared a national disaster zone.
The announcement has not yet been made.
"It's still a local disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government says yes, this is a national disaster, we can open up to international support, but not yet.
With the second night in Pallu coming after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the families of those still missing and friends hope that their loved ones will be a miracle that will reverse the desperate story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue teams rescued a woman who had been lying under the wreckage for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, has trained two missing paragliding players in preparation for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
And the others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his apprentices.
"As a leader in paragliding, I feel a deep sense of responsibility", he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how the story was told on the parapet after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, and he fatally sent a WhatsApp message to the Palu participants at the beach festival.
His message was not blue check marks, but one grey check mark.
I think it means that the message hasn't been sent.
Thieves are stealing $26,750 while they're filling ATMs in Newport on the Levee.
According to news reports from the Newport Police Department, Brink's employees stole $26,750 while filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levy on Friday morning.
The driver of the car was preparing to open an ATM in the playground and transfer more money, according to a report by Officer Dennis McCarthy.
While he was taking his seat, another man jumped from behind the staff of the Hubble and stole a bag of money that should have been carried.
Witnesses reported seeing several suspects flee the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved.
Anyone with information on their identity can contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Example.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "Officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, was sometimes nicknamed Example, and used that name as the title of his eighth album, which is due out in June.
The change came before the band's performance on Saturday Night Live, which was expected to feature their new album Yandhi.
He says the show's creator is replacing singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for emotional reasons.
In addition to the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him.
"I think that the word 'big boy' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible, the word means 'big boy,'" West said earlier this year, talking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, and this is us.
It's been changed from Kanhai to the one thing, our goodness, our badness, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are".
He's one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known for his variety of things, like Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, but this year, he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
West's former partner, Jay-Z, is also using hyphen or alphabets, or not.
AMLO in Mexico has vowed not to use military force against its citizens.
As the 50th anniversary of the brutal retaliation against students approaches, Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador, at the Plaza de Tlatelolco on Saturday, promised not to use the military to repress Mexican citizens.
On October 2, 1968, in that square, the military launched a peaceful protest, and as the left-wing student movement began to take root throughout Latin America, it killed about 300 people at a time.
Lopez Obrador promised to provide monthly grants to students and support Mexican youth through more open public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are leading the younger generation into criminal organizations.
The U.S. needs to double its AI funding.
As China becomes more active in AI, the United States should double its funding for research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an AI researcher and expert with experience at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
This is a statement that follows a number of publications by various departments of the U.S. government about AI in the context of a lack of AI strategy in the United States.
Meanwhile, China announced a plan last year to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"Given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, and we'll find the next breakthrough in AI", said Liu Li.
The doubling of funding will double the chances of America creating a massive AI performance in the market, Lee said in an interview with CNBCD this week.
Li's book, "Synov AI Superpower: China, Silicon Valley", and "New World Order", was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which is investing in Face++, one of China's most promising AI companies.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon University, he did research on an AI system that beat the highest-ranking Othello player in the United States, and later became the secretary of Microsoft Research and Google's China branch.
Lee knows about previous U.S. government technology competitions, like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and to help identify the next prophet, he asked when the next game would be.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants, she said.
"It's not China that's taking out academic leaders, it's the companies", Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been hiring experts from universities to study AI.
Lee said that immigration policy changes could help strengthen AI development in the United States.
"I think AI PhDs should automatically be granted permanent US citizenship", he said.
The State Council of China announced its next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation, which is funded by the US National Science Foundation and other government agencies, distributes money to US researchers in a small way, but China's academic work is of poor quality, Professor Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage partners in industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it's investing $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
And for NSF, the NSF is investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation to create a National Security Commission on AI has been in the dark for months.
The Macedonians are voting on whether to change the name of the country
Macedonian citizens held a general election on Sunday to change the name of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move to resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that has hampered efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, a province called Macedonia, maintained a position that its northern neighbour's name claimed ownership of Greek territory and was opposed to NATO and EU membership.
The two governments saw a compromise based on the new name proposed in June, but nationalist opponents claim that the name change would weaken the ethnic characteristics that the Slavs were the main population of Macedonia.
President Georgi Ivanov said he would not vote in the general election, and the opposition movement questioned whether the votes could meet the minimum 50 percent required for a national general election to be valid.
The question on the ballot for the general election is: Do you approve of the agreement with Greece and of membership in NATO and the EU?
Supporters of the name change, including Zoran Zaev, claim that it's a price to pay for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to seek membership in organizations like the EU and NATO.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that young people can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us", said the 79-year-old Olga Georgijevska of Skopje, Poland.
It's not legally binding, but they said enough members of Congress would follow the results to confirm the vote.
The name change requires the approval of more than two-thirds of the Congress.
The Central Election Commission said no denial had been reported as of 1 p.m.
But the turnout has stalled at just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary election, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came out to vote for my children, for our position in Europe", said Jose Tanevski, a voter in the capital city of Skopje, 62 years old.
On 30 September 2018, in Strumica, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, voted in a referendum on the change of the Macedonian flag, along with his wife, Zorica, and his son, Dushko, to open the way for NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament in Strumicca, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was holding a small performance in front of a tent set up by the opposition.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them directly, not through the back door", said Kavardakov.
"We're poor, but we have dignity.
If you don't want us to be accepted as Macedonia, you're going to turn your head to other sides like China and Russia and become part of the European-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Jozef said NATO membership would bring more support to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe a large majority of people will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our people are in favour of the EU and NATO", said Joseph after casting his vote.
He said the results of the Qatari Trial would be a confirmation of our future.
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Agency for Polling, shows that 43 percent of the 30 voters who voted for the referendum said they would participate in the national referendum, which is not much more than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of course, 70 percent said they'd vote in favor.
To have a successful referendum, we need another one vote in 50 percent.
The failure of the referendum will be seen as a major breakthrough for pro-Western governments for the first time since they took over in May last year.
The goal is taken by Sergio Aguero of Manchester City, who is handling the entire defence of Brighton for goal.
In a 2-0 win over Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday, Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero quickly overtook the Brighton defenses.
Aguero scored a goal that looked easier than 65 minutes.
This Argentine attacker got his pass in the midfield at the same time as the start of the sequence.
He strangled three of Brighton's defenders, then jumped into the open.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed a defender out of the edge of Brighton's penalty box before he hit a few more times.
Then he found Sterling and passed him to his left.
The English forward used the first touch of the penalty box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right leg to fight Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, and hit the right side of the net.
"I saw Aguero struggling with a foot problem", Pep Guardiola, the Manchester City manager, told reporters.
"We said he'd play 55 minutes, 60 minutes.
And that's what actually happened.
And we were lucky that he scored that moment".
But the one who gave the Sky Blues the first score in that Premier League game was, in fact, Sterling.
And that goal came in 29 minutes.
Archer got the ball from deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a cheerful pass down the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sanne touched several times before Sterling moved to a remote golf post.
The Sky Blue Forward put the ball in the net before it was pulled out of the ball.
City will play against Hoffenheim and Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday at 12:55 PM in the Champions League group stage.
Scherzer wants a game between Spoiler and the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoff contention, there's no reason to start another.
But the most competitive Schurzer wants to take the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there's a playoff chance left for the Rockies, who are one game behind the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, earning at least one wild card spot, but the Rockies are still looking for a way to retain their first regional title.
Even if we play without any success, at least we can get on the pitch with the audience, knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and the other teams will probably be playing the highest level I'll ever face this year.
Why would you want me to compete in a place like that?
The Nationals haven't announced the start of Sunday yet, but I'm told it's probably a reference to Schurzer in that situation.
Schurzer, who is starting 34th, will throw the ball at a bowling session on Thursday, and he will pitch as usual on Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington is 18-7 this season, with a 2.53 defense average and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia.
While talking about the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president indirectly mentioned the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed chief justice.
"Everything we did depends on November.
We're eight weeks away from one of the most important votes of our lives.
This is really, really big, and I'm not running, but I'm really in a hurry, which is why I'm going everywhere to fight for great candidates", he said.
Trump kept saying, "You've seen this horrible, terrible radical Democratic Party, you've seen what's happening right now.
And they decided to use all the means they needed to regain power, and you've seen the evil, the disgust.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to attack to have power and dominance. What they want is power and dominance. We're not going to hand them over".
He said the Democrats are moving to fight back and to stop the interference.
"And you've seen him for the last four days, and he's been so disgusting and cruel and disgusting and unbelievable to the Democrats, and he's called 'Zan.'
He referred to the House Judiciary Committee, citing Senator Diane Feinstein, a Democrat, and the audience heard a huge buzz about her.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you see that document?
Oh, oh, what a mess.
No, no, I'm waiting. It was a really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a national party.
It's an untenable story for those who tell their own stories.
It was almost unsurprising that activists from the local political party Momentum voted to punish me.
In the end, I was the last one to hear from Labour MPs that they weren't welcome, and that all exposed our innermost.
My fellow congresswoman, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was unyieldingly anti-Semitic.
In my case, I was criticized for having a disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn about the disciplinary consent.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe, and ironically, the similar issues that Jeremy had with his former leaders.
On Friday, at the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting, we said, "We want this meeting to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour Party member, that Friday night board meeting was exactly what it was.
Sadly, today, many of the meetings didn't reflect the social fabric, and the promise of a more kind and decent policy of cheating is forgotten, even if it was a beginning.
It's becoming increasingly clear that different views are not accepted in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged by whether the party leadership will accept it.
It started shortly after Jeremy was elected, when colleagues who thought they had a similar political view to me began to expect me to change my mind about national security or the EU's single market, or else I would take a political position that I would never agree with.
Every time I spoke publicly, social media was filled with accusations that I was not allowed to be a member of the Labour Party, that I was not allowed to be a member of the Labour Party, and that I was forced to step down.
And it's not my experience.
In fact, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I made were politically motivated.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who never shy away from the sexual and racial discrimination that they face every day.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current regime is the way that various insults have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week argued that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a major political party, and all the unconvincingly uncoordinated consent or change in the election makes the party even more ambiguous.
I've been told over the last year that if I don't avoid distractions and make too strong of myself, I'm fine.
But that's not what I wanted to get into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, angry at the Thatcher government's indifference to let the entire schoolroom collapse, I have been striving to fight for better public service for those in need.
I have never hidden my political views, including in the last election.
No one in the House has ever been confused about my political stance and the areas where I have conflicts with my current leadership.
To those who started the agreement on Friday, all I can say is that when the country is heading for a Brexit that is hurting the home, industry and public services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy in showing loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But the only message I really want to convey is not to the House of Representatives momentum, but to my constituency alone, whether it's Labour or not, and I'm proud to be able to contribute to you, and no threat of public outcry or political intrigue will stop you from doing what you think is best for all of you.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Going to the top of the air of defeat
The last two attempts were short-lived, but there is no doubt that Air deserves to win the great and exciting Tencent Premiership that day.
Ten of those undefeated men took the lead.
Eventually, he was just as good a defensive player as the better chance that Peter Mulch had to give us all.
We've already finished the test with a match and we still haven't won, so I'm happy", said Kim.
Robyn Christie of the Melos said, "The Chiefs did a good job, they took a better chance than our team did.
Grant Anderson's fourteen-minute try and Fraser Climo's convertible lead the air, but when Scottish captain Rory Hughes got a wild card and the game leaned to Warriors, Melos gave the opportunity and Jason Baggot took the unconverted try.
Climax extended the lead to allow Air to take the penalty, and just before halftime he scored, and then he turned the solo try and saved Air from the crisis with a 17-5 record.
But Melrose started doing well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's try and convertible goal in the back of the net made O points off the freeway.
The game was delayed for a long time by a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was moved to the stretcher, and when the game resumed, Air made a sharp difference in scoring through a try from Stafford McDowall and a convertible goal from Clemson.
Air's captain, Blair Macpherson, was given a Yellow Card at the time, and Melrose, under intense pressure, offered additional personnel in exchange for a convertible of Bruce Colvine's tray.
But back on the home side, and when Struan Hutchinson got a touchdown card for tacking the ballless climate, MacPherson hit the touchdown ahead of Air Maul.
Clemente scored a convertible, and Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's boxing jersey, and Gregor Henry scored again from the reboot after sending the fifth try to the home side.
The star of Still Game seems to be preparing for a new career in the fairy tale industry.
The Steel Game's star, Ford Kieran, appears to be preparing to move into the service business after being named the head of an authorized restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show he co-starred and co-wrote with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last show of the show, and Keirun seems to be preparing for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the manager of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but according to the Scottish Sun, it appears that Keirun was involved in the Glasgow Restoration campaign.
Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that the courts will reopen the road to the Pacific Ocean.
The sailors patrol the base of the sea, which is headquartered in La Paz.
In a public building, there's a sea-colored flag that lifts.
The naval bases from Titicaca to the Amazon have the following inscription:
It's a duty to recover it".
All over Bolivia, surrounded by land, there are still memories of the loss of coastline in the 19th-century resource conflict with Chile, so I long to sail the Pacific once more.
Bolivia is waiting for the International Court of Justice's ruling on October 1st after five years of deliberations, and that hope is likely to peak in decades.
"Bolivia is experiencing a momentum of unity and calm, and of course, we're looking forward to the results", said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's foreign minister.
Many Bolivians across the country will see the International Court of Justice's ruling on the big screen, which is in line with the Bolivian argument that Chile is obliged to negotiate an independent access to the sea for Bolivia after decades of deliberations that have been unconstitutional.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president who is in a contentious race for re-election next year, is also quite dependent on Monday's ruling.
"I'm very close to going back to the Pacific", he said last August.
But some analysts believe that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that doesn't change much.
This Dutch-based UN agency states that it has no power to grant Chile territory, and that it will not decide the outcome of any possible conversation.
The International Court of Justice's ruling was only six months away after the last argument showed that what we heard about this case was not overwhelming.
Far from the cause of Bolivia, we could go back four years.
"The problem of access to the sea is being exploited by the Bolivian administration", Zarate said.
She claimed that Morales' aggressive words were also taking away the favor of the remaining Chileans.
Bolivia and Chile will hold talks at the right time, but it seems very difficult to continue the conversation after this.
Both countries have not sent ambassadors since 1962.
It was surprisingly quick for the former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represented Bolivia in The Hague, to reject the idea that the court's decision was a decision.
On Monday, he told Bolivia that it would open a new perspective on his relationship with Chanchille, bringing an end to a 139-year conflict of opinion, with special opportunities and a win-win.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the ocean as a political tool.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific", he added.
"Judgment is an opportunity to show that we need to overcome the past".
He says North Korea has no nuclear weapons until the United States can trust them.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said that if North Korea can't trust the US government, it will never first disarm its nuclear weapons.
This was said at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to continue to deliver on the pledges made by the leaders of the two countries during the summit in Singapore.
His remarks were conveyed to the United States, where Secretary Mike Pompeo appeared to be re-imagining a nuclear policy that had been in stalemate for more than three months after Kim Jong Un and North Korea's visit to Singapore.
He said that the ongoing sanctions and the U.S. opposition to declaring an end to the Korean War was a blow to the North's ultimate surrender.
The U.S. government is cautious about North Korea agreeing to the declaration unless it makes a significant non-armed move first.
Kim and US President Donald Trump both want a second summit.
But because North Korea sees weapons as the only way to ensure security, there is widespread skepticism about whether North Korea is serious about giving up arms.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim and Trump's second summit.
The Paris fashion show unveils the huge headwear that gets you from the city center on the latest line.
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block out the sun, you don't have to look at anything else.
Designers from Valentino and Tom Browne have unveiled a number of exquisite oversized hats on the eye-catching SS19 collection runway at the Paris Fashion Week.
And this summer, very unrealistic fashionistas have taken to Instagram, and these designers are putting amazing creations on the stage.
The most prominent feature of the Valentino was a badge-colored hat with a wide sash, covered with feathers on the model's head.
Other oversized acne scars were jewel-plated beads, witches, and even pineapples, but they're not designed to make your head pop.
Tom Brown also released a bizarre mask selection, which is the perfect time for Halloween.
Many masks of different colors had stitched lips, and they looked more like a Hannibal lector than an octopus.
One of the pieces looked like a scuba diving kit with a snorkel and a google, and the other one looked like melted ice cream.
And if you're going to continue to be a huge fashion icon, you're in luck.
Style observers predicted that a giant bonnet could reach you from the center.
The special hat was heated on the hill of La Bomba, a large straw hat that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski wore.
The passionate brand has launched a huge creation on the social media platform, following a highly unrealistic hat that became a social media issue, a strawberry beach back that's almost as big as a model in a suitcase.

Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "I expect you'll see a wide hat and a beach-top that arrive in the downtown area next summer, and it's hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories because the designer has had such a huge impact".
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizenship.
Private schools in Scotland are maintaining their academic excellence, and the real attraction is that they have excellent test results in 2018, which means they have improved individual and overall success in sports, art, music, and other fields of endeavor.
Represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), these schools, with more than 30,000 students across Scotland, strive to provide the best services for students and parents.
Private schools are designed to prepare students for adult education and higher education, their chosen careers, and their status as global citizens.
As an educational institution that can plan and implement custom school curricula, we're seeing modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable choice of subjects among schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak in a language that you can hear, it will go into your head".
If you speak in his language, it will be written in his mind".
This is a powerful lesson that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
And from the recent results of this year's tests, we can see that the language ranks first in the league in terms of the highest enrollment rate in an independent school.
68 percent of students who study foreign languages have a high A-rating.
According to data collected from 74 SCIS member schools, 72 percent of students have A's in Mandarin, 72 percent of students who learn German, 69 percent of students who learn French, and 63 percent of students who learn Spanish also have A's.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a necessary skill for children and young people in the future.
Today, language is being used as a subject choice in independent school curricula, and in STEM subjects like science, technology, engineering and math.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of employers blame language skills shortages on their struggles to fill out a form.
So language skills are becoming increasingly essential for young people to prepare for their future careers.
As more job opportunities for the future require language, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever profession you choose, those who learn a second foreign language will have the practical benefit of having this lifelong ability.
When you can communicate directly with people from abroad, the automatic multilingual person will be ahead of the competition.
A 2013 poll by YouGov of over 4,000 British adults found that 75% of them were not conversational enough, and French was the only language that had a two-digit ratio of 15%.
And that's why it's so important to invest in language education for kids today.
Multilingualism, especially in developing countries, will provide better opportunities for children to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, the languages taught in each school will be different.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will focus on teaching languages that are considered most important to the UK in 2020 like Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, along with faculty who are experts in this field, there will always be plenty of languages to choose from within an independent school.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children for anything in the future and provides them with the skills they need to succeed.
There's no denying that language continues to be a very important part of the future of a nation in the global business environment, and that this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication capabilities".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Independent Schools Commission for Scotland.
LeBron), debuted with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The fans' wait to see LeBron James make his first start for the LA Lakers is almost over.
Lakers manager Luke Walton announced that James will be playing in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he's not yet decided how many minutes he'll play.
Walton said on the Lakers' official website, "It's going to be over a minute, it's going to be under 48 minutes".
Mike Trudell, a Lakers reporter, said on Twitter that James appears to be playing for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about the Lakers' pre-season six game schedule.
He said, "You don't need a preseason game at this stage to prepare".
Trump's time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a gang of juvenile rapists tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five meetings of President Trump scheduled next week, including a friendly trip to Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to fill the Supreme Court vacancy reserved, Trump plans to build up support for the upcoming midterm elections, which will put the Republicans at risk of losing control of Congress if they vote in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's West Virginia Wheeling rally is scheduled for 7:00 PM ET this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online and live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to hold this week's hearing of Brett Caverno, the top-ranked candidate for Supreme Court justice, who is being held up for sexual misconduct while the FBI is investigating, postponing the Senate vote for up to a week.
But the one-way goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans gain some power ahead of the November election.
According to Reuters, the Trump campaign's fifth meeting next week is "to empower volunteers and supporters to protect and expand the main areas of the Republican Party's Senate and House of Representatives".
A Trump campaign spokesman, who asked for anonymity, told Reuters News in an interview, "Because congressional control is so important to his presidency, the president will visit as many states as possible during the busy campaign season".
According to the West Virginia Metro News, this rally, which will be held tonight at the Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling, will draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and will be covered by the Pittsburgh press.
This is the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who was left behind in the polls.
According to Reuters, a West Virginia political scientist, Simon Haeder, said, "The fact that the president has to come to give power to the vote is not a good sign for Mauritius".
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the courage to fight to keep hopes of Sunday singles.
It's possible that after three one-way sessions, the Saturday afternoon game of the Fossum needed this Ryder Cup.
The real driver of the momentum is a completely invented sporting concept, but it's a concept that athletes truly believe in, and it doesn't have any more meaning than these competitions.
So where is the momentum now?
Director Jordan Spieth walked in today and said, "They're six points ahead of us, and now they're four, and they're getting a little bit of resilience".
Of course, Europe is ahead by 12 points to four points.
And as Spitz said, Americans feel a little bit of a wind in their pants, and that wind is enough to give them the energy, especially Spitz and Justin Thomas, who not only play together all day, but they each boast four to three points.
Species were deadly from tee to green, and they're leading the way.
The more his round went, the more the celebration screamed, and when he and Thomas were two games into the game, they hit a key part, and they made the game four.
As his cue to lead them to victory in the 15-day game, he shouted out a shout that he believed the American team had not yet withdrawn from the game.
Spears said, "You have to dig deep and worry about your game".
Now all these players are gone.
18 holes make the score.
The only players to score more points than both Spice and Thomas in the last two days is Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but lovely couple in Europe can't be wrong with four to four.
The Camoliwoods were the only couple who didn't watch Saturday afternoon, but they avoided Saturday morning and Friday afternoon and Friday at 9 a.m.
And the flow and the energy flowing to them from this roaring crowd, confirming that they're the winning team on Sunday, and the Le Golf National, will be the most popular player to stop a potential European victory from Fleetwood or Molinaire.
Rather, in different halls, both at the same time.
But the story of the glory of Europe is timeless.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson teamed up with Alex Noren to create a short piece of morning bobsled hero Sergio Garcia.
The Spanish and Swedish players, with a look in the front nine, a look in the front nine, a look in the front nine, a look in the front nine, a look in the back nine, a look in the back nine, a look in the back nine, a look in the back nine, a look in the back nine, a look in the back nine, a look in the back nine, a look in the back nine, a look in the back nine, a look in the back nine, a look in the back nine, a look in the back nine, a look in the back nine, a look in the back nine, a look in the back nine, a look in the back nine, and a look in the two, a look in the two, a look in the nine, a look in the nine, a look in the nine, a look in the nine, a look in the nine, a look in the nine, a look in the nine, a look in the nine, a, a look in the nine, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a. a.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you get out of the hall.
The puzzles and the possom are fun to watch from close range because of the interaction between the players, the suggestions they make, the suggestions they don't make, and the way strategies can change in a moment.
Europe has done better as a team and led the way until the last day, but this game of fiber-optic fiber has shown that some American teams, especially the American side, have the courage to fight what they have been suspecting.
They're ahead of the European 10-6 in the Ryder Cup final.
Europe will be very good in the Ryder Cup final after beating the United States 10-6 in the PBO and Fossum matches on Saturday.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way in this thrill, winning two games against Tiger Woods, who are struggling to add four points to their record so far at Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, overcame the United States in the morning volleyball game to replenish the trophy they took two years ago from Hazeltaine, and won the series 3-1.
The United States won two games at Forsyth, and resisted a lot, but it couldn't keep up.
Jim Furyk's team can keep the trophy if they score eight points in 12 singles games on Sunday.
Although it was the first time Fleetwood had won a four-point lead as a European rookie, he and Molinari, who were nicknamed the Crommelliwoods, became the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four in four straight starts since the breakthrough weekend.
In the PoBowl, they beat Wood and Patrick Reed, and they beat Wood and the American rookie, Bryson Dechambeau, with a much stronger 5&4.
Woods, who started two games back-to-back on Saturday, has occasionally been spectacular, but he's now lost 19 of 29 games in the Bowl and the Fossum, losing seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose took a break for the morning of the Footsolder, then returned to partner Henrik Stenson at the Footsolder game, losing 2-1 to world No. 1 and No. 3 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka.
Despite the cheerful and breathtaking southwest of Paris, Europe didn't have it their way.
Three-time major champions, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, set the American benchmark with two points on Saturday.
They won the Super Bowl by 2 and 1 over the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, then came back and lost the first two holes in the Super Bowl, defeating Paulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3.
Although Furic's team must draw to defend their title, it's only the second team in Ryder Cup history to come back four points behind in a single race.
But after two days of second place, Sunday's reversal seems to be more than that.
North Korea, unilateral disarmament without trust is impossible.
North Korea's foreign minister said Saturday that the continued sanctions on the United Nations are deepening distrust of the United States and that in such a situation, North Korea has no way to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual meeting that North Korea had taken "substantial friendly measures" over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and vowing not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "But the United States doesn't seem to respond to that".
"If we don't have confidence in America, we won't have confidence in our national security, and in that situation, we don't have to unilaterally disarm first".
Lee's foreign ministry remarked on the familiar North Korean complaint about the U.S. resistance to the phased denuclearization of the country, which would be compensated for its gradual measures, but his remarks were significant in that North Korea did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it had in the past.
The Lee Foreign Affairs Prize was awarded last month at the first summit between the US president and North Korean leaders in Singapore, where Kim Jong-un made a statement about his efforts to denuclearize Korea and President Trump's joint pledge to provide security for North Korea.
North Korea has been trying to find an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States also rejected the call to ease the stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
The Foreign Affairs Prize said, "The United States is pushing for denuclearization first, pushing for sanctions to achieve its goals in a forcible way, and even opposing the declaration of martial law".
"The realization that the present can bring us to our knees is the dream of those who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that our suspicion is deepening with the ongoing sanctions".
The Foreign Affairs Prize did not mention the plans for the second summit of Chairman Kim and President Trump, which were highlighted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister emphasized the three-way meeting between Chairman Kim and the authoritarian president over the past five months, adding, "If the party to this denuclearization issue were not the United States, but Korea, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have been in this state of stalemate".
Still, Lee's tone of speech was clearly different from that of last year's UN General Assembly speech in which President Trump declared that North Korea's rocket attack on the US mainland was inevitable after President Kim Jong-un designated it as a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, praised UN Commissioner Kim for his courage this year in taking steps to disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions to be maintained until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said, "It doesn't matter if it's two years, three years, five months".
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should compensate the people for their actions.
But Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, on Tuesday, in the UN Security Council, said, "We must continue to vigorously enforce the security sanctions until we achieve complete and final verified denuclearization".
Anbari has been unanimously tightening sanctions on the DPRK since 2006 to halt funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo said he would visit Pyongyang again next month after meeting with the UN General Assembly on Monday and prepare for a second summit.
Minister Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a smooth one.
He left Pyongyang in July, with progress, but within hours, North Korea accused him of "a failure-like demand".
North Korea, in a meeting with President Idol Mungs, promised that if the United States took "responsive action", it would dismantle its missile and nuclear weapons.
He said Commissioner Kim delivered "compliant" measures in Singapore, including the security measures promised by President Trump and the moves to normalize relations with the United States.
Harvard students take classes to get enough rest.
This year, a new class at Harvard University has allowed all undergraduates to sleep better to fight the increasing culture of caffeine addiction through the use of "onite".
One scholar found that students at world-class universities often lack knowledge of the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed this course, and he believes it's the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And when I finished class, a girl came up to me and said, "Why are you teaching this now that you're in high school?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, and it surprised me", he told The Telegraph in an interview.
This is the first class of the year to show students how good sleep habits help their academic and athletic performance and how important it is to improve overall happiness.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, said that the university found that students were experiencing severe sleep deprivation in the state and decided to introduce this process.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
One section has a picture of the dorm, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, books, and hear about how caffeine and light and exercise affect sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleep routines.
In another chapter, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the campus and the interactive icons make the participants think about their daily lives.
'We know that it won't change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking".
He added that the culture of pride in "snowing at night" still exists, and the ever-increasing pressure on modern technology and students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
He said that sleep deprivation makes the brain feel hungry all the time, and that it should be a secret weapon for students to fight stress, blood, anxiety, and not gain weight.
Raymond So, 19, who is studying chemistry and physical biology in California, helped design this class when Professor Chesley took one of his lectures last year during his freshman year at Harvard University.
He said this class opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a campus-wide course.
The next step is to ask all graduate students to take a similar curriculum before entering a competing institution.
Professor Kaiser advised students to consider setting an alarm when they go to bed and when they wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can cause your cycle rhythms to deviate from normal, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to get Gerard's men down.
When Steven Gerrard lost 1-0 to Dolly Menga in a strike at Livingston, Rangers suffered another bout of long-term depression.
The Ivorks were attempting to record their first victory since a 4-1 win against St Johnstone in February, but the Gary Holt team beat Redbrooks Premier League leader Hart by eight points, only to be defeated by Gerald for the second time in 18 games.
The men were full seven minutes ago, and the lack of lineup for Rangers' inspiration didn't seem to be a level playing field.
The Rangers were down sixth, but Livingston was up third, only to be beaten by the Hibernians in the goal.
And because Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after flying from a distant object, it could have been a bigger problem for Rangers.
Gerald has made eight changes to the side that has been swept in the last year and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was with the Livi 11, who scored the Hart's score last week, and he would have been happy to have his well-punched outfit choking their opponents every time.
The Rangers might have taken over, but Livingston did more when he had the ball.
They passed the first strike of Menga to Scott Pittman and Alan McGregor, but the midfielder had to take his big shot and score in just two minutes.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep-lying friend found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, stabbed him in the back.
The Rangers gained control, but they showed more hope than they believed in the final three.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he should have been fined 15 minutes when he collided with Steven Thomson, but the Steven Thomson referee rooted the appeal from Colombia.
The Rangers scored two touchdowns in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly suffered a neck injury from a head-on and a road-on strike by Lassana Coulibaly's Ovie Ejaria.
Livi's 34 minutes of opening may have been against the game, but no one can deny that they deserve it for their efforts.
This time, the Rangers didn't get the deep Jacobs setpiece.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher scored a goal against Scott Robinson, and he chose Menag for a simple finish and remained calm.
Gerald replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and when the winger in Morelos scored a goal, it was almost instantaneous, but Kelly was impressively run over and stopped.
But Livingston made LISGO and Halcyon take a long pass after a long connection, and they continued to attract the audience to play the kind of game they enjoyed.
Holt could have extended the lead in the final stage, but McGregor stood up well to stop Jacobs before Lisgo headed into the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton, who was in the game, demanded a penalty kick against Jacobs, but Thompson backed out.
The inventor of the Geiger counter.
In a page of the Sunday Morning Chronicle: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and... the day of the birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger eventually developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactive material, an invention that led to a device known as the Geiger Counter.
The Geiger Coefficient, which has since become a center of science, also became a center of popular culture in the 1950 film "Bell of the Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as none other than the Cowboy Scientist:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger calculator used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
And if you put this headphone on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radiation of the mineral".
Evans: "Yeah, it's definitely going to explode!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still exists.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' the malignant cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system how to "see" and kill malignant cells.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize the target of treating malignant cells.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
And they can see and re-inject proteins common to many cancers.
The experimental vaccine has shown promising results for a variety of cancer patients.
One woman who was given this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw that ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This involves extracting immune cells from patients, changing them in the lab to a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cells back into them.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our research suggests that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "promotes the growth of many types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon", explains Professor Birzowski.
A similar approach to how we extract immune cells from patients and target cancer cells has worked for leukemia.
Kanye West, after wearing a MAGA hat and appearing on SNL, started to criticize Trump.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West performed a performance on Saturday Night Live praising President Donald Trump and was fired from the studio after revealing his candidacy for the 2020 election.
That evening, after making "Make America Great Cap" and singing a third song, "Ghost Town", he continued to protest in a rage against the Democratic Party and renewed his support for Trump.
"When I share stories with white people quite a few times, they say, 'How can you like Trump, when he's racist?'
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL started with a drama starring Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee about sexual assault allegations by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's statement was posted on SNS by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with that post.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had a hard time behind the scenes writing in his head.
"They were harassing me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't wear that hat and go outside".
They've been harassing me!
And they say I'm in a place where I'm drowning", said the Washington examiner.
West said, "Do you want to see where the sink is?" and he said, "I'm going to wear my Superman jacket because it means you can't tell me what to do.
I said, "Love yourself".
Variety said his comments had sparked at least two spectator buzzes and that the performances on SNL seemed to be a shock, and one person said, "The whole studio is quiet".
West was later recruited as the successor to singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many people with his play of "I Love It", which was a disease of Perier.
West was supported by Candace Turner, a conservative TPUSA representative, who posted on Twitter, "Thank you to one of the bravest souls: for standing up to this violence".
But talk show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West simply said, "Who is he, that's really cool".
"But I chose not to reward people who think they are embracing and infusing harmful ideas into our society by buying their music or clothes or by supporting their 'art'.
He's free.
We do too".
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "The One Now Officially Known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change their name and follow Didi, also known as Perf Daddy, Perf, and Fiddie.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion, and of course, the legendary Prince of Music, who had died, changed his name to a symbol and then became the artist who was known as Prince.
Charged with murder in the Belfast restaurant shooting.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Balihkamore.
The defendant is due to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
Those charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, is invading the male mouse.
Keith Herrington is best known for his role as John Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones, holding a knife.
But the 31-year-old actor has often challenged the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such roles in movies mean that young boys often feel they have to struggle to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said, "I believe something is wrong", and he questioned how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #Mitu era.
Keith, who recently married Rose Leslie, 31, co-star of Game of Thrones, admitted that he feels "very strongly" about dealing with the issue.
"I personally feel pretty strongly, where did we see the male nudity wrong?" he said.
'In the light of the problem we are seeing now, what have we taught men when we were growing up?'
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for increasing the male sexuality of a male character.
He continued, "What is innate and what have I learned?
What makes young boys feel like they should be men on TV and on the streets?
I think that's one of the biggest problems of our time. How do we change that?
Because obviously, something's wrong with the young people.'
In an interview, he also said that he's done with the Captain and the Horse and that he won't be doing Game of Thrones or a sequel at the end of next summer's series.
Starting in November, Keith will be a part of the true West revival of Sam Shepard, the story of his brother, a filmmaker and thief.
The actor said he thinks meeting his wife Rose recently is the best thing about Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so that drama gave me my future and my family and my life from here", he said.
Rose played Igret, the love interest of Keith's character John Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the basis of a family estate in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases.
China reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, according to the Health Authority.
In the second quarter of 2018, there were about 40,000 new cases.
Most of the new cases were sexually transmitted, and this shows that things are different from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood.
But the Chinese Health Authority said at a conference in Winter that the number of people infected with HIV in this way was almost cut to the ground.
But the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 a year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a hot topic in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was banned in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the conservative values of this country, studies have estimated that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the infections come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the employees leaked the Republican Senators' data, and she's spreading "dangerous lies" and "propaganda".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters accused her staff of posting the personal information of three Republican Senators on Congressman Wikipedia last Saturday.
A Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were being reported by "extremist" experts and websites.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter, "Lies, lies, more brutal lies".
The information was released to include the addresses and phone numbers of members of the U.S. Senate from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, and Mike Lee from Utah, and Orrin Hatch.
The information was reportedly posted online by an unknown person on Thursday on Capitol Hill during a U.S. Senate hearing on allegations of sexual abuse of the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
This leak came after three senators interviewed Caberno.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP addresses that verify the source of the posts were associated with Waters' office, and Hill reported that they had released information about one of Waters' employees.
Waters claimed, "This unfounded claim is completely false and absolutely false".
"My staff members, whose identity, privacy and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false claims, have never been responsible for the leak.
This unfounded claim is completely false and never lies".
Waters' last name was criticized online, and former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer agreed.
"I'm angry at this denial", Flisher wrote.
"This suggests that she has no control over her own power to become a member of parliament.
When someone is criticized for something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They should not resist.
They should not doubt the motives of the accuser.
They need to be calm and calm".
Flasher appeared to be comparing Waters' response to the Democratic criticism of Judge Caverno, who was accused by critics of being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who ran to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
He tweeted, "If it's true, it's a big deal".
Waters said in a statement, "We are warning the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent claims".
"We're going to make sure that the perpetrators are discovered", he added, "and they're going to be destroyed by all my employees and they're going to be held legally responsible for any dangerous behavior".
Johnny English: Strike Review - The infamous Rowan Arkinson spy parody
It's traditional to look for the Brexit crisis in any new film that has a British perspective now, and it seems to apply to the revival of the Disney English action comedy parody franchise that started in 2003 with Disney English and then revived in 2011 with Disney English Ribbon.
Will this self-deprecating joke about how obviously we're garbage be the new export agency of the country?
Anyway, the incompetent, snowy, big-faced, rubbery Johnny English was qualified to create something more novel than anything else, a vast, dramatic creation designed for a region where he had no English-speaking movie fans.
Of course, he's a bit of a clown, with a young appearance as a secret agent, despite his bizarre appearance, and he's a bit of a Mr. Bean, and he's the one who contributed a note to the theme song for the 2012 London Olympics.
He also made a one-off appearance in a now-forgotten Barkley Card TV commercial, which basically made him a traveler and an internationally mysterious person, Arkinson, who confused his identity.
There are a couple of great moments in this new English release.
I liked that Johnny English was hitting his medieval armor and revolving wings on his helmet for a moment and approaching the helicopter.
While Dickinson's talent for physical comedy is apparent, humor feels rather cut off and oddly exaggerated, especially since "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible are now offering comedy content with confidence.
It's kind of like the humor is more about kids than adults, and to me, the perpetual accident of Johnny English is not as creative and focused as Dickinson's cartoon reimagining of a person named Vin.
The permanent thematic premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
By a cyber hacker breaking into a secret British spy web network, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, Kevin Elden was disappointed in this agent, who had a sadly small role.
This is the final nail in the coffin of a prime minister who is already in a complete collapse of political popularity, and who is in a palace, Emma Thompson, who is doing her best as this sub-Teresa May character, but she has little to work with in the script.
Her information counsel tells her that because all active spies are at risk, she should get someone retired back into action.
And that means that while Johnny English himself is employed as a principal at some comfortable facility, he's taking informal lessons on how to become a clown prince.
England is back in the White House for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former assistant, Beau, whom Ben Miller has played again.
Bowe is now married to a young man, a passionate athlete and a miserable cast member who played the role of submarine commander, Vicky Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin, who had misled the Queen's Secret Guard, were forced to return to action when they encountered Olga Kurylenko's beautiful fairy Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the reward is in peril because of the demands of charismatic tech billionaire Jason Volta, who claims to solve the UK's computer problems.
English and Bowe begin their journey of playful play, disguising themselves as waiters, setting fire to luxurious French restaurants, eating the crowd from Bolta's luxury yacht, and making their own dishes when Englishmen try to use virtual reality headsets to get used to the interiors of Bolta's house.
And all the scenes for the final scene were definitely flowing, but so cheerful and glowing about it all, it's like a children's TV.
Pretty decent.
And like other British films, can't the British film industry give Rowan Ackinson a role that really matches his talent?
I deny that the Labour Party is thinking of a plan for the British working four days a week but getting paid five days a week.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is trying to consider a radical plan to see British people working four days a week but getting paid five days a week.
According to reports, the Labour Party hopes that the CEOs will use the savings they've made from the AI revolution to give workers a day's rest.
It's going to see employees enjoy three days of weekends, but still take home the same paycheck.
Sources said that the idea would fit the party's economic agenda and that it would be a plan to give the country a hand for the workers.
The shift to four-day work week was approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: "We expect a policy review to be published before the end of the year.
"It won't be a morning wake-up call, but it's a four-day workweek that's a fitting tribute to the party's approach to economic restructuring that benefits workers and the party's overall industrial strategy".
With the Green Party promising a four-day work week during the 2017 general election, Labour will not be the first to support such a proposal.
But that aspiration is not supported by the whole Labour Party at the moment.
A Labour spokesman said, "Four days a week is not a party policy, it's not considered by the party".
Shadow Cabinet John McDonnell used the Labour Party meeting last week to articulate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was trying to get the power back from the faceless directors and producers in the PBA.
The Shadow Cabinet's plan also means that the Labour government can "pass" on wrongdoing, so the current shareholders of the water company may not get their full stake back.
He also planned to put workers on the company board and set up a comprehensive ownership fund to give employees 10% of the private company stock, so employees could get up to £500 a year in salary.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy, the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation, could change their minds, they say in 60 Minutes.
Brett Kavanaugh: The FBI's investigation into Judge Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination for Chief Justice for at least a week, and questions are being raised as to whether the FBI's investigation could shake up Republican senators and draw their support.
Scott Pelley, 60 Minutes, a reporter for the BBC, asked Sen Sen Sen in an interview on Sunday that he was wondering if John Kennedy and Lynch Graham could find anything to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course", Kennedy said.
I told him I talked to Judge Caverno about going to the jury.
I called him after this, and when the charges were filed, he said, "Did you do that?"
He was stubborn, stubborn, and clear.
But Graham's vote seems to be decisive.
He said that he decided to take on Brett Caverno, and that would require a huge amount of blame.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it, and Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And all the people she nominated couldn't verify it.
I'm 36 years old.
There's nothing new that's changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what have we done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the annual World Citizens Festival, an annual music event featuring incredibly impressive stars who will end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy the event with performers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Day, which began in 2012, expanded the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that seeks to increase the number of people actively fighting poverty and end it.
To get free admission to the event, unless VIP tickets are paid, the concert participants had to complete a series of tasks or volunteer, send emails to representatives around the world, make a phone call, or create other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful have the last 12 years been for Global Citizen to achieve its goals?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts the real way to get people to ask for action, or is it just another example of so-called "criticism" that you feel like you're making a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from supporters and is pushing for other goals.
He said these measures have helped world leaders to announce more than $37 billion worth of commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than 2.5 billion people by 2030.
The group cites 390 commitments and announcements that began with the action in early 2018, of which at least $10 billion has already been spent or funded.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have directly affected some 649 million people worldwide.
One of the key commitments is the UK-based Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and practitioners called "Helping Children Reach Their Full Potential", which pledged $35 million to help Rwanda end the region's malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make the social inequality of nutritional deficiencies a cornerstone of history", said Tracy Ullman, the nutritional power ambassador, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken in the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called the Power of Nutrition that can provide nutritional intervention to five million women and children.
And in response to one of the FAQs on the website that says, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded, "It's going to be a long, hard road, and sometimes we're going to fall or fail.
But like the great civil rights movement and anti-apartheid movement before us, we will win, because together we become stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Jens Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe will perform at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborah Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy as a barrier to Russian energy exports.
As quoted by Washington investigators, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said that Washington could rely on the Navy if needed to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East.
Jinke argued that Russia's intervention in Syria, which is run by a legitimate government at the invitation of the government, is a good example of a new energy market.
He was quoted as saying, "I think the reason they're in the Middle East is to mediate energy, like in southern and eastern Europe".
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
"The United States has the ability to work with our Navy to open up the seafront, block it if necessary, and keep their energy from going to the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to a gathering organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that calls itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared the American approach to Russia and Iran, and he said that Russia and Iran are basically the same.
He referred to Russia as a trick-or-treat for a fossil fuel-dependent economy, and he said, "The economic choice for Iran and Russia is to use and replace fuel somewhat".
This statement comes as the Trump administration is taking on the task of increasing liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Donald Trump, the president of the United States, and officials in the Trump administration, convinced Germany to pull out of the failed Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a Moscow hub.
Russia has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which aims at 11 billion square meters, twice the current pipeline capacity, is a net economic project.
The Kremlin claims that the United States' fierce opposition to the business is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Alexander Novak, the Russian energy minister, said after a meeting with the US energy minister in Moscow in September, "We share the understanding that energy cannot be a tool for pressure, and consumers should be able to choose suppliers".
The U.S. stance sparked a backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the plan.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the German Industrial Association (BDI), has urged the United States to withdraw from EU energy policy and the quantitative agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
Recently, after a meeting between Angela Merkel, the German prime minister, and Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, Dieter Kempf, the president of the German Industrial Association, BDI, said, "There's a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply".
Elizabeth Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, said she would be disappointed if she ran for president in 2020.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has said that if she runs for president after the midterm elections of 25 days, she will "be disappointed".
Warren, a town councillor in Hollywood, Massachusetts, confirmed that she was considering running.
According to Congress, "It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our collapsed government, and women have risen to the top", she said.
"From November 6th, I will be complaining about running for president".
Warren, in his city hall, was evaluating President Donald Trump and saying that Trump is pulling the county in the wrong direction.
She said, "I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy".
Warren has been a vocal critic of the candidates for President Trump and Brett Caverno.
Warren tweeted Friday, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
But a poll released Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters don't think she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center, 58 percent of eligible Massachusetts voters say they should not run for Senate.
32% supported that.
The poll showed that Deval Patrick, the former governor, was more supportive of running for governor, with 38% in favor and 48% against.
Other celebrities who have been discussed about the 2020 election include former vice president George Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will make an official decision by January, according to AP.
Sarah Palin, Donald Trump, from the track track Palin, post-traumatic stress disorder, from the meeting.
Track Paylin, 26, joined in September and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
She said in a speech today in Tulsa, Oklahoma, supporting Donald Trump's candidacy, "I can feel my son's pain, his coming back, I can feel PTSD and other families who feel some of the wounds our soldiers have suffered".
Failin called his arrest "the elephant of the room", and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back a little different, they come back hard, they wonder if their fellow soldiers and air force and all the other branches of the military have any respect for what they have given to our country".
Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, said he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with obstructing reports of domestic violence and drunkenness in possession of a weapon.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are supporting a new legal challenge to the U.S. policy of refusing asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and counties on Friday submitted a court opinion petition to Washington to support refugees who oppose the policy.
The full name of the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August on federal policy is still unknown.
She said that her partner, the gangster, and the sons of the violent organisers, had abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as a country where many American asylum seekers are gang-raped and domestically violent.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the board that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney for the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy ignores state, federal, and international law for 70 years".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be judged on the specific facts and circumstances of their claims, and that state law violates those principles", Friend's court opinion noted.
Lawyers also argued in the lawsuit that immigration denial policies hurt the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
(Jeff Sessions) Attorney General ordered immigration judges in June not to allow asylum for victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence anymore.
Sessions said in a policy statement on June 11 that "people who leave their homelands because of persecution or fear of persecution or political opinion because of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion may be granted asylum".
Asylum was not meant to alleviate all the problems that people around the world face every day, even all the serious problems.
As the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors, the deadly rescue effort in Palu
For survivors, the situation has become more and more serious.
His 35-year-old mother, Lisa Kusuma, said, "I'm very nervous", comforting a young girl who was burned at the stake in a ruined Palu refugee camp.
"An ambulance is bringing the body in.
There's not enough clean water".
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching for the submerged artifacts and trying to get everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overrun with 7.5 magnitude earthquakes.
Some of the injured, including the broken hip, shoulder bones, and the heavily injured Dwight Harris, rested outside the Pallu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors.
He was filled with tears as he remembered the tremendous earthquake shaking the five-story hotel room he had been living with his wife and daughter.
I didn't have time to save myself.
"I think I've been sucked into the debris of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that the family came to this city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then I was silent.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I just want them to die.
He's accusing the US ambassador of harassing China with his advertising.
The US ambassador accused Beijing of using the US media to spread the propaganda a week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in a US newspaper for the mutual benefit of US-China trade.
Donald Trump: The U.S. president last Wednesday mentioned the subsidy paid by China Daily after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections in Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest selling newspaper.
Trump's accusations that China was trying to interfere in the U.S. election have prompted American officials to point out in an interview with Reuters that Washington is the new frontier for pressure on China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, China and the United States are now caught up in a raging trade war that sees each other impose tariffs on their imports.
He said that at the beginning of the trade war, China's retaliatory tariffs were designed to hit state exporters like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party and Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to the United States and the top exporter of Chinese agricultural products, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
In a commentary on Sunday's Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote, "China is now doubling down on bullying by advertising in our own free press".
"The Chinese government is using the tradition of freedom of speech and press that America values by promoting its campaigns and posting paid ads on the Desmoine Register", Brantstad wrote.
He wrote, "On the contrary, in the Beijing press, we will find limited opposition and, given that the media is in the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party, it will not reflect the biased views that the Chinese have about the economic trajectory that they may be concerned about".
He added that he avoided publishing his article "by one of the most influential Chinese newspapers", but he didn't say which.
Republicans, leading the Kavanaugh Debacle, are warning the marginal, analysts,
While many Republican leaders are supporting and defending the incriminating Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh, analysts warn that he will face a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment around this has been so intense, it shows that most Republicans already want to hold a vote.
"Those things are irreversible", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told an article published Saturday in Congress.
Leahur said he doubted that the final major blow to the FBI investigation of Senator Jeff Flake would be enough to drive off angry voters.
"Women will not forget yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow, or even November", said a senior adviser and spokesman for the progressive movement MoveOn, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper, Friday.
On Friday morning, when the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee decided to enforce Caberno's appointment despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters entered the Senate lobby and shouted, "November is coming!" Mike reported.
"The passion and deceit of the Democratic Party is falling out of favor", said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, on a news site.
The Chewans are saying they've already got a high score:
But it was particularly likely to rise among suburban women voters who dislike the president but don't often vote, and among young voters aged 18 to 29".
Even before Ford's public testimony, which detailed allegations of sexual assault against the chief justice candidate, it was analyzed that if Republican lawmakers raped her, there might be a backlash.
According to NBC News, Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, "This is a mess for the Republican Party".
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote, it's not about whether or not Cabrano will be brought to justice, it's about how the Republican Party has handled the issue and how they have treated her", Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities Commission, an organization that helps elect Democratic lawmakers, told the news channel.
But according to Ford and Cabrano, Americans seem to have a bit of a divergence about who to believe.
A new YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents said they definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe Caverno.
And 38% said they thought Cabrano would have lied while testifying, and 30% said he would have lied about Ford.
The Guardian reported that the FBI is investigating charges brought by not only Ford but at least one of the defendants, Deborah Ramirez, following Blake's investigation.
Ford testified last week before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee that Caverno was 17 when he drank and assaulted her.
Ramirez claimed that a Supreme Court candidate exposed his sex to her while attending a party while he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creators of the World Wide Web Plans, Google, and Facebook, are launching a new Internet to take over.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is starting a new business to compete with Facebook, Amazon, Google.
The latest project in this tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access what information.
In a solo interview with Fast Company, Barnes Lee joked that Inrupt's intent was "world domination".
He said, "We have to do it now.
"This is a historic moment".
This app uses Solid's technology to help people create their own personal online data warehouse or POD.
This can include a contact list, a task list, a schedule management, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in the same browser at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data storage is that what kind of information you can access is entirely up to the user.
The company calls this "personal authorization through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and the right technology to help everyone use Solid products.
The company now consists of a security platform that Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM have acquired, some of the developers on the ground who have signed up to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can use the tools available on the Inrupt website to create their own distributed apps.
Berners-Lee and his team told Facebook and Google that they're not talking about whether or not they're going to implement a complete change that will completely upgrade all their business models overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission".
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Burns Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web built on commercial energy and Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over pure neutrality.
Even as we start Inrupt, Barnes Lee will be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Memorial to the Victorian Crusaders of World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to win as a fighter in the Victorian Crusade during the First World War was celebrated in his hometown for over a century.
Lieutenant Bernard Van was rewarded for his attacks on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper, and he had no idea he had been awarded the highest order of the British Army.
At a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled the memorial.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this monument reveals exactly 100 years later about his grandfather's career as a winner, and that it was a "divine symbol".
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Van led his squadron across the Canal de Saint-Quentin, "with heavy fog and concentrated fire from cannons and machine guns".
He later rushed up the gunboat, led the line forward as "the greatest warrior", then headed for the battlefield, knocking down three of the detachments.
Lieutenant Van was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said, "I know that my grandfather's behavior is never going to be followed, but it's trivial".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also set fire to the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said, "It's a great honor to be part of the parade parade", and added, "The courage of a true hero is proven by the support that many people have received".
MMA fans who spent the night watching Bellator 206, instead of getting Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you've been up all night watching the full-fledged Bellator 206, but you've been denied access to the main event.
The San Jose program had 13 matches, including six on the main card, and was broadcast live overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., as Gerard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, British viewers were shocked to see the news change to Peppa Pig.
Some were not inspired, especially after waking up early for the game.
One Twitter fan described the transition to children's comics as "a kind of sick joke".
When asked about the broadcast, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said, "It's not appropriate at 6 a.m. to turn this content into a children's program, but it's government regulation".
Peppa pig, what's that?
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said he'd plan his schedule to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, we might be able to solve it", said Cocker.
"But it's Sunday morning at six o'clock, and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday, their time, Monday, our time.
But we're studying it.
Believe me, when that changed, a lot of characters came and went, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, and we thought it was a technical flaw.
But it wasn't, it was the government's problem.
I can promise you that next time, that won't happen.
We're going to cut it down to five games instead of six games as usual, and we're trying to offer too much to the fans, and we just went over it.
It's an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley felt he was "outstanding" about sex.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
He said that he didn't realize that "everyone is not like me" until he went to high school.
Speaking about the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs gift from Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke boldly about gay rights to give others a little bit of hope.
He also said that being a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the longtime host of the show, took a few months off due to illness.
When she was cast in Laverne's first program, Daley said, "I felt like I grew up a little less than everyone else because I didn't like girls socially.
He said, "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than that, feeling different, were the real things that gave me the strength and the courage to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was a jackass, a jackass, and he said that when he finally found out about his sexuality, he didn't let everyone down.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a famous LGBT athlete and used his performance at this year's Australian Open to call on more countries not to punish homosexuality.
He said he was lucky to be able to live in the open without a wave and he said that because he wanted to give others a little bit of hope, he said that he was very free.
Three-time World Cup winner Dustin Lance Black, an American filmmaker he met in 2013, said he was "amazed" to fall in love with a man.
And she said that she married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but the age difference was never a problem.
"When he went through so much at such a young age", he said, "when he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later", he said, "it was hard to find anyone with a similar condition".
The couple became parents to their son, Robert Ray Black, last June, and they said that Daley had changed his "overall outlook".
He said, "If you asked me last year, it was 'You should win a gold medal.'"
There's something bigger than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at age 40.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they still had a London ticket for 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'My dad can't be in the front row,'" he said.
He was holding his hand while he was breathing, and it was only after he actually stopped breathing that I admitted that he wasn't a monkey.
The following year, she competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I realized that this is what I've been dreaming of all my life, that I'm going to go diving in front of my home crowd at the Olympics, and I don't think I'm in a better mood than this", he said.
It also inspired his first song, Proud by Heather Small, which inspired him to choose and still make him feel good about the gymnastics before the Olympics.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
The condition is bad at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson of America set a record for the 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he'll have to turn his foam around to avoid becoming an unfortunate double-digit.
Mickelson played his 12th game of the biennial tournament, and was replaced by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday with a sagus and a fosum.
Instead of being at the center of that action, as he has often been for America, the five-time major winner spent a day between being a cheerleader and working on the pitch to figure out what would help him.
The 48-year-old, who has never had the most straightforward driver in his prime, is not ideal for the tight Le Golf National course, where long laps punish daily wrong turns.
And if the course itself isn't overwhelming, Mickelson will take on the newly-elected Tommy Fleetwood and the current British Open champion Francesco Molinari to win all four games this week in the ninth game on Sunday.
If the Americans start 12 games fast and are four points behind, then Mickelson's game could be absolutely important.
Furic couldn't say much else, but he showed confidence in his man.
Furic said, "He understood the role he was playing today, he tapped me on the back, he looked around my arm, and he said he'd be ready tomorrow".
"He's a very self-confident person.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's added so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably wouldn't have imagined him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it was solved, and that's how we thought we should go.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.
Mickelson is about to surpass Nick Faldo's record for the Ryder Cup, set on Sunday.
It could mean the end of his Ryder Cup career, which is not at all necessary for the height of his personal record.
Mickelson is 18 wins, 20 losses, and 7 1/2 innings, but Furich said his presence brought a little bit of a downside to the team.
"He's funny, funny, smart, likes to play games with people, and he's a great guy in the team room", he explained.
I think it was fun that the young players fed him a room this week.
He offers more than just playing.
I know that the great leader, the European leader, Thomas Bjorn, is about to disappear.
European captain Thomas Violen has learned from experience that a big lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup to singles can easily turn into an uncomfortable climb.
Dane made his debut in a game at Valderrama in 1997, when a team led by Seve Ballesteros led by Seve Ballesteros led by five points ahead of the Americans, but narrowly missed the finish line with the narrowest scoring margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
You keep reminding us that we had a big lead at Valdemar, we had a big lead at Brooklyn, we lost, and we had a big lead at Valdemar, we won, but we just won.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You're going to be completely bored tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you figure it out.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I'm always focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we know so well what's on the other side, and that's the greatest players in the world.
Vijorn was pleased with how his players played on the tough golf course, and he added: "We're never going to get any better than this.
Tomorrow is someone else.
Tomorrow is a personal show, but it's a little different.
It's good to be with your partner when things are good, but when you go out alone, you get a test to make sure you're playing your golf at your best.
That's the message we have to send to the players, that we're going to do our best tomorrow.
Now, leaving his partner behind, he has to go get the best out of himself.
Unlike Viorne, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will find his players to do better individually as an exceptional partner, with Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have only three points from four points.
Furich himself was in the final round of the big game, after being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, where Europe took the miracle of the Chummedina and became the loser.
He said, "I remember every fucking word I said".
There are 12 big games tomorrow, and you want to start as fast as you did in Medina, as you did in Brooklyn?
When that momentum moves in one direction, it puts a lot of strain on the midfield.
We lined up and we sent the men out in a way that felt like we could do some magic tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of facing Rory McIlroy in the first round, and European players like Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter joined him in the first half.
Viorne said about the singles title, "I think I've got it all covered, I've followed this order".
The new German armoured carrier is back playing
The German Navy's latest fleet was commissioned in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War-era fleet, but due to the flawed system and snow-capped costs, it will not reach the site until at least next year, local media reported.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesman, the approval of the newly-built Freigate-class vessel, the Rheinland-Pfalz-Street, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but after a painful delivery, problems plagued the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class battleships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It's also expected to include some stealth technology, including powerful artillery, air-to-air and surface-to-air missile systems, radar reduction, infrared, sound signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, which means that the latest freighter can be deployed at the home port for up to two years.
But the continued delay in allowing Germany to deploy power overseas means that the state-of-the-art military will be obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit said.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was the subject of a public debate last year when the German Navy formally refused to board the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had delivered a ship to the docks after it had been delivered.
Little is known about the background of the return, but the German press has often cited critical hardware and software flaws that made the battleship a weapon when it was deployed.
The Baden-Württemberg class ships would be operated by about 120 sailors, only half the manpower of the old Bremen class, so the software flaws were particularly important.
It also revealed that the ship was dramatically overweight, so its performance was reduced and the Navy's additional capabilities for future upgrades were limited.
The 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz was estimated to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the hardware flaws, the pricing for the entire project, including crew training, is also a problem.
That's up from $2.2 billion per second to $3.3 billion.
In light of recent warnings that the German navy is declining, the most recent issues of capturing the most recent targets are particularly important.
Earlier this year, the German parliamentary defence commissioner, Hans-Peter Bartels, admitted that the Navy was actually "exhausting the traps that could be deployed".
The official said that the problem was burning like a snowball over time because the old ships were dismantled but no replacement ships were provided.
He said that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had the ability to join the Navy.
The National Trust has been investigating the mystery of the bat.
A new study is being done in a private area in the Scottish Highlands, and it aims to shed light on how bats use this landscape to hunt prey.
I hope this discovery will help us to re-examine the behavior of unique flying mammals and guide future conservation efforts.
The study, by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the brown long-eared bats and Daubento bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, as well as the common soap and soap pipistrels.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also be conducting a mobile survey using a mobile detector.
Expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bats and what species are doing.
They'll create habitat maps and reports that will give detailed landscapes of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat is most important to bats and how it is used by each species.
This information will help us determine the benefits of habitat management, such as pasture and how best to maintain the forest for bats and other related species.
The number of bats across Scotland and England has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect deposits and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be dangerous, because this can cause not only the chemical processing of the wing paper and building materials, but also the attack of pet cats.
The bats are not actually blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location technology to pinpoint exactly which bugs and obstacles are on the flight path.
NTS, which manages over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land, takes bats very seriously.
Ten skilled professionals conduct regular investigations and tests, sometimes rescue operations.
The group has designated a special bat protection area for the first time in Scotland, at Thurb Angle in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the 10 species of bats currently inhabiting Scotland are inhabiting the area.
According to David Thompson, the owner of the property, the property is a very ideal habitat for bats.
And David also said, "There's a very good area for bats in Surrey".
"There's an old building, a pine tree, and everything you need for a bat ritual.
But there's still so much we don't know about bats, and while we're protecting bats in this area and other areas, we're going to understand a lot of what's needed to make bats breed".
David stressed that it is important to check the requirements before managing a bat habitat, as if one bat breeding site were accidentally destroyed, it could kill up to 400 females and young bats, and the resulting extinction of the local bats.
Currently bats are protected and the act of killing, harassing or disturbing bats, as well as destroying breeding grounds, is legally prohibited.
Elizabeth Farrell, who works for the Scottish Bat Protection Agency, asked her to take an active part in bat protection.
"We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know how the various species that live in Scotland thrive", Perell said.
Honolulu, denies sexual assault allegations and will file a lawsuit against a German magazine through his lawyer.
Cristiano Ronaldo has denied the allegations of sexual assault against him as "fake news" that "relatives manipulated to use their name to gain fame".
The defendants plan to sue German news magazine Schpiegel, who reported his sexual assault allegations.
Portuguese and Juventus attacker Honolulu was accused of sexually assaulting American Katharine Major in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to a report by the Spiegel party on Friday, Ronaldo demanded the silence of the woman after having forced sexual intercourse and paid $375,000.
Hours after the allegations of sexual assault were reported, Honadu, 33, denied the allegations of sexual assault to his 142 million followers via Instagram live broadcast.
"No, it's not true.
Today's news is completely fake news", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner, Horvaldo, looking at the camera.
"They're trying to make a name for themselves with my name.
It's not a new thing.
I'm trying to make a name for myself and make a name for myself, but journalists are always trying to get something that's going to be a big issue.
I'm very happy and everything is going smoothly".
According to Reuters, the Honolulu lawyer said he was accused of "unwelcome reports that violate the private sphere" and of "reporting sexual assault allegations against Schpiegel".
According to Honolulu's lawyer Christian Serts, "This is one of the worst cases of personal rights violations in recent years, and Honolulu is seeking damages in the amount of moral damage and serious personal rights violations".
The sexual assault allegations allegedly occurred in June 2009 in the suite of the Las Vegas Palm Hotel.
According to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada, Honolulu and Mayorca met at a nightclub and climbed into a hotel room where Honolulu was staying.
According to Mayorca, Honolulu kneels after the sexual assault and says he is "99% good" and "1% bad" because he did it.
According to the documents submitted, Honolulu admitted to having sex with Majorga but claimed it was by consensus.
Majorga went to the police station to report the sexual assault and film the wounded in the hospital, but said she was "scared of retaliation" and "fear of being publicly disgraced" and agreed to negotiate later.
Mayorka, now 34, said she wanted to cancel the deal because she had suffered ongoing mental trauma from sexual assault.
Ronaldo was ahead of Real Madrid's transfer from Manchester United at the time of the sexual assault allegations, and this summer he was transferred to powerful Italian side Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: Britain, the withdrawal of car manufacturers, you'll regret.
UK Industry Minister Greg Clark noted that the UK industry crisis, which has been a leading player in the automotive industry since Brexit, will be a wake-up call and "will be left to regret".
A Toyota official also told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without any agreement, production at its plant in Barnstone near Derby will be temporarily halted, with Minister Clark raising his "voice".
"We need to come up with a resolution", Clark said.
According to Japanese automakers, a no-deal Brexit could result in delays in crossing the border and job losses.
The Bernaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Oris and Avensis, exported 90 percent of the 150,000 cars produced last year to EU member states.
"If Britain signs a Brexit at the end of March, we can only stop production", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director at Bernstone.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and others, have also expressed concern about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade will be conducted.
For example, a BMW official said that the mini-factory in Oxford would be closed next month after Brexit.
If we look at the announcements of car manufacturers, we are deeply concerned that if Brexit is passed without agreement, there will be huge gaps in the supply chain.
Toyota's production line is not stacking parts and making vehicles, but is taking the ordering method at the time, so the parts needed to produce the ordered cars arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU member states.
If Britain does not agree on a deal on March 29, it will have a problem with parts crossing the border, leading to delays and shortages of parts.
A factory official said production would be halted as it was impossible to store more than a day's inventory at the Toyota plant in Derbyshire.
Secretary-General Clarke noted that when Theresa May plans for post-EU relations, "we need to think specifically about avoiding unnecessary verification procedures in the national economy".
"There is a desperate need for a consensus, and not only the success that is in front of us right now, but the opportunity that Brexit brings, we need to create the best consensus", said Minister Clark on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Given the concerns not only of Toyota but also of other carmakers, we should be able to ensure that the supply chain structure that we have been successful with so far is sure to continue in the future".
Toyota has made it difficult to predict how long production will be halted, and warns that in the long run, additional costs will reduce production competitiveness and jobs.
Peter Sowalis, a 24-year-old assistant to the chief of staff at Bernstone, said, "My experience shows that jobs that were once lost have never been restored.
A government spokesman stressed that "they will implement a precise and credible plan to better establish relations with the EU in the future".
According to a White House statement, President Trump will postpone his meeting with Secretary Rosenstern again.
A White House spokesman said on Sunday that the meeting with President Donald Trump and Justice Department Deputy Rod Rod Rosenstein, a sensitive issue as the hearing of Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, would be "one week longer postponed".
Chancellor Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Robert Mueller, a special investigator who is conducting an investigation into Russian election intervention, Trump's support for Russia's relationship with the country, and the possibility that the president could impede the implementation of the post-war definition.
In the US political arena, rumors have been raging for months about whether Trump's impeachment of the Attorney General would make it impossible for an independent investigation into the Mueller Special Investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Vice President Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a hearing aid to record conversations with President Trump and the possibility of impeaching President Trump under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report was true.
Last Monday, Rosenstein went to the White House, amid reports of his resignation.
Instead of resigning, he announced that he would meet with Trump at a United Nations conference in New York on Thursday.
Trump has stated that he "prefers not to fire" Rosenstein, and postponed the meeting so that it would not conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Christine Blaise Ford, one of the women who accused Kavernov of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the Caverno sexual assault for a week and postponed the full Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders Trump, a spokeswoman for Fox News, appeared on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, Sanders said, "The meeting is not scheduled, and it could be this week, but it could be postponed in the next few years, given all the things that are currently going on in the Supreme Court.
But the White House will continue to consider the situation and will keep the press informed of the latest developments".
Sanders' spokesman has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10, so some journalists may have a reaction.
So let's ask the host, Chris Wills, why.
Sanders didn't like the briefing because he hated the "attraction" of TV reporters, but he said, "I'm not against the fact that it's an act of attraction".
He hinted that there will be more opportunities for President Trump and media journalists to meet in person.
He also added, "Unlike the previous president who had a formal question and answer session, President Trump is going to be open about the issue", and without providing any specific evidence, he said, "We're looking at the numbers".
And I'm going to get a press briefing soon, and I'm going to say, "Wouldn't it be much better if journalists had the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly for me?
The White House is trying to get a conversation opportunity often, and it's actually had a conversation chapter in the last few weeks, and now even in press briefings, you can talk to the president of the United States directly".
President Trump has been questioned periodically when he leaves the White House, goes to an open session with his current staff, or has a press conference with his top aides.
It's rare to have a press conference alone.
In New York this week, President Trump may be freely explaining why he attended the Baza meeting before the press.
The Minister of Health, NHS Scotland, is sending a letter to EU workers about Brexit fear!
The Health Minister wrote a letter of thanks to the NHS Scotland's EU workers and wished them to continue working after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has decided to reimburse the costs of applying for settlement status for EU citizens already working in the public service sector.
The letter said: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU, which have been in a temporary state of disengagement for the summer, are ongoing and will be able to decide on the issues as scheduled in Oleg.
But the UK government is also preparing for a Brexit without a deal.
I know you're feeling very insecure.
So I would like to thank all the workers, regardless of nationality, once again for their hard work.
Thanks to the valuable experience and technology of our colleagues from the EU and beyond, we have improved the quality of healthcare services and provided more benefits to patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your depository and we hope you will continue to live there".
Christian Abercrombie, emergency surgery for a head injury!
Tennessee State University Tiger team linebacker Christian Abercrombie was placed on the emergency medical list with a knee injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
The head coach at Tennessee State University, Rod Leed, told reporters he suffered a hip injury just before mid-hour break.
"Christian walked down the line and fell down", Reed added.
Before being loaded by a trainer and medical personnel on the sideline, Abercrombie was put on an oxygen mask and taken to the hospital for further examination.
A Tennessee State University official told Chris Harris at WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that he had completed surgery at the Abercrombie Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "we have not yet heard details about the type of injury or the route", and that Tennessee State University is tracking when the injury occurred.
After his first season as a sophomore athlete, Abercrombie transferred to Tennessee State University in Illinois.
He took five tackles before stopping the game and scored a season-high 18 tackles.
The UK government, foreigners, are charging higher taxes on property purchases.
Under the newly revised Tory policy, additional taxation will be levied on foreign investors who buy real estate in the UK and will be used by UK homeless people.
This decision will attract young voters and make the weaker Corbyn a dancer.
The tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance is raising £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign investors will be charged a higher real estate tax if they buy property in the UK and the additional amount will be used to help the homeless.
Through these moves, they are promising cheaper housing supplies, trying to curb the weakening of Jeremy Corbyn, who is supported by young voters, and attracting high-income voters.
The additional tax collectors are private investors and institutional investors who do not pay taxes to the UK government, and the funds collected will be used to solve the problem of homelessness.
If a single-family or tenant purchases a home for rent two years ago, the current tax rate is increased to 3% of the current tax, including the imposition of higher taxes.
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect 120 million pounds more annually through this measure.
Foreign investors who do not reside in the UK are buying around 13% of London's New Town properties, causing a house price impression.
Since foreign investors spend most of their time abroad, many wealthy areas, especially the capital, are becoming "ghost towns".
This policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson announced that he would drastically reduce the tax rate on first-time home purchases by young people.
He accused the big companies of increasing property prices because they are clutching up without development after buying land, and urged the prime minister to lift the sanctions on cheap housing to fix the "broken UK housing market".
Coffin has been launching groundbreaking housing reforms such as rental adjustments and the end of the housing shortage.
I also want to give the commission more authority to build new homes.
In this regard, the mayor said, "Last year, I said, I'm going to revive the British dream that the new generation should have a better life guaranteed.
This means that soon, we're going to fix the broken housing market.
The British government is open to all those who live, work and make deposits in the UK.
But it's not right for private investors or foreign corporate investors who don't live in the UK to easily buy real estate and make it difficult for hardworking British citizens to buy a home.
The dream of home ownership is getting farther and farther away, and more people are asking for sleep in a bad environment".
Jack Ross, the ultimate goal is to be the head coach of Scotland.
Jack Ross, who was appointed manager of Sunderland, said his "ultimate goal" was to become Scotland manager at the right time.
The 42-year-old Scottish manager Ross is delighted to have promoted the North-East club, which is currently in first place in the First Division and third in the Three-point division.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
Director Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland Sports Sound, "I wanted to play for my country as a player.
But I was a big player and I couldn't go up anymore".
"I grew up watching my father play for Scotland in Hampton as a child, and there was always something that attracted me.
Running a club successfully is the only way to seize the opportunity".
Prior to Ross, Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardise, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyette, and Paul De Canio directed Sunderland.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he could follow Ross without fear, who had successfully led the club to relegation from Bansley and Gunswick Town.
"My goal now is to get this club back into the Premier League.
"It's a good thing that we're in the Premier League, given the structure and facilities of this club".
"It's not easy to get back in the Premier League, but I think I'm the only one who can say that I've brought the club back to the top".
Ross was assistant manager at Dumbledore, and after serving as Hart's coaching staff for 15 months, he was manager for only three years.
Alloa then helped prevent him from being relegated to the third division and led St Mirren, which was in relegation crisis, to the championship win the following season.
Ross, who has spent his career at the academies of Clyde, Hartlepool, Fork, St Mirren and Hamilton, said he was more comfortable than ever.
And I remember when I was playing Alloa, and I said, "That was a real turning point".
"I honestly believed that managing was more appropriate than playing the game.
It might seem strange to me to be moving, playing pretty well, living pretty decent lives, and having the honor that it deserves.
But it was so hard to play.
I had to do a lot of things every week.
I felt a lot of stress and pressure every time I was in the game, so I thought management would be more appropriate for me.
I've always wanted to be an administrator, but I feel most comfortable doing what I do best when I'm a grown-up".
The full interview with SportsSound on Friday, September 30, can be heard on Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 (UK Summer Time).
The poll found that Saturday afternoon at 5:30 was the best time to drink a pint.
While the British pubs were increasingly supportive of the trend, franchised restaurants declined in sales.
According to statistics, pubs and bars saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July, while food stores fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, the CGA business consultant who drew up the figures, said, "The weather kept getting hot and the British team was promoting beyond expectations at the World Cup, and sales in July showed a similar pattern to sales in June, but the food stalls were down.
The sales of restaurants fell 1.8 percent in June, and they fell even more in July.
So far, the mainstream pub, Pernambuco, has seen its best-ever rise in retail sales, while the restaurant sales have fallen.
The food-selling pub doesn't have the same classics as the food-shop, but it's not as old as the restaurant.
People want to have a light drink.
This month, mainstream sales across the pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent and food sales fell by 3 percent".
Paul Newman, RSM Reader and Consumer Analyst, said, "We're going to follow this trend from April and expect this to continue.
Weather, along with important social events and sporting events, are the biggest factors that affect the outdoor industry's revenue.
It is clear that restaurants will continue to struggle and the cost of the restaurant is increasingly fueled by a 4.8% decline in sales.
The storm, which has been a deadly blow to the food business, will soon tell us whether the storm will hit the school in August and increase sales as it has been".
And the newly opened stores, the total sales of the pubs and restaurants in July were 2.7 percent, which is delaying the opening of new stores.
Copper Pitch Tracker, which monitors sales across the UK's pub, bar and restaurant sectors, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, totaling over £9 billion, to set industry benchmarks.
One in five kids has a hidden social media account.
A survey found that at least one in five children aged 11 to 15 has a hidden social media account with their parents and teachers.
And we conducted a survey of 20,000 high school students, and we found that there's an increase in fake Instagram pages.
Fears are growing that sexual content is being published through the news.
20% of students said they have a Facebook account that they show their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, said they had a hidden social media account that adults kept.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students found that the number of students sharing photos on Instagram with a "fake" Instagram account is rising rapidly.
Fears are growing that sexual content is being published through the news.
20% of students have a younger "master" account that their parents are satisfied with, and on the other hand, they have a private private account.
One mother accidentally saw her 13-year-old daughter on a secret site asking other teenagers to "rape" her.
A study by the UK's Digital Awareness and Independent Schools organisation HMC (Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) found that 40% of students aged 11 to 18 have two accounts, half of whom admitted to having a secret account.
Mike Buchanan, HMC's director, said, "The fact that many teens are trying to have their own space online that parents and teachers can't find adds to the anxiety".
I'm going to speak for the "Doctor of the Athletes" at the Scottish Athletic Council.
Eylind Doyle was elected by the Scottish Athletic Council as a non-executive director for the annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most awarded athlete, and President Ian Beatty sees this appointment as a good opportunity for Doyle to fully leverage the vast experience he has gained in international competition over the past decade.
"Aylward is a highly respected figure in the athletic community in Scotland and England, of course, and I believe that joining the committee will bring more benefits to athletes now", added President Beatty.
Doyle said, "I'll be happy to deliver the doctors to the players and I hope you can contribute to the development of Scottish sport and even give me a little help".
An American who won two gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and is now a BBC expert, was forced to retire because of a stroke that was not seen as a permanent brain hemorrhage.
He tweeted, "I had a brain scan a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor said that it's only a matter of time before we know how much he can recover.
It was really hard, but I had to fully recover and learn to walk again. Today I'm going to do agility training.
Thank you so much for sending me a message of encouragement".
Controversial breastfeeding ads online, comparing breastfeeding women to cows?
An online breastfeeding company has launched an ad that likened breastfeeding women to milk.
Breastfeeding device manufacturer Elby has released a somewhat lavish music video ad that shows the freedom that new breastfeeding devices bring to breastfeeding women as they launch the world's first wearable silent breastfeeding device.
Four women who recently gave birth to babies danced at a grass-fed cow festival and the lyrics were, "Yes, I'm pregnant, but I can't see the tail", and "Can't you see the breasts?
The chorus continues, "Let's just keep on rubbing and sucking the baby, keep on rubbing, keep on rubbing the breast".
The ad was controversial online when it was posted on a Facebook page.
Over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions, with many saying it's a waste to the farming industry.
"It was a very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like humans, we have to milk the young, and we have to milk them, and the other thing is that we separate the young after a few days, and they're also commenting on the milk.
Elby suction machines can be directly attached to the inner linen without being marked.
Another commentary said: "It is a natural fact that this ad is traumatizing nursing mothers and babies.
But shouldn't we use milk to advertise a breastfeeding device for women who don't have to drop off babies?"
Another commentary reads, "No word for it!"
There are comments advocating for breastfeeding ads, and one woman admitted that the ad was "sweet".
"I think it's a natural invention.
If I'm still breastfeeding, I want to have it.
I felt like a whole cow every time I was breastfeeding.
I took it as a bit of a peculiarity, but it was a reflection of reality.
It's a product of genius".
Another commenter said, "I think this is a funny ad for a breastfeeding woman who thought of herself as a cow while she was nursing at work or in the bathroom".
It's not a commercial that praises or judges the agricultural industry".
The women on the back of the ad say they're wearing bra bra and dancing.
The ad was based on the fact that many women who breastfeed were considered cows at the time of breastfeeding.
The Elby breastfeeder has no sound, no electrical wiring or tubes, and can be attached without being marked in the breast bra, so it can move freely and carry the baby inside and also exits during breastfeeding.
Mother's partner and ECD, Anna Ballarin, commented, "Elbi vacuuming is a groundbreaking product that should be launched globally.
By showing both breastfeeding women and cows simultaneously, it illuminates the issues associated with breastfeeding and shows in an interesting way how much freedom new breeders guarantee.
This isn't the first time Elby's breastfeeding device has graced the headline.
During Lander Fashion Week, two nursing mothers dressed as designer Marta Yakuboski, with their breast implants attached, walked the walkway.
Hundreds of illegal immigrant children are quietly being held in shelters along the Texas border.
While the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border monthly has not changed significantly, the number of detained illegal immigrant children has skyrocketed, in part because the Trump administration has announced a ruthless crackdown that has made it harder to connect children with sponsors.
Generally, most sponsors are afraid to take action because they are more likely to be deported from the United States if they choose to take their children away because they are illegal immigrants.
In June, the U.S. government announced that all adults associated with potential sponsors must submit an index and share the index data with immigration officials, which increased the risk of deportation.
Last week, Matthew Alvens, the senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified in Congress that he had arrested dozens of applicants who had pledged to sponsor orphans.
Later, the executive office announced that 70% of the arrested applicants had no prior and record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the family members or relatives are illegally in the United States, and a significant number are foreign criminals.
So we're going to keep tracking these illegal criminals", Alvens added.
According to the Department of Defense, in order to handle children more quickly, the U.S. government introduced a new law that would take the children to court within a month of their stay, instead of waiting 60 days as usual.
In many cases, instead of going to court directly, they use the burmese currency to answer the immigration judge about their legal status.
If he is not considered a supporting subject, he is immediately forced to be deported.
According to the shelter staff and the system, as the time of detention increases, children become increasingly anxious and depressed, and suddenly start to act violently or attempt to escape.
Supporters said they were more concerned that large facilities like Tornillo were more likely to ignore the emotional symptoms that children of scale are experiencing.
When children are not mentally prepared or do not greet their friends properly and are suddenly placed in a residential care facility, children who are already struggling in many ways are more traumatized.
Syria, which has demanded the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey.
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Alem called on Syrian refugees to return to their homelands, even though the war has been going on for eight years.
Mu'alem, who is deputy prime minister, said foreign occupying forces were illegally staying in Syria under the pretext of a major terrorist attack and would deal with the situation.
"Foreign occupying forces must withdraw immediately without any conditions", the UN General Assembly expressed its intention.
Mu'alem claims that the "terrorist war is over" in Syria and says that since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have been displaced.
The Damascus government also added that "the holy battle will continue until all terrorist groups and all illegal foreign occupying forces are completely eradicated from all Syrian territory".
The United States has sent about 2,000 troops to Syria to train and advise Kurds and Syrian Arabs, who are mainly opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed 1,000 ground troops to war-torn Syria.
The situation with regard to the refugee issue has improved to the point of being returned, and he has accused "some Western countries" of creating irrational fears that refugees are not returning to their homelands.
"I have asked international social and human rights organizations to help refugees return to their homelands".
"We're politically raising questions about what part of it needs to be treated as a human rights issue", said Muallem.
The United States and the EU have warned that they will not support reconstruction until Assad and the opposition agree to a political end to the war.
According to the UN representative, Russia and Turkey have recently created an opportunity to promote political talks by agreeing to establish a replacement base in Idlib, the last rebel headquarters.
Thanks to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, the region of 3 million people was protected from Russian-backed Syrian attacks.
But Mu'alem stressed that the deal had a definite deadline and said he hoped that a military operation would wipe out the jihadist Nusra front linked to al-Qaeda.
UN Ambassador Stefan de Mistura expects the new government and the other side of the committee to draft a constitution and prepare for elections in Syria.
Mu'alem put conditions on the committee for the Syrian government's participation, warning that government representatives should be limited to reviewing the provisions of the current constitution and not interfere.
Why Trump is going to win re-election
With that logic, Trump will likely succeed in 2020 under the premise that he will not step down as a Democrat or a Democrat before the end of his term, as many progressives would like.
It will certainly be the most dramatic milestone in the presidency of the Republic.
I can't get a signal from the viewer's pyro at the moment.
Since 2014, CNN's golden hour ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average golden hour viewership of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's Channel 4 Media Show attracted 3.5 million viewers to major news broadcast times, achieving the number one viewing rate among cable channels.
Neil Baer, general manager of ABC drama The Living Dead, said: "This is like a fire that people are guiding because it's not understandable.
Comedy writer and author of the harsh truth-telling story of a love affair and the secret entry into the Hollywood boy's club, Nell Scoble, presents a different theory.
Scobel remembered a taxi he took in Boston just before the 2016 election.
The article told her that she was going to shoot Trump.
She asked me why?
Scobel told me that the reporter told me that Trump made me laugh, and he said, "Yes".
In chaos, there is a value of entertainment.
And, of course, unlike anything on television, the stories that are flowing from Washington can determine the future of Ro v. Wade, the possibility of reunification of immigrant families, and the state of the global economy.
Turning the channel is a trick only privileged viewers can enjoy.
Still, when you're watching the panel discuss Bob Woodward's use of a deep-rooted backdrop, a $15,000 tajo leather air jacket from Paul Manneport, which the Washington Post saw as a self-confident dress, and the suggestion by Stomi Daniel that Trump's, well, vicious portrayal of his body crossed the landscape of an obese citizen, it feels like you're going beyond the scope of the expert panel.
I'll never see Super Mario from the same perspective again.
Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the sitcom, Trump Show, said that Trump's actions toward the recurring antagonists (such as a fight in the American Football League or praising Kim Jong-un) look like reality shows because he feeds the audience every day.
You can't miss an episode because you're behind.
When I visited Mr. Plays this week, it was a glorious day at 80 degrees on the north shore of Kauai Island, but he was locked in his room watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was faced with the fact that Brett Cavernot was standing in the Senate bench and could not look away from the Supreme Court's fate on the day of judgment.
Mr. Plays remembers when we were doing a stupid show, people used to say, "The destruction of Western civilization has come".
I thought it was a joke, but I knew it was the right thing to say.

Foreign money, the highest barrier, flowed into the midterm elections.
It's no surprise that funds are flowing into Pennsylvania's 17th District, because the reorganization of the House of Representatives is about to force two sitting members to fight for a seat.
House Speaker Connor Ram, who won a special election in other districts last spring due to recent constituency reorganisation, was forced to step up.
Ram pits himself against former Pennsylvania Republican Representative Keith Rothfuss, who represents District 12.
The newly drawn map was constitutionally garrisoned to the Republican party's taste after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January.
The election campaign for the new 17th District sparked a financial dispute between the Democratic Party's Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Election Campaign Committee (NRCC), the main political party's financial backbone.
Ram became famous in March for winning the special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District by a margin of margin.
The seat has been held by the Republican Party for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the region by 20 points.
Political experts, the Democratic Party will be a little ahead.
The United States, China, and El Salvador are trying to block the move.
Diplomats witnessed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized China without American backlash.
Trump had a very friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Barrera of Panama in June 2017, and he stayed in Panama until his colleagues fired the Trump corporate management team.
State Department officials have called for the recall of the top U.S. diplomatic missions in the Dominican Republic, Panama, and El Salvador, which was due to a recent decision not to recognize Taiwan, as State Department spokesman Heather Nawart said earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only aimed at El Salvador, which received about $140 million in 2017 from the United States in the name of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed ban included the removal of financial support and visa restrictions, which would have been a painful experience for El Salvador, which has suffered high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings continue, officials in North and Central America have decided to postpone a high-level meeting focused on security and the economy similar to last year's meeting, which appeared to be a step forward in efforts to stem the trend of migrants heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear they wanted the conference to continue, effectively blocking the prospect of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence was recommended to speak at a meeting scheduled for mid-October, where diplomats said it would show the importance the government attaches to the meeting.
And three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned from Washington to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any cruel reminder or punitive item.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined a statement on the details of the discussion, which was explained by three U.S. ambassadors, two of whom agreed to discuss internal decisions under the assurance of anonymity.
External experts, who are closely connected to the administration and also agreed to remain anonymous, confirmed their explanation.
The history of research
Trump's legal obstacles, as suggested by special counsel Robert Mueller, may be inevitable.
According to reports, Muller has launched an investigation to find out if Russia was colluding with the Trump campaign when it interfered with our election.
If the owners of Congress change, Trump will be accused of being at the heart of the case just before he is re-elected to the ballot, and he may become a fellow judge.
It's a full-blown fantasy of if, and the fact that Trump's downfall is unconditional doesn't mean that the same rival in Europe will be unconditional.
Both sides of the Atlantic have a choice to decide the continuity of this situation.
In 1938, German officers prepared to launch a coup against Hitler, which would have been successful if the West had continued to resist Hitler and supported Czechoslovakia.
But we failed, and we blew off the opportunity to stop the massacre.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, where the progress of unbridled democracy is either accelerating or slowing.
The American people are at a turning point in history.
What if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who could have interfered with the Muller investigation?
Rosenstein was in trouble shortly after the newspaper reported that he had secretly recorded the president's speech and assumed he was not worthy of the president.
Rosenstein said the Times' explanation was inaccurate.
How would we react if the FBI's investigation into Cabernet Sauvignon was insufficient or unlawful, or if the Supreme Court ruled that he was innocent despite credible testimony and sexual assault allegations?
And most importantly, will we hold Trump accountable in the midterm elections for Congress?
If we fail to meet these challenges, democracy will fall into a cold winter.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lessons we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, where I once lived as an ambassador, and was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that occupied Czechoslovakia.
My mother survived, and 60 years later, she immigrated to the United States and sent me to light the Sabbath morning on a table with Nazi carvings.
How can I not be optimistic about the future with such a legacy?

The Rangers' Graham Dorrance, Rapid Bean, are optimistic about the upcoming game.
Rangers will face home team Rapid Bin on Thursday. Rangers know that following the surprising draw they had made earlier this month against Spain's Vial, if they win this match against Austria, they can lay a solid foundation for their entry into the Europa League G-League.
Midfielder Graham Dorrance did not appear until his first match against Biarreal in a 2-2 draw with a knee injury, but he believes the Rangers will be able to achieve greater results based on these results.
"We had a good scoring situation because the Cubs are a good team", said Durrance, 31.
We went into the stadium, we could score, we could do something.
I don't know if I could have scored more points in the end, but overall, the draw was a fair result.
I think that Vijayal was probably better in the first half, and I think we were better in the second half.
On Thursday, the big Europa League game is held again.
We hope to get three points, but I think it's going to be a tough game because Viaregal did well last time, but if we work with the fans on the pitch, we can build a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough because of personal injuries and changes in the club, but now the club is quite satisfied.
The team is in good shape, all the players are enjoying themselves, and the training is good.
I hope to move on and forget about this season and be successful.
Women, you can't sleep worrying about old age.
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of the care services they wanted, very few people shared a conversation with their families about it.
Half of the respondents in this nationwide survey said they talk to their spouses about long-term care services.
Only 10 percent said they had conversations with their children.
Holly Snyder, president of the National Life Insurance Company, said the Cheyenne people want their families to take care of themselves, but they don't try to talk.
This is how you start a conversation.
Tell your spouse and children: If you don't have enough time to say what you want, there's not enough time for your family to prepare for care.
Talk to counselors or family about where and how to get care, because these choices are important factors in determining the cost of care.
Bring financial torture: If you are tortured, it can help to cover the cost of care.
Funding for long-term care service choices can be provided through a long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value mixed life insurance policy, or, if the money is sufficient, a private equity fund.
You must resolve legal issues: Avoid legal disputes.
Have a health insurance agent to help you monitor your health care and let the professionals follow your lead when communication is not possible.
Also, consider borrowing the power of a lawyer for financial management.
Choose a trustworthy person to make financial decisions and avoid being pushed for a scholarship when normal life becomes impossible.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed by the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pallu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With the communications team in a state of distress, emergency services could not obtain any information about the eastern part of the Fallujah region, which is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
More than 16,000 people in Palu have fled the disaster.
Some important facts about the Fallu and East Gala regions of Sulawesi include:
Palau is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island. Palau's population as of 2017 is approximately 379,800.
Palu was hit by an earthquake and tsunami during the 40th anniversary celebration of the city.
East Gala is a regency extending for 300 km (180 mi) along the coast of the northwestern region of Sulawesi.
The region is one administrative step below the provincial level. East Gallaga's population as of 2017 was about 299,200.
Agriculture and fishing are the main industries in the Central Province of Sulawesi, especially East Ghala region.
Nickel mining is also of high importance within the province, but is concentrated in the Morowali on the other side of Sulawesi Island.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, the last 100 years have seen the tsunami hit Pallu and East Ghala.
The 1938 East Gala tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the western region of East Ghala and killed nine people.
Indonesia is geologically located in the Pacific volcanic zone and is often affected by earthquakes.
The major recent earthquakes and tsunamis were as follows:
2004: On December 26, a devastating earthquake on the western coast of the northern province of Aceh in Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A strong earthquake struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits the most populous island of Java in Indonesia, causing a tsunami on the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the western Sumatra province's capital, Padang.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hits one of the Mantawai Islands in Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hits the Pidi Jaya Regency in Aceh province, causing a riot among people who thought of the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami, but the collapsed building killed more than 100 people.
2018: A threatening earthquake hits the Indonesian tourist destination of Rombok Island, killing more than 500 people. Most of the damage occurred in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed by the earthquake and thousands of tourists were temporarily isolated.
The eldest son of Sera Failin, arrested for domestic violence.
Trace Peiline, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, was arrested for assault.
Track Failin, 29, who lives in the Wasilla area of Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence, and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska police.
According to police reports, a woman's acquaintance took her phone when she tried to report the charges to the police.
Paylin is currently being held in a Matanuska-Sustina pre-medical facility and is being held on a $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He also appeared in court on Saturday to protest the verdict and declared himself to be innocent.
Paylin could face up to three Class A misdemeanors, including up to one year in jail and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a one-day jail term and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Failin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Peylin.
My mother, Sera Failin, called the police and reported assault charges.
The case is being referred to the court, which is now a veteran.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated during domestic violence.
Failin's girlfriend claimed he had a face-off.
In 2016, Serra Paylin was accused by a group of veterans of her son's violent behavior as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his experience in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people killed
On Friday, an earthquake struck Sulawesi, Indonesia, killing at least 384 people.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and telecommunications systems are paralyzed and the death toll is expected to rise within days.
The quake struck the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos of the shock moments on social media.
When the tsunami landed on the beach, hundreds of people gathered in Palu to enjoy the beach festival.
Federal prosecutors, unusual attempted death sentence for a suspect in a New York City terror attack.
New York's federal prosecutor is seeking to impose the death penalty on Seppullos Cyclops, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people. This is a rare case in which federal crimes have not been committed since 1953.
According to the charges, the 30-year-old Cyclops allegedly used a home depot-hire truck to hit a pedestrian and a cyclist facing the road on the Lower Manhattan Westside Highway.
According to a plea filed by the prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, to justify the death sentence, the prosecutor must prove that Cyclops deliberately killed eight victims and deliberately injured them.
According to court documents, both charges are punishable by death.
A few weeks after the incident, the federal grand jury issued 22 indictment items to Cyclops, including eight counts of manslaughter by aggravated battery, violent overthrow, and car wreck charges, which federal prosecutors frequently file in planned criminal cases.
Prosecutors stated that the raid required a deliberate plan and a jury trial, describing Cyclops's criminal practices as brutal, brutal, and corrupt.
In the city of Honsay, Habibullevich Cyopov brought the wounds, injuries, and life-threatening effects to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Klebes, Anne-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erridge, Hernán Perouche, Hernán Diego Mendoza, and the family and friends of Damien Pegnuko, and Alejandro.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the Southern District Court of New York sentenced him to death.
Defendant Khalid Vance was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last federal case to carry out the death penalty in New York State was in 1953 with Julius and Essell Rosenberg, both of whom were married when they were convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saifov, who is from Uzbekistan, has not shown any regrets for a long time after the incident.
Police said Cyclops told the investigator that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the prosecution, Siphop said that he had given the authorities the idea of banning the crime by viewing ISIS videos on his phone.
According to police, Syphoph also asked for the ISIS flag to be flown to the hospital.
He denied all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Cyclops' lawyers, said the lawyers were obviously disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
He added that instead of accepting life sentences without the possibility of parole and making the accusations admitted, attempting to sentence the death penalty only makes the wounds of all those involved worse.
Saypov's defense team asked the former prosecutor not to commute the death sentence.
Conservative MP, you say that Nigel Parragh is in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Parraj vowed to activate the army of the Chadian people during the protest at the Conservative Party meeting place today.
Former British Independent Party leader Parragh said politicians should feel the heat of the opposition to the European Union, to the point that one member of Theresa May's cabinet said he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative Party councillor Peter Boone told the Birmingham protesters that if Parrazy had been the minister of Brexit, Britain would have left by force.
But Prime Minister May has revealed that the Conservative bloc's European Union rallies are taking part in anti-Brexit protests and are struggling to integrate a severely divided cabinet.
With pro-Brexit, opposition and the European Union's continued attacks, May is working hard to bring the deal with the European Union to a top-level orbit.
May's allies advised that despite opposition, she should continue to push out to negotiate with the EU headquarters in Brussels, and that Labour and the EU's opposition should choose between her negotiating proposal and the deal.
The MP said that withdrawing from the meeting in Solihull meant withdrawal and that he wanted to topple the agreement with the Pan-European Union.
He said he should take the parliament as a partner and give it authority to negotiate with the EU headquarters in Brussels.
If he had been the chief of staff, we would have already left.
Boone, a member of the Wollingburger parliament, also added: "I will fight for Brexit, but first I have to break the agreement with the European Union".
He also expressed opposition to the European Union and said that the Chinese did not fight a world war to subdue it.
I want to make our own laws in our country.
The sitting member denied the public's opinion that the opinion had changed since the 2016 vote.
Conservative European Union-led leftist Andrea Jenkins also took part in the protest and told reporters: "I will speak out loud.
The Prime Minister's deal has lost popularity among the general public, the opposition will not vote in favour, and the deal is unpopular within the Conservative Party and among activists who took to the streets to elect us in the first place.
Please dismantle the agreement and listen to the people.
In addition, through her remarks to the Prime Minister, she added that the law only allows the Prime Minister to keep his office when he keeps his promise.
At the rally, Parrazy said that if politicians betrayed the decision by the 2016 referendum, they would feel the heat.
He added that the issue of the shadow is with us, our people, and our political class.
The Chechens are trying to betray Brexit, and we've come together to tell the people that we can't just betray the people and run.
In his statement to his passionate supporters, he hopes that you will show a warm flavor to our political class, which is just before betraying Brexit.
We will unite the people's forces that have brought the victory of Brexit to this country and will never stop until it becomes an independent, autonomous and proud republic.
Meanwhile, the European Union's remnant marched in Birmingham city centre ahead of a two-hour rally.
After the rally began, some activists waved their arms at the Conservative Brexit tent.
Labour's top secretary, Adonis, held a rally to insult the Conservative Party, which was facing security issues with the party's app.
The people who said that the Canadians could have all the information technology systems and all the other technologies in Canada, and that it would be possible to have a free trade without a bargaining chip, Ireland and a free trade without borders, he said.
It's a nonsense.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit.
Warren, the campaign plan, the jury trial, the jury trial.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will consider running for reelection after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, shared his plans Saturday at a town council meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized President Trump, is running for re-election with Republican state representative Jeff Deal, who was co-chairman of the Trump campaign in 2016.
Warren is currently running for President Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday afternoon's event at Holyoke was Warren's 36th residents' meeting using the town council method applied since Trump's election.
One of the attendees asked her if she had any plans to run.
Warren said it was time for the lady to go to Washington and get to the top and fix the government.
The suspect in the shooting death of the Louisiana State University Simpson has been arrested.
Louisiana Baton Rouge police said Saturday they arrested a suspect in a Friday shooting that killed Wade Sims, a Louisiana State University basketball player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at ET News that 20-year-old Deaton Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m.
ET News released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead in the early morning hours of Friday in the Western campus.
Police Chief Murphy J. Paul said that Shweed Sims suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head and died as a result.
Wade tried to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was present at the scene during the interrogation, held a weapon and confessed to having shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge District Police Department.
Sims is a 6-foot-6-inch basketball player from Baton Rouge. He played 32 games that season, starting 10, and averaged 5.6 points, 2.9 rebounds and 17.4 minutes per game.
Louis Hamilton, team leader, and then Sebastian Pettell, who won the World Championship.
It was clear from the moment Valterie Bottas came in ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' Team Order would play an important role in the race.
From the starting line, Botas got off to a good start, keeping the lead for the first two laps, calling Petel to attack his teammate Hamilton and throwing him out.
Petel came to the stop first and let him continue running at the end of the pack, so he had to be more careful.
Hamilton entered the stop after one lap, but after a fierce confrontation between the two vehicles, the Ferrari driver was powerlessly put at risk of resistance after a double action at the third transformer, leaving the inside and he was able to push forward.
Max Perstafan started in the back row of the stadium on his 21st birthday and finished seventh on the first lap.
After the game, he continued to push the tires tightly and saw a quick finish line, while also repeating Kimi Raikkonen and finishing fourth.
He finally got to the stop on the 44th wheel, but he couldn't accelerate for the remaining eight laps, and Ray Cullen regained fourth place.
I was so impressed with the whole weekend at the Cumbalttery, and it was a very mythical day to let me go.
Our team finished first and second, and they did very well, " said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump publicly mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally last Saturday, claiming she did not leak a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing the Brett Kavanaugh nominee of sexual assault.
President Trump did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee at a meeting in West Virginia, accusing what is happening in the Senate of "showing a good showing of unfair, unflattering and untrue biases against people.
"What's been going on in the Senate over the last few days and the beautiful thing is that I've seen people angry, angry, disloyal, weak, and untrue", he said.
I saw the leaked content and I said, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't.
Do you remember?
Did you leak the information to the hon. member Diane Feinstein?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't get the fluid.
Well, wait a minute.
"We leaked... "No, we didn't", he added, imitating the senator.
The Feinstein MP received a letter detailing charges against the Caberno nominee filed by Ford last July, which was leaked in early September. However, the Feinstein MP denied that the letter had been leaked from his office.
The Hill newspaper reported that a member of the Painstaking Senate had "not hidden Dr. Ford's claims.
She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret as she asked.
But President Trump did not approve of Senator Feinstein's claim, which President Trump said at a meeting Saturday: "To put it bluntly, it was a really bad body language".
She might not have, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing his defense of the chief justice candidate accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president signaled that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
They're trying to regain power with whatever numbers they can use.
They'll see how discriminatory and unfortunate they are, and they don't care who they hurt and who they have to overthrow to take power", President Trump said, the media reported.
The Dundee Stars of the Elite League won 5-3 over the Belfast Giants.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a game against the Dundee Stars.
Dundee Stars won 5-3 in the second leg against the Belfast Giants on Saturday in Dundee and blamed the loss on Friday in the Elite League match against the Belfast Giants.
Giants led by two goals in the first half with a strike by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beaulieu.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Connie added goals for home team Dundee Stars before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead and made a partnership with the Giants.
Francois Boucher added a point before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals confirmed the win, which led Dundee to a tie with the Giants.
It was the third ever loss in the Elite League for Adam Kipf, who defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season for Dundee and the Giants, and the Giants won their last three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal with Kendall McFaul in the first half at 3:35 and four minutes later, Bobbilieri, assistant to David Rutherford, doubled the score.
Sullivan helped the home team take the lead at 13:10 early in the intense game, and at 15:16 with Matt Markett's help, Connie scored a touchdown.
Dwyer scored his second goal that night and the Giants held the lead until the first break.
The home team boosted the heat and Bushar scored a power play goal in 27:37 to make the home team a point once again.
Connie and Charles Coran helped the latter Nelson lead Dundee to the lead for the first time, and he led the team to victory in the middle of the season's playoff game.
Currently, four of the last five games are played by the Giants, who will play their next game on Friday at their home ground against Milton Keynes.
Hundreds of passengers were trying to help avoid the earthquake, and the air traffic controller died.
An Indonesian air traffic controller died trying to help a plane carrying hundreds of people land safely on the ground. He is being hailed as a hero.
On Friday, a massive earthquake and tsunami struck Sulawesi, killing more than 800 people and leaving many missing.
Strong violence continues to rise and damage the area and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues running for their lives, the 21-year-old Anton Gunawan Agung refused to leave the control tower at the heavily shaken Mutiara Sis al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He was still there to ensure the safe takeoff of the then-runway Battic Air 6321.
He jumped from the traffic control tower, thinking the traffic control tower was falling.
He later died in hospital.
Australian ABC broadcaster Johannes Syrait, spokesman for the Indonesian Airports Authority, reported that his decision would have saved hundreds of lives.
We recovered a helicopter from Kalimantan's Balipahan and took him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"I think the news of the storm is breaking my heart", he added.
Meanwhile, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, access to East Gala, Jaya, and Butung is limited. Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands.
A spokesman for the Disaster Relief Agency, Sutofo Furuo Nugroho, said: "The death toll appears to be still increasing, with many bodies still under the rubble and it is difficult to trace them".
The highest waves of 6m were topped with the ground of Pallu.
Military and commercial aircraft are importing supplies and supplies.
The mother of the child, Kusuma Lisa, 35, told Sky News in an interview: "An ambulance is bringing the body.
There is a lack of clean water.
Small tombs are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, the representative of the International Indonesian Cross (IRC), said in an interview with CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help survivors, but they don't know what they'll find there".
This is already tragic, but it could get much worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widdo arrived in Palu on 23 March and issued the following instructions to the military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the front".
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by the earthquake in Rombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
A man has been reported missing after a plane crashed in the flagship, according to Air New Guinea.
The airline said one person was missing after the plane crashed into the Pacific coat of arms of Micronesia and that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Newginie said in a Saturday afternoon press release that there was no male passenger currently available.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for details such as the passenger's name or nationality.
When the plane was flooded while attempting to land at the Irish airport, local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew.
Officials said seven passengers were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The exact cause of the crash, the exact sequence of events, is still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed on the coast without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
Bill Gaines, an American passenger, said the plane came in very low.
It was so glad that Mrs. Jaines said, "I'm sorry".
Ms. Jaines said she and others were able to walk to the emergency room of the sinking plane, over water that had boiled to their hips.
The crew were shouting in panic, and he said he had suffered a slight injury to the head.
The U.S. Navy said that before the plane sank in water about 30 meters (100 feet), sailors working on the anchor improvement were able to escort people to shore using a boatship to help with the rescue.
According to the Air Safety Network (ASN), 111 people have died in the past 20 years in crashes involving PNG-registered airlines, but there have been no accidents involving Air New Guinea.
The analyst described a time when a woman was shown alive being burned at the stake one night.
Prosecutors took a Saturday break from the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert in the field of information analysis at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours.
Roulette used her cell phone records to explain to the jury how she identified the identity of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, the night Jessica Chambers, 19, died.
According to reports by Clarion Leisure, Roulette received location information from several phones, and said that the fact that Telis was with Chambers at the evening on the day of the incident contradicted his previous claims.
And analyzing the cell phone data, while he was saying he was with his friend Michael Sanford, it turned out that he was actually with Chambers, and the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if he was telling the truth about what Telis said that night about being in a truck in Sanford, Sanford said, "My truck was in Nashville and he's lying".
Another contradiction is that Teles said she had known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of her death.
According to the phone records, they've only known each other for a week.
Roulette said that after Chambers died, Telis deleted Chambers' messages, phones, and contacts from his cell phone.
He told Hayle that the knight had erased her from his life.
The prosecution will begin its final hearing on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held later that day.
What is hip-hop with a high race consciousness?
Some hip-hop trio want to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based High Bride argues that hip hop has moved away from its initial introspection of political messages and social issues.
They want to get back to the roots of hip-hop and get conscious hip-hop back.
Artists like Fugue and Curman have recently been revived in Britain through artists like Akalena Rookie.
Another black man?
New York resident Bomo "complained a couple about being fired for racially discriminatory characters".
A New York nanny has been accused of racially dismissing the couple after receiving a misrepresented text from her mother complaining that she was "another black".
The couple described the lawsuit as "a scandal" because they were not racist.
Lindsay Plasco-Flacksman, the mother of two, expressed embarrassment when she learned that Mr. Bomo Giselle Morris, who first went to work in 2016, was black.
Mrs. Flasco-Flaxman sent a letter to her husband saying, "No more black people".
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mr. Morris twice.
The New York Post reported that after "uncomfortable" Flasco-Placksman realized his mistake, an active black midwife said she was not doing her midwifery properly and was expecting a Filipino, she fired Mr. Morris.
Ms. Morris was paid a day's wages and sent home on Uber.
Mr. Morris is seeking damages from the couple in connection with the dismissal. He has no formal contract, but as the original employer, he is claiming compensation for having worked as a nanny for six months, paying $350 a day for the purpose he was hired for.
She added in an interview with the Post on Friday, "I want to show them that they shouldn't do this and I know that being gay is discriminatory".
The couple rejected the claim that they were racist, saying it was reasonable to fire Mr. Morris because they feared that he would be untrustworthy after displeasing her.
"I sent you a letter that I didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist, my husband, Joel Placo, said in an interview with the Post.
"But would you, by mistake, leave your children in the hands of someone you've been disrespectful to?
What about the newborn?
Please.
Placo compared the case to a case of a miscarriage of justice, saying that she was only two months pregnant and was in a very difficult situation".
"Would you hire someone like that?
It's not that good", Plasco, an investment banker, added.
While the case was still ongoing, the public prosecutor's office quickly denounced the couple through SNS and rebuked their behavior and logic.
The new letter revealed that publishers in Paddington were concerned that readers would not be able to empathize with the bear they were talking about.
Bondage's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: "It is difficult to understand the position of the first person who reads it before the book is published.
It's very interesting for those of us who know about Paddington's enormous success.
Her father, who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman, was inspired by a small toy bear and decided to write a children's book. She said she would not have predicted that her father would be optimistic about his work and that he would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, which coincided with her father's death last year, was "sad but sweet".
She described Paddington as "a very important member of our family", saying her father was proud of the success of the final piece, but he didn't get a big swing.
She said that he was a rather quiet man, and he was not a man who liked to chat.
"But it felt so real to him that it was like having a child who accomplished something that you didn't really do, but you were proud of them.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always turned the ball over to Paddington".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
As soon as she landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur II hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life but failed.
"Nad called me regularly and said things were really bad, that she would be hard to live", said Mrs. Ednan Raphaelhouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad and Nad said she was going to die in two minutes.
And I said this.
"I love you very much, Shintashi".
I'll be right with you.
I'll do it with you.
The drugs doctors injected into her to keep her heart beating were slowly dying out and leaving her system.
She died a while ago, and it was all over.
I knew this was happening, so I had to sit and wait.
They could not cry or scream or cry, surrounded by their families and people.
I had to really put up with myself to cool myself".
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan Raphaelhouse, grieving the loss of her daughter, was unconscious of the ordeal she was going through and boarded the plane alongside the other passengers.
No one knew, she said.
"I was bowing my head, and the whole time I was tears.
It's hard to explain, but I was in the air and I felt a lot of compassion for Nad that I couldn't resist.
I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Put a card on the bridge to stop women who are addicted to vitamin D from committing suicide.
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries have been placed on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and a phone number card that people can ask for support.
Davis' son Tyler began suffering from depression at age 13 and committed suicide at age 18.
I hope no parent feels the feelings I feel every day", she said.
Davis, 45, of Ridney, said her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew his son's smile.
They said his smile had made a room fantastic".
But he gave up his job before he died because he was in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother first discovered his brother who had committed suicide.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm worried about the domino effect continuing to occur".
Mr. Davis created a card, and he said, "It's to let people know that you have people you can go and meet and talk to, even friends.
Don't be quiet and sleepy. You need a conversation".
Mr. Humphries, who was friends with Mr. Davis for several years, lost his 15-year-old partner, Mr. Mark, shortly after his mother died.
She said she hadn't told him she was feeling bad or depressed.
"Two days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was in a state of extreme depression. He did not face the children when the children opened their presents on Christmas Day.
She said his death was a great emotional shock to them, but they had to overcome it, because it would punch a hole in their family's heart.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to keep moving forward and fight".

As the FBI begins its investigation, the future of Brett Caverno is unclear.
Plack said on Saturday that if what he had asked for, such as time-limited, scope-limited investigations, were actually done, it would bring some unity, and he feared the commission would "fall apart" as it fell into a state of party stalemate.
Why didn't Mr. Cabrano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They're all off because of timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away on November 6. If the Republicans fail to campaign as expected, their attempt to elect him as a Supreme Court justice will suffer a serious blow.
George W. Bush has called on senators to support Kaverner. Kaverner worked for President Bush in the White House, and through President Bush met his wife, Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI writes the report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not clear if Cabrano will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, but if he does, Vice President Mike Pence will cast a ballot to confirm his appointment as a Supreme Court justice.
Kim Jong-un's number of rebels is down.
A South Korean parliamentarian said that the number of defectors entering South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
The MP said last year, with 2,706 people, there were 1,127 defectors, citing data from the South Korean Unified Services.
MP Park said the main factor was the impact of the amount demanded by the workers to strengthen border controls between North Korea and China and help with the evacuation.
North Korea has not made any public comment on the matter.
Most of the Taliban who came from North Korea eventually gained Korean citizenship.
The Korean government says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them leave via China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded DMZ between North and South Korea.
China often considers the defectors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees.
Strictly speaking, relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for a meeting focused on denuclearization negotiations, which have fallen into a state of stagnation.
This comes after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore last June.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Li Yong-ho, condemned the US sanctions as having not made progress since.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Ueno said that if we don't have confidence in the United States, we won't have confidence in our national security and that in such a situation, there is no way we can unilaterally disarm first.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Caverno "neuroscientist" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the interior minister in the House of Representatives, called Brett Caverno's chief justice candidate "neuroscientist", saying he was "culturally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court".
Fellows said this in an interview with the Texas Tribeca Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
Fellowship appeared in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, saying of Cabrano's testimony, "I couldn't have imagined that if she had acted in this way, they would have said 'neuroscientist'.
Caverno emotionally denied the allegations that she sexually assaulted a doctor, both teenagers and Christine Blaise Ford.
At the opening, Caberno was very emotional about his family and his high school days, sometimes almost screaming and even coughing.
He also blasted the Democratic members of the committee that surrounded him, calling their claims "a senseless and organized assassination of the liberal" angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 election defeat.
Pelosi said that he believed Caverno's testimony proved that he could not work for the Supreme Court because it showed that he had prejudices against Democrats.
She said she believes he fired himself by making such statements and by blaming Clinton and the Democrats.
Fellowship raised the question of whether he would try to impeach Cabrano if he was confirmed, if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only not eligible to serve on the Supreme Court, but he's not eligible to serve on the courts he's currently serving", Fellowship said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in Washington, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Democrat Felony added that he was concerned that Caberno would make a hostile ruling on the former president's affordable health care bill or the Ro-V-Wed decision.
Cabrano avoided a question from the Appeals Board about whether to reverse the Supreme Court's ruling.
Now is not the time to expect a nervous, biased person to go to court and say, "That's not cool", Pelosi said.
And women have to overcome it.
It's a fair criticism of her continued anger, which she can't say without crying.
We were angry and we were angry and after 45 years Mr. Starkin told me.
I guess this isn't uncommon, is it?
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a lieutenant somewhere, and she said she cried when she got angry, too, but she developed this technique: When she started crying and getting angry, she might think to someone she was talking to that she was sad because she was crying".
I'm going to be a little crazy.
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great".
Because tears are fundamentally misunderstood, tears are allowed to be partly the emitted source of anger.
One of my most vivid memories of my early career was in a male-centric office, when an elderly woman grabbed my scarf and took me upstairs, tearing me with inexpressible anger.
She told me that she would never let anyone else see you cry.
"They don't know you're angry.
They're going to sue you because they think you're sad and they think they're harassing you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Colorado Democratic Party's House of Representatives, worked with Gary Hart to run for president.
In 1987, Mr. Hart abandoned the race after being involved in an affair on a boat called Monkey Business. At that time, the member of Parliament, Schroeder, was deeply frustrated. She felt that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president herself.
She said with a smile after 30 years, "It was not a decision made after careful thought".
"There were seven more candidates in the race, and what they didn't need most was another candidate.
Someone called it the Princess of the Seven Dwarfs".
She was pushed out of the campaign because she started the campaign late, so she vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a fight.
She realized that some of her supporters who give 1,000 dollars to male runners would only give her $250.
Shall they think I can get a small sum? Shall she wonder.
When she announced that she would not run for office, she was overwhelmed with feelings of gratitude to those who supported her, institutions that made it too difficult to raise funds, frustration with the system that was difficult to target voters rather than deputies, and anger at sexism.
She said she would have thought I was in a coma and that Schroeder's former MP recalled how the media reacted to her behavior.
"I would have thought that Clinics was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my grave.
She cried.
What good will the trade war do to Beijing?
The beginning of the trade war between the United States and China seemed to be a hearsay one, and the battle was still far from over, but experts say the rift between the two countries could be a long-term blow to China.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year about tariffs on major Chinese exports of solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most important quarterly this week was the new tariffs on items worth $200 billion, which would tax half of all goods entering the United States from China.
China has repeatedly retaliated in the same way, most recently imposing tariffs of 5% to 10% on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to retaliate against the United States, and the world's second-largest economy is not likely to be a surprise anytime soon.
To degrade Washington means to accept the demands of the United States, but to openly turn to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
But experts say that if China can properly use the options it has, the pressure of the US trade war could reduce the interdependence of the two economies and serve China in the long run.
The fact that quick political decisions in Washington or Beijing can trigger economic crises in any country is actually far more dangerous than observers previously believed, said Abigail Grace, Asia researcher at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
The Secretary of State says that the Syrian refugee return is ready.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alem told the UN General Assembly that the situation in Syria was improving.
"Today, with the progress in the war on terror, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure", he said.
The government is continuing to relocate residents to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees are now in place, and they have been forced to leave Syria because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that threaten their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled abroad since the war began in 2011.
There are six million other people still living in Syria who need humanitarian assistance.
Minister Al-Mu'alem said he would welcome the Syrian government's help in rebuilding this devastated country.
However, he stressed that the countries that supported the insurgency would not receive conditional support or assistance.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team beat the United States by 16.5 to 10.5 in the 2018 Ryder Cup final at the Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight Ryder Cups in Europe and has not won a European title since 1993.
With the team of Danish captain Thomas Beecham taking the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States, Europe regained the crown.
During most of the tournament, the American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled hard, threw a tee shot into the water at 16th hole F3, giving Francisco Molinari a victory.
Italian golfer Mollinari is one of four players to win 5-0-0 since the 1979 tournament, when the current tournament rules were applied, and has shone through every round.
Jordan Spice of the United States defeated European team's top seed, Denmark's Tobias Olsen, 5 and 4.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost the match, 2-1, to England's Ian Polter, who may have been his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of Spain who has competed in eight Ryder Cups, scored 25.5 career points and became the all-time winner as a European athlete.
"I'm not crying, but I can't do anything today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and trusted me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy to have my trophy back.
"It's for the team, and I'm happy to be able to help", said Garcia, who was moved by the European title.
He gives a sex tape to the Spanish golfer John Ram, who defeated the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a Sunday fast.
I'm so proud to have played Tiger Woods. I grew up watching Woods play, said Ram, 23.
Woods has won four Ryder Cup matches in France and currently holds a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
He holds the second most major titles with the exception of Jack Nicklaus, but it's a strange statistic written by one of the greatest players of all time.
The U.S. team worked hard to send the ball to Fairway all weekend except for Patrick Leed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who had high capacity golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these players, they fought.
This morning we had a little pressure on Europe.
We were defeated.
I'm paying homage to Thomas.
He's a great team leader.
All 12 of his players were very good.
We're going to reorganize the team and work with the PGA and the Ryder Cup committee to move forward.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be a leader.
You must show respect.
The opposing team did better play".
Reduced concentrations in Pineapple, Manate, and Sarasota.
A recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that the deficit concentrations in some parts of Tampa Bay are generally declining.
According to the commission, a deficit is observed in the cluster of areas in Pineal, Manate, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier counties, meaning that the concentration is decreasing.
The equator stretches from the northern Pineapple to southern Lee County along about 130 miles of coastline.
The fossil remains were found about 10 miles from Hillsborough County, but in a smaller area than last week.
A decline was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, moderate or high concentrations were reported in Pinellas County, low or high concentrations in Hillsborough County, near or high concentrations in Manate County, near or high concentrations in Sarasota County and the coast, near or high concentrations in Charlotte County, near or medium concentrations, etc. Near or high concentrations in Lee County and the coast, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory diseases continue to be reported in Pineapple, Manate, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
No respiratory illness was reported in northwest Florida last week.
