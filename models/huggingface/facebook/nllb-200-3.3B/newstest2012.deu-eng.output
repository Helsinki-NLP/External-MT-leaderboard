No release amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected a request to abolish the articles on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was convicted as part of an amendment to the criminal code.
The Commission is proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the term 'contract' in the context of the directive.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly entering into a disadvantageous contract with Russia to purchase natural gas.
The judgment is not yet final, and the appeal of the convicted is due to be heard in court in December.
Timoshenko himself described the verdict as a political revenge of the regime and the trial also raised suspicions in the West that the court was biased.
The motion to remove from the penal code Article 365, which convicted the former Prime Minister, was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or the Libyan rebellion has its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him, the war is over.
Now we just have to decide the winners.
As is common in this region, Islamists win the elections, the only question is which - the moderates or the radicals.
The National Transitional Council embraced the customary law of Shari'a, of which there is now a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft, one simply cuts off the hand.
Women too should forget all thoughts of emancipation, and should execute any apostates, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the Qur'an will unite a society of rival tribes.
In short, Libya will have an order that is hardly imaginable and, above all, hardly desirable in this country.
- Our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively speaking it is not the best and it would not be suitable for the Libyans mentioned.
It is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were helped by the infidel dogs.
The only excuse they have is that the NATO air strikes were not directed by some American general, but by Allah Himself, whose omnipotence was praised after each successful hit.
The winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We have only participated in a shooting match, served the interests of Islam and our politicians have disposed of themselves in the person of a dictator, a political ally, without any benefit.
The European Union has a duty to help the countries of the region to develop their economic and social development.
This relieved the Hiesigen of one of their concerns - the expulsion of the Crusaders.
But can the oil companies get the black gold at a ridiculous price even without occupation?
The West can hardly and rightly boast of its selflessness in protecting human rights.
If the representatives of the Shari'a do not corrupt them.
The beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the spotlight of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm blew through Europe.
The countries published their GDP figures for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared with the previous quarter, while Germany and France increased.
But the bond market is now breaking all records.
Investors are not only looking at Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and a number of other European countries published their preliminary forecasts for economic developments in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5% as expected, France's by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted their data for the second quarter, with Germany showing higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the forecast 0.1%), while France showed a slight decline of 0.1% (initial data showed only stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared with the previous year.
However, compared with the previous quarter, GDP stagnated, confirming the trend of slower growth in economic output, according to the Czech Statistical Office.
So the results are worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared with the previous year, but stagnated compared with the previous quarter.
Preliminary and seasonally adjusted data show that the German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
In the eurozone as a whole and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2% between July and September, in line with analysts' expectations, compared to the previous quarter.
The Greek economy contracted by 5.2 percent compared with the previous year.
The yield on their 10-year government bonds rose to 28.45%.
The yields on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel the effects of the crisis...
The yield on Czech government bonds remains below 4%, even as the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, there are voices calling for the ECB to become the lender of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and now they celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football team has just completed the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent goal by Petr Jiráček, they won 1-0 in Montenegro.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will not be missing from the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz followed the rise in a detailed report.
A little excitement in the first half and a big fat lot of luck in the second.
The Czech team won the final 1-0 in Montenegro, thanks to the weakness of the home team, a brilliant Czech and the hero of the day Jiráček, and thus redeemed their ticket for the European Championship.
The Czech team's precise defensive play also meant that they were able to put the Montenegrins under more pressure only in the second half.
The unlucky ones in the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who missed two huge chances.
The Czech team will therefore be taking part in the European Championships next year, thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, and it is also gratifying that a bonus of about 200 million is being paid to domestic football.
From the first minutes, there was a very aggressive football.
Both teams combined long and so was played mainly around the center line.
In the second half, the pressure of the home team was also avoided and the Czech defense successfully defended the long shots before the penalty area.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living shield.
Several hundred university students formed a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
The European Union has a duty to ensure that the nuclear safety of its citizens is not compromised.
The students had prayed in front of the object at noon on Tuesday and then announced the death of the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Isfahan in Iran formed a living shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, where uranium is processed, on Tuesday.
They were doing so to show that they were prepared to protect their country's nuclear programme, even with their own lives if necessary.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has apparently not given up its efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon.
Israel is also talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed in front of the entrance to the compound at noon and then announced the death of the United States and Israel.
The Israeli press has reported that in the event of an attack aimed at crippling Iran's nuclear programme, the nuclear enrichment plant at the centre in Isfahan would also be the target of the attack by the Na­tan regime.
The menu of a child with a fatty habit: skipping breakfast and eating sausage for dinner
More than one third of children aged 9 to 13 are overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that children who are obese are more likely to come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
Once again, the environment in which a person grows up and the examples around him are vital to his healthy development.
On the tables of obese children, sausage is up to half as common as in families with normal-weight children.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had fries for dinner the day before the "Obesity is Not an Accident" campaign.
In families with fat children, exercise is not a favorite activity, but it is also the case for the majority of today's students - only 15 percent said that their parents take time to exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out towards the end of the school year last year and involved nearly 900 children from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the campaign "Obesity is no accident", which is supported by the General Health Insurance Fund and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12 000 pupils from fourth to eighth grades have taken part in the project.
Poor diet and lack of exercise in the family are key factors responsible for the alarming increase in the number of children who are overweight or even obese.
"Only half of the children surveyed said they ate breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dinner five times a day - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet", says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relatively small things, such as a regular family breakfast, are important for a child's healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of school families eat breakfast.
And in most families, everyone eats breakfast for themselves.
Worst of all, one in 10 families don't eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey also revealed that families with overweight children are much more likely to consume unhealthy potatoes.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sugary sodas every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed exercise, less than half of their parents do - 15 percent.
Make your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own diet plan from the options offered, according to their appetite and opinion.
"The preference of Czech children between 12 and 15 years old for nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite foods were many flour dishes, meat dishes, and, of course, desserts.
"The high popularity of sweet lemonade is particularly alarming", says the final report on the survey.
For lunch, the main course, the dough barely beat the chicken.
Legumes were almost unpopular among the children, and fish and vegetable dishes were very unpopular at lunch.
A Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits if given the right information.
"In the control group of respondents who completed the questionnaire after the instructional lecture 'Obesity is not a coincidence', there was in many cases a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy eating", the project results state.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to prefer ordinary water.
The children also reported much more frequent choices of chicken or fish as the main course of the day and were willing to eat less dumplings or sweet foods.
Professionals say - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I was a bit grumpy that this was a bit too much material to start with.
I had no idea what was coming.
Lectures by three industry professionals, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how to do it "on the square".
I'm afraid it's going to get worse.
The closer we get to the exam, the more information and practical tasks we have to face.
But even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it is still full.
This time we debated with the director, Alena (not a single man participates in the course), how to dress a woman who does not have an ideal proportioned figure.
And that's what most of us are.
Some have a neck too short, others a figure too youthful without proper curves, and still others are plump.
It is up to the stylist to visually conceal the broad shoulders, lengthen the neck, or create the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a woman like Jennifer Lopez -- so with big breasts, wide hips and a narrow waist -- in a nice, well-fitting way without being too provocative.
For example, if the waist-hip gap is so large that the skirt or trousers really do not fit, at least one piece should be tailored to your size.
You will not regret it, for good-fitting clothing is priceless.
A custom-made skirt like this is much better than one that's too high and too slippery, too waist-high, and so on.
Younger characters may, in turn, wear clothing with creases, braids, appliqués, embroidery, or racking.
With all this information and character types, I'm glad I have a whole week to think it over.
And yet I'm afraid that it's almost impossible to do, given the homework.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity to design outfits for - day dress and evening dress.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the respective star and the type of figure.
I'm supposed to "dress up" Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I am happy inside, because this is much better for me personally than, for example, to wear Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained probably a hundred kilos (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We are told to cut out garments from magazines or search the Internet, print them out, and then graphically edit them.
The resulting "Moodboard", as the whole thing is called, is intended to express our very personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It's very important to think about the graphic side of styling as well.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the magazines (according to specific requirements, for example, trend handbags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us.
But that's not until Sunday.
That means a stylist has to have a good overview.
The Saturday lecture, which was filled with information on the types of figures, was immediately spiced up by three visitors from the industry:
The project is led by the designer Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit it.
And a skilled stylist can work in a variety of ways with a single garment.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as a regular over your jeans, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on your naked body, put on heels, and wear it as a dress.
You just have to roll up your sleeves or your collar and the whole look is different.
"Play with it", he insisted.
But the advice that stood out to me was this: "You must first know the rules perfectly".
"Then you may hurt her", said Jacob.
I finally understand why we have to put all these doctrines together, what you can combine with what, and why, even if in fashion magazines you often see something completely different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist has to prepare many more outfits before he's going to take a photo.
So for a fashion story with ten pages (say ten outfits) you have to be prepared to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothes in the photo, when combined with other accessories, sometimes look very different than in reality.
So, all of this has to be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Jan Pokorný also confirmed that image and style are sometimes half of success.
You just have to look at Madonna, a not-so-brilliant singer, who's image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are viewed with a certain amount of reservation.
Even celebrities often consider this to be money thrown away (the main thing is that I bring something, how I look is secondary).
And if any of us do get dressed, we should expect that he or she will likely force us to be a size smaller than he or she really needs.
And then you just have to Google it to be sure that the tabloids are saying that the celebrity has lost weight or gained weight again, and so on.
Jan and Mario urged us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist should focus on fashion and then "build" the outfit.
In his work, he must first communicate with the people he is styling and he must be a skilled psychologist.
Judging people without offering to be judged and having his own opinion.
"When some manager asks us to go through her closet and pick out some nice items, we can't just go through the whole closet and say, 'Oh, my God, that's terrible.'"
"You have to find at least a few commendable things to recommend what to wear", says Mario.
He also showed us in real terms what a so-called "plate bag" must contain.
A bag that you can put on your waist and carry all the necessary belongings.
In addition to such clear items as scissors, hair removal rollers, and safety pins, it includes such utensils as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist to photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips to tighten the back of the garment if it is too large (needles or other clips are prohibited to prevent the fabric from breaking) and, of course, sewing.
So that we could not only listen but also try something practical, we learned how to properly tape shoes.
Even when you're shooting in a studio with a flat floor, you can damage the soles of your shoes, let alone the ones outside.
We were glued together and glued together...
The scissors must not be touched, lest they be damaged.
So you really have to be smart.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without limitation.
The skill I mentioned is not exactly my strong suit.
All of this was only a fraction of what we heard in the second weekend resumption class.
One thing I've learned is that professional styling is not a cakewalk.
V for Speed: The Run - the illegal race across America
The
The originally carefree ride is transformed by a series of completely avoidable, amateurish mistakes into a routine drive to the morning shift.
The ambitions were largely achieved, but what good was it if no one was willing to do a little more?
Even before it hit the shelves, the new installment, subtitled "The Run", was raising expectations.
He did promise to take the long-running Need for Speed series to a new level, and in the playable demo examples, he didn't seem to be just another one of many action racing games.
We were also curious to see what the most appropriate passages are missing, where the main character gets out of the car and walks on.
But as you're used to with NFS, the end result is a lot different than you'd expect.
Sure - they're potentially quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is marred by some superfluous bugs that have been present in this series for a few years now, more or less.
So they're not really mistakes anymore, but rather signs of a laziness that is basically incomprehensible to game developers.
The adventure is starting very well.
First introduced to the story, the main character Jack has some personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the West Coast, you get behind the wheel and the task is to be the first to New York.
The basic idea has a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You never get the feeling that this game is offering the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still very pretty, although the technical level of the graphics does not exceed that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing that's going to make a world of difference.
But the drive through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape seems visually very pleasant.
From time to time, unusual elements bring a little variety to each race.
In the desert, for example, you're surprised by a desert storm that severely limits your view.
In the mountains, you have to be very careful not to get hit by an avalanche.
Besides, the races are all pretty well integrated.
A few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the clock), then a personal duel with a single opponent awaits you.
And then the police get involved, and they want to screw you over.
A novelty is the scene where Jack leaves the car.
It's more like some kind of interactive animation where Jack is running away from someone and the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, there are far fewer such passages in the play than you'd expect (specifically, probably only three).
In the end, this is more to the advantage of the thing, because this element at least has no chance of becoming boring - it is in the context of the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the preceding parts.
That is to say, from today's point of view, while it does not uproot trees, on the other hand, it could not be said to be bad.
If you're looking for realistic simulations, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But for an action-packed racing car, the local model will still do quite well, although better could be found in the competition.
Until then, everything is in order.
Real problems only appear after a certain time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not quite OK.
You wouldn't expect a game like this to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have no idea how the car is going to behave before it hits anything, then obviously it's not all right.
A typical example is when you are overtaking or passing oncoming cars, where you can only "hit" the other car in some places, but in other, almost identical situations, you can get into a fight and do wildly crazy things.
Or the car will be scrapped.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter, but it's annoying.
The restarts are solved this way: if you have total damage or land far off the track, then you throw the game back to the last clue point of the track.
- Only in each race you only have five restarts.
Once you've exhausted them, everything starts again.
So the restarts are more like a tool in case something doesn't work out, but you shouldn't rely on it.
But sometimes even the reboot doesn't help, because there's nothing else that helps but memorizing the critical section.
What's really unpleasant is that the same things happen in the same places all the time.
For example, some curves require you to pass in a very specific way, otherwise you simply will not pass.
Otherwise, you will always encounter "civilian" cars in the same configuration at the appropriate place, whether you arrive first or fifth, five seconds earlier or one minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see the other car passing in front of you, playing with two cars, but by the time you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or brake.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed to make this situation happen right in front of you.
The counterparts have other advantages.
There are a few times throughout the game where you're always overtaken by the same opponent in the same spot, and again, regardless of the time.
The craziest thing is that this is the end of the game on the long bridge, which you cross in the opposite direction.
The opponent must obviously overtake one of us here.
And then when it's in front of you, it takes your view, so you start driving your car around a few times.
- Of course you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so obvious that it quickly takes away the joy of the game.
And that's a shame, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and sometimes so action-packed that you almost don't know where your head is.
And it doesn't matter what the "fault" is - the concept of fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in such a way that no boredom can arise, or something else entirely...
Another unusual idea is the change of car during the race.
Do not overlook the gas stations along the route, where you can change cars, although in most cases the car you have now will suffice.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limos for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical trips, for example on the mountain serpentines.
Hand in hand with the story mode is the task mode (challenges) - that is, the races in the individual localities that you know from the story.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points to be gained for one's own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and the story.
To get to the higher driver level, various objects must be opened: starting from the car, to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is also linked to the online function Autolog, which compares the own results with those of other players and also provides other collective functions.
One of the more incomprehensible carving is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you can drive to a subway tunnel (meinetwegen), where you can ride along the tracks in the dark (meinetwegen).
The speed gauge is between 100 and 200 km/h (for me), but then suddenly a subway comes from behind and drives you uncompromisingly to the scrap.
I think we're gonna have a long debate in our editorial office about whether this was a blackout by the game developers or whether the authors think we're that stupid.
The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
What's more annoying is that at some moments of excitement, the refresh rate slows down, sometimes quite dramatically.
This is particularly the case in accidents involving a large number of persons, where continuous FPS is of no use.
The soundtrack is fine, and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to a younger audience, a soundtrack was created "with something for everyone" - but who buys such a game just for the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run?
If the game weren't diminished by the totally unnecessary errors I mentioned, we could have claimed with the breast of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But it kind of makes the game seem unfinished.
A great pleasure in itself, but you should be prepared to be blindfolded by the power of airport traffic lights.
Concert by the Students of the Velvet Revolution with the Charles University Choir
The Festa Academica Festival is now for the third time offering a musical experience that links World Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution.
During the festival, the twenty specialist and university choirs will introduce themselves.
The festival will focus on the two concerts on November 17.
Charles University has a big stake in the festival.
"The participants include the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanities, and the festival committee includes the rector, Václav Hampl", said the head of the organising team, Jakub Čaloun.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of vocational schools choirs, which will take place on November 17 from 2 pm on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program includes the composition of the important Czech jazz musician Karel Růžička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evening, the concert "Students of the Velvet Revolution" (Studenty sametu) takes place in the halls of the People's House in Vinohrady, with the participation of university choirs, including choirs from Charles University.
Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate World Student Day and commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present choral music at the highest level to the public and to promote creative cooperation between young people.
The main organiser is the Association of Czech Choirs in cooperation with the Johannes Kepler Gymnasium.
The event was sponsored by Bohuslav Svoboda, the Lord Mayor of the capital city of Prague, and Václav Hampl, the rector of Charles University.
The festival will take place in Prague and Pardubice from 16 to 20 November.
The schedule includes not only festival concerts but also numerous music meetings, student happanings, matinees and other events.
The festival is organised by the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Culture.
The EU's ambassador to the EU, Ms Vicenová, said:
The Czech Republic has a reputation for being a negative and Eurosceptic country
"The Treaty of Lisbon has seriously upset the balance between the various institutions".
I didn't expect such a hard war to break out".
"It will take five or six years for the tide to turn and for everyone to get used to their new role", began Milena Vicenová, the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply in her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
The seriousness of her approach to the motto 'Europe in a clear and open way' was already shown in the first part of her lecture, in which she succeeded in describing the various EU institutions and their interrelationships in such a clear and understandable way that she could have been the envy of many lecturers at the Faculty of Law at Charles University.
The Commissioner also welcomed the new permanent President of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, he was criticized for being too inconspicuous - a gray-haired official who was not fit for such a role, but I must say that everyone was amazed at how well he handled the matter.
"He is a man who is able to listen patiently to the 27 Member States, to communicate with them and, above all, to have clear ideas about how the EU should be run.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was then explained by her as an answer to the question: "Who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?", as an important step towards unification and better readability of EU policy towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our oil-rich Quargel
Mrs Vicenová also spoke about the agenda on which the European Union has lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success, she said.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial and gas crises and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The fall of the government during the presidency was a major negative, which had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech delegation to the EU is currently very busy.
The Commission's proposals are not to be taken lightly, but to be implemented in a way that is acceptable to the citizens of Europe.
And then there is the seven-year EU budget, which is much more complicated because of the current economic situation.
The Commission has already taken the necessary steps to ensure that the budget is not used in a way that would be contrary to the interests of the Community.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans when she came to Brussels: 'Europe understandable'.
"If I don't like something, it's the creepy slang, the foreign words, the jargon that no one understands.
How can I as a citizen know whether Brussels is really making up curls or round cucumbers and different sized bananas or whether someone is really trying to ban the quargels?
She would also have liked to use the EU's ground to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
The EU ambassador said the Czechs were known to be Eurosceptics, who saw the negative rather than the positive sides of the issue.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more disturbing.
The Commission has already made a number of recommendations to the Council, and I would like to ask you to take this opportunity to inform the Council of the fact that the Council has decided to make a number of recommendations to the Commission.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or a Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you doing sticking your heads together - is that your V4 again?" and makes a rather sour face.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the word 'commercial' in the wording of the directive.
It is much more realistic than a 'European federation' to see the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the eurozone countries and the non-eurozone countries.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute for enhanced cooperation".
"It was first said that only those countries should cooperate who want to and those who do not want to should be left alone".
"There will be more and more of these institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong 'Europe of different speeds'", expects Ms Vicenová.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament and the Council should be given the opportunity to discuss the matter with the Council of Ministers.

The innovator IBM enters its second century of existence
If you were to look for a word that best describes IBM's strategy, it would be "longitudinalism".
To the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, and is known as a modern company, even though it was founded a century ago.
The foundation for this longevity was laid by its first chief - the visionary Thomas J. Watson, Sr.
He was the man who said that countless problems in the world could be solved if people would just think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became the trademark around which the future giant's life was to be played (and at the same time the title of the internal magazine, which IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture that Watsen had carefully prepared.
"For us at IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and thrived for a century because it stuck to its principles and didn't shrink from changing everything around it.
And that allowed us, over the course of our first century, to transform technology, business, and society.
We hope to do even more in the next hundred years", said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director, in a statement to mark the anniversary.
A well-thought-out system
Watson had already been providing social care for his employees in the 1930s, in a similar way to the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people were among the first American employees to have paid leave, insurance from the employer, plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a thoughtful reward system for the best innovators and traders.
IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are equally sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in promoting talent from the start - one of the first companies in the world to end all discrimination against IBM - and could choose to do so.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisan will be replaced at the head of IBM next year by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, holding the positions of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has been doing what it calls online brainstorming in recent years, which is where a lot of future strategies and innovations come from.
It is no wonder - ideas are plentiful, the company employs almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakable position in the business ensures a strong image for the company both internally and externally.
"From the beginning, IBM was more of an institution than a mere technology company", said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with technology", added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasises, there is a difference between being present on the market or shaping it directly by being present.
IBM, known in the United States by its familiar "Big Blue" logo, has grown over the last century into one of the largest companies in the world.
It's one of the most versatile technology companies in the world -- IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible array of products -- from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all the American technology companies, IBM holds the most patents and five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include, for example, ATM machines, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes and the floppy disk.
With a market capitalization of about $220 billion, IBM was the second largest technology company this year (behind Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking Ahead
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is about moving forward, so don't get emotionally attached to the past", says Samuel J. Palmisano.
So IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms -- and if they don't work, they can leave.
Unlike Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Promising technologies
IBM's profits are mostly derived from services, with software and hardware each accounting for one fifth.
In 1990, hardware was still the most represented with a share of more than 50%.
IBM has sold $15 billion of low-yield assets since 2000, but has invested $58 billion in the acquisition of future technologies during the same period.
IBM continues to invest in these companies after 2008, when the modern financial crisis first swept the world like a storm.
IBM also remained true to the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the midst of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that the company IBM is surviving the current crisis without any damage.
IBM's stock has rocketed 120% since 2008, and the company's net profit is growing continuously.
The corporate slogan of IBM is: everything can change - only not the values.
This is why we can expect this flexible giant to cope with the next crisis.
IBM history: from cheese grinder to space flight
The company IBM (International Business Machines), founded in New York a hundred years ago, had a rather complicated name at the beginning - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924, originally as a trademark for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the future IBM company was laid by the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1880s.
They had technologies such as the famous punch card clocks to record the beginning and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the supervisory board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the rival company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
This leader then even eclipsed the founders of IBM - Watson's ideas are still the basis of the company's invincible culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began manufacturing and distributing all kinds of machines for the trade - from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four decades that Watson ran the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
He was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the executive chair for forty years, until his son, Thomas Watson Jr., replaced him.
Under his leadership, IBM began work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960's, IBM engineers and computers helped NASA to guide spaceflights to Mercury and Saturn and, in 1969, to the famous moon landing.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that set the standard for computing at the time was released in 1981 as the IBM 5150 computer.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but also bought the consultancy division of PricewaterhouseCoopers, thereby entering fully into the consulting and high valueadded services business.
The strategy that IBM has been using for the last three years is the concept of a 'Smart Planet'.
It embodies the intention to use technology in a smart way in areas that were not even planned before, such as improving the situation in transport and urban management.
In the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which is designed to help retailers manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM opened a branch in what was then Czechoslovakia - the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The central office for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague, and it also has a world-class research team working on voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, you can keep that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became the lover of Iveta Bartošová (45) from the protector, Darina still remained hopeful that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now she has finally run out of patience and has set clear rules for the rest of her life.
"Josef can come home, but not as my partner", explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová took refuge in her own house, she would have never dreamed of what would happen to her husband.
When Iveta, at her urging, left after 30 days and returned to Říčany, Josef went with her.
He even publicly confessed that he loved her.
In time, Darina became resigned, even seemed to be reconciling with her unfaithful husband - but now she was giving him up for good.
Rychár doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová leaves in the future, he will not be welcomed with open arms.
"He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to end his days in our home, I will not chase him away".
"Not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person with whom I still have certain ties", revealed Ms. Rychtářová, who also said that she had already separated emotionally from him and insisted only on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina locked the back door on him, Josef has been carrying with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing will change".
"My wife wants a paper marriage, and I respect that".
"The company keeps going, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I do the shopping".
"I talk to Darina as usual, except that we don't share a bed", said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to stop her.
"We're not sleeping together, so I don't care if she has a boyfriend or who she has a boyfriend with.
I know that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility.
The worst female vice, how are you?
When asked to name some typical female vices, men invariably shake a few handcuffs.
Dear women, do you recognize yourselves in the following lines, in which we are going to pass some unseemly revue again, which makes the blood in the veins of the men?
Shopping addiction
Does their husband accuse them of being shopaholics?
Do you have to buy at least one Hader a week?
You like to go shopping, and you like to get a little extra for the specials?
Then it must be a weakness in your case.
At least some women are aware of this and try to keep their shopping impulse under control.
But seriously, what woman can afford to wander through a clothing store looking for a good-fitting outerwear without trying on all the outerwear in the cabin (in all possible color combinations)?
While shopping is a hobby for most women, it is often a living hell for men.
Think about how many times they've told their husbands to stay out of the house.
Constantly Discontented
"Am I not too fat?"
"I should lose at least five pounds - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do you even like me?"
Does that sound familiar to you?
- I did?
Then you're probably one of those women who's obsessed with how she looks.
This is not to say that you should let yourself go, but many men are allergic to their wives' constant complaints about their appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with increasing frequency of the complaints, the women are more and more intolerable.
Order and Cleanliness First
It's a battle against windmills.
Clean windows, tile and dust, and rinse the tub - at least twice a week.
Do you berate your partner for stepping on the clean tiles with dirty shoes again, or do you scold the children because the freshly rinsed sink is dirty again, or because the glass door on the living room cabinet has fingerprints on it again, when it takes so much effort to polish it?
If you suffer from this "deviance", you should know that nothing is too much and that order and cleanliness in family life are not the first priority.
This excessive desire for cleanliness can eventually damage relationships and, above all, the peace of the family.
Stinging
"Dirty gym shorts go in the laundry basket".
"Are you sure you want to put those old socks on again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor".
When your partner is subjected to such tirades, you should not be surprised that it will turn him on his head.
They don't mean any harm, they just want things to be in order.
If men knew this, women might not have to complain so much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clap and gossip, and then they're told off behind their backs or even slandered or formed alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to go through the who, where, with whom, how and why.
I guess all women have a little harmless gossip and rambling.
Hand on heart, I think it's the nature of women.
This is not to be confused with the most serious gossippers, for whom nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone around them and who pose a significant danger, especially for women's groups.
Jágr and Voráček help Philadelphia to the win with their assists
Ice hockey forward Jaromír Jágr had a big part in the 5-3 win of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina with two assists in the NHL Monday game and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The 39-year-old ice hockey star's overview was used in both cases by Claude Giroux, who added an assist and was named the best player of the match.
Two assists in the same game were also recorded by Jágr's teammate Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jagr told reporters he had a great night for Giroux.
"I'll tell him before the game that he's gonna pull a hat trick today".
That's what I felt".
"Sometimes you get that feeling", said Jágr, whose action led to Giroux scoring on the Flyers' first shot.
A little later, the second hit had a "Czech track".
Voráček fought back to take the puck behind the Hurricanes' goal and put it between the circles before the successful Maxim Talbot.
With one second to go in the first third, home team player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-handed, but the Flyers took the second.
I am not going to vote against this.
He scored his third goal in a collaboration with Jágr, then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three", Jágr said of his center.
"I never thought I'd end my career playing with a hockey player like him".
"I'm so happy for you".
"I'm cutting my play to myself".
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates played their game on me, and now the game is turning around", Jágr grinned.
Carolina made the game even more dramatic - with Tuoma Ruutua's goal and Dwyer's penalty kick, the game was close to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complications by winning two to one.
"Pronger has been excellent in our zone".
"He caught the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) moved to more distant posts".
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out", Voráček said of the game's final hit from his point of view.
With this win, Philadelphia has moved to the top of the Eastern Conference.
Czech defensive player Jaroslav Špaček of Montreal was injured in the game against Buffalo and was ruled out in the second third with an upper body injury.
The Candiens, along with their experienced Beck, also lost their lead with an unforced penalty shoot-out of 2:3.
One of the penalty shots failed to turn Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the points lost, the home team's coach was probably hurt by the high number of sickness-related absences in the defense - they finished the game with only five defensive players.
"This is bad".
"We finished the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young players".
"But there is nothing to be done, we have to deal with it", said Jacques Martin.
"At every turn, one wave of attack after another, and we had nothing to do".
"We should have made the game easier and got the puck out of our third".
There were still reserves here", said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended 30 shots from Tampa Bay, making a significant contribution to the 5-2 win over Winnipeg.
The Jets, who ended a five-game losing streak, had five different shooters on their scores.
Changes in rice prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five authorised state-run travel agencies in the then ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies then mainly sold only trips to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, and only selected people were allowed to travel to the West.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean Peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea, and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when you were also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern bloc (including Czechoslovaks) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If a citizen of the C.S.S.R. wanted to travel to Poland or even the Soviet Union, for example, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then, travel agencies offered trips to the West, but then you had to buy huge snakes or spend the night in a sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
It was not that way, either.
The so-called foreign currency - the condition for a trip to the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, and without a currency peg it would have been impossible to raise the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in the interior, no wonder the Czechs bought countless weekend homes and Danes - a habit that continues to this day.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution by the Czechs.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries all over the world.
A huge paradox, which is no longer recognised today, is that until 1989 it was impossible to travel to Croatia, the most popular holiday destination of the Czechs, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
From the beginning of the 1990s, the requirement to exchange currency was abolished in neighbouring Western European countries, which led to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
For a long time, the Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their trips to the West, and everyone wanted to have been there at least a few days.
The Czech holidaymakers, for example, slept in a tent in the park when travelling to Paris, since who could afford to stay in a hotel or a guesthouse at that time?
A typical feature of Czech trips abroad was a trunk full of canned goods, beer and sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely convertible Czech koruna - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and, as a result, average wages rose, and 1997 was another important year.
The increase in demand for travel has led to the fact that after 1997 travel agencies began to arrange regular travel by charter flights, which, thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts, made air travel incredibly cheaper compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, had already had currency-free payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-samet travel came in 2000 when, thanks to high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - Thailand - was made.
Since then, direct charter flights with Czech passengers have been taking off to distant sunny lands every year, and this year, 12 exotic destinations are being flown directly from the Czech Republic.
Every year, about 100 000 Czechs travel to exotic countries!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, which definitely put our country among the highly developed countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time, the Czech people spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than CZK 15 000 per head for a single holiday including the cost of the holiday destination.
The General Assembly is to find a new chairman - another deadlock threatens.
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months, and the threat is that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the helm of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general assembly in Nymburk on Thursday.
The Commission has not yet reached an agreement on the electoral system.
And without that, there can be no voting on the three potential successors.
Three players are interested in managing Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, urging his colleagues to come together and find a strong personality who could lead football in the future.
Only in the post-Hashek era did the old quarrels between the two chambers of the Federation, which could not agree on a common candidate, break out again.
This was clearly shown on 16 September when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates to the General Assembly had come to the People's House in the Smíchov district of Prague in vain, because the negotiations had not led to any result and it was not just about the election itself.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the European Parliament is not excluded from voting in the elections.
On this one point at least some agreement was reached, which was also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, which considered that representation on a proxy basis was not appropriate.
However, the dispute over the electoral system continues.
The Commission's proposal is to be put forward by the Council and the Council together, and to the Council as a whole.
Even though the perceptions of choice changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is, how do you go about it in the third round to avoid a stalemate?
"The point of contention is whether to act in accordance with the statutes or whether a completely different model has to be found", said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of FAČR, who represents professional football in management.
The third round is won by the candidate who receives the largest percentage of support in the Chamber for which he is running.
Moraine is reportedly willing to compromise on the candidate who gets the most votes from both chambers.
The Czech side, on the other hand, insists on the condition that the winner of this percentage vote must obtain at least a two-thirds majority.
The European Parliament has adopted a resolution on the situation in the Middle East, which calls for the EU to take action to combat terrorism and to ensure that the rights of the Palestinian people are respected.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, even though it seems that the constitutional electoral system is the one that most suits Pelta of all the candidates.
"My wish is that the elections be held as much as possible in accordance with the Constitution".
"So that no nonsensical alternatives are devised, as in the last general meeting", declared the owner of the (football club) Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his comments differentiated himself mainly from Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
He believes that the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and that the candidates will also work together constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football World Cup today would certainly help to calm the minds".
"When football is on the euphoric wave, the willingness to cooperate is greater", says the Jablonec official, who brings the greatest experience of all three adepts, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous".
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there is a certain effort to 'correctly adjust' the regulations for their own purposes".
"Therefore, a new blockage at the general meeting is not excluded".
"I hope, however, that common sense will prevail in the end", Rajchl said.
There is no time to reach a consensus.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generalisation will be complete by the qualifying match.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, among others, were to fly to Podgorice, could not take off in the morning in Prague due to a technical malfunction and so they were eagerly looking for a replacement variant, how to still bring part of the executive committee to the location of the barrage-inspiel.
In the end, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday, will be decisive.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to have brought the divided parties within the country's largest sports federation to a compromise.
The stakes are high: government funding, the credibility of Czech football and the forthcoming general assembly of ČSTV, which is expected to give Czech sport a new direction after the financial problems at Sazka.
Paclík is going to fight for the position of chairman because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner Footballers, had been able to pick out a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have engaged in the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I'd fight for him and not run for reelection".
"But in the current situation, we have not been able to find such an adept", Paclík ČTK said.
The main reason for Paclík to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the function of chairman for one year only, i.e. until 2013, until the end of the Ordinary General Meeting.
In the chairman's position, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who was not too involved in football.
"I have personally spoken to some of the people who could be considered".
"I can't believe that some people told me that they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have been changed", he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disrupts Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For this reason, Paclík considers it unacceptable that Pelta should be the chairman.
"His victory would preserve the present situation and prevent any progress in Czech football".
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be doubly bad for football", Paclík stressed.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelta's name was mentioned in connection with telephone intercepts in a corruption investigation, but Pelta was not punished.
"I don't know what prestige a victory by Pelta should bring to football".
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", said Paclík, who has now calmed down a bit on his earlier statement that "he will sell Pilsner FC if Pelta becomes chairman".
If Paclík wins the election on Thursday, he could, however, envisage a future collaboration with Pelta.
Another candidate, Rajchl, who Paclík supported before the October general assembly, which ended in a fiasco, also thinks so.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I would go to".
"He has great ability".
"I could imagine him as the manager of the national team, for example".
"But I don't think he's capable of running the union as a manager".
"I don't stick my nose in things I don't know anything about", said Paclík, who caused a stir in September when he was behind the recall of the refereeing panel with Luďěk Macela at the helm, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself says he feels he is fit to be the president of the association.
And he's also been the boss of Pilsen since last summer, who celebrated their first league triumph in May with his support.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it".
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal committees, which can lead to unpleasant situations", said Paclík, who does not hide his antipathy towards Sparta boss Daniel Křetínský, for example.
He sees as one of his priorities the strengthening of the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby the political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax flows into sport.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should be focusing on".
"When it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their reasoning, but they also have to say clearly where the money goes", he said.
Paclík also does not see his connection to the Pilsner Klub as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "bipartisan".
Pelta is in turn connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
"That's not ideal".
"I do not think it makes much sense to transfer my shares in Pilsner Klub to a third party and then return after a year and a half", Paclík explained.
Pelta promised new FAČR rules which would eliminate any future stalemate.
Two days before the general assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would make sure that the FAČR gets new statutes that rule out future disputes over the electoral system from the outset.
The Jablonec official is confident ahead of Thursday's Nymburk hearing and believes that the election campaign will surely be defused if the Czech selection is successful.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and raising funds in the event of his election.
He decided at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general assembly and so he wanted the two-month break to help him defend his ideas about the management of football and to present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels are devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday".
"He feels it is high time that the association is headed by someone", says the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonecer Club but also acted for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria of the times of Ivan Hašek is responsible for the current problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, the June General Assembly approved statutes that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman as of September", said Pelta.
He used the revision of the most important document of the Citizens' Association as a bait for the delegates.
"If I become chairman, I will take personal responsibility for it and I am prepared to take personal responsibility if it does not work out".
"This is a matter of principle, without which he cannot exist", Pelta maintains.
Furthermore, he does not try to distance himself from his opponent.
Earlier he had announced that he could envisage a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes for his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who again did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
He has been involved in football for over a year and has already achieved some success".
"His attacks were demeaning, however, and many people were shocked by his campaign".
"That is why many now doubt his true character", Pelta said to his opponent, who is likely to remain true to the proclamations he made in September.
He believes that his greatest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lower leagues to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all affairs - from the Bohemian Cause to the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal".
"I would immediately afterwards rush into negotiations with the private and public sectors to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football", the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean any personnel purges.
"I would have to familiarize myself with the work of all the employees", he said to Strahov, who was understandably nervous about the long-standing anarchy.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a regulation on the European Union's financial contribution to the European Union's budgetary procedure.
"If the only issue is how to vote in the third round, then we'll get past it".
"Football needs credibility and it will only regain it if it finally has a new leader", Pelta remains optimistic two days before what could be the decisive day of his career as a football official.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR under him will start working hard
If the former vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected the new chairman of the Czech Football Association at the general assembly on Thursday, it would allegedly upset many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, we will start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work started by the previous chairman Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole".
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national teams, professional football and youth football".
"I'm not saying that I want to do everything alone", Rajchl told ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore I want to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area".
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football progresses in each segment by leaps and bounds".
Many would not be thrilled about this because instead of just criticising the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves", he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I have considered not running at all.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that I have people behind me who don't constantly throw clubs between my legs and question every step I take", he said in explaining why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I should not give up because others would do the same".
"This is trust that you cannot afford to lose", he said.
He is also said to be motivated by the fact that he is allowed to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we've done a lot of work, and I don't want to throw it away".
"Processes have been started which will probably only be valid for a few years and I would hate to see anyone stop them", he said, expressing his concern that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - was elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic approaches and that's something Mirek Pelta does not bring".
"The people behind him are mainly those who would make football so that it would be only for the chosen ones".
I may be accused of some things, but not of being biased".
"I try to be objective".
"I want football for everyone because then everyone is happy and not just the chosen ones", Rajchl observed.
He also denies the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even though some people say otherwise, I really intend to do the best I can for the Moors".
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which would then be promoted to the first league".
"Then it could not happen that today only three clubs from Moravia play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia", Rajchl says.
Now that the head of the Pilsner Klub, Tomáš Paclík, has joined the fight for the post of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-chairman and now sees clear successes behind me", said Rajchl, who also sees the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unfavourable contracts, the agreement on television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for the fact that the association is not pulling a single string.
While he says that Pelta "is disqualified from the outset to help Czech football regain confidence", he sees the second rival - Paclík as a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question the excellent work he has done in Pilsen in just one year".
"If elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek started and obviously he would not change the composition of the committees".
He would certainly not want to turn things in his favour", Rajchl says of his rival.
The Most Beautiful Pools in Europe
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
The European Union is a major player in the world's transport and communications industry, and it is the world's largest supplier of transport and communications equipment.
A book that shows you where the best places to go are in the water.
When Iris Meder went on research trips in the past year and a half, one thing was always in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying on her back, she gazed up at the intricately designed domes, swam toward the marble pools that awaited her at the edge of the pool, and marveled over meticulously restored youth-style swimming pools.
If she liked a bath, she would quickly record it in her notebook - including interesting details about the building's construction and history.
More than 200 swimming pools were explored by architectural historian Meder in this way - and she presents them in her recently published book "Badgefreuden": Volksschwimmälen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She visited 13 countries on her "journey to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
Meder says that she has no problem with sports - only water.
The only annoyance is that swimming fans have to put up with blue tiles and chlorine tanks, while joggers can breathe in the enchanting scent of spruce forests or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools have to be so ugly", says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths".
Water surface doubled architecture
The wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are served, says Meder.
And if the builders have put effort into it, swimming pools can be a real treat: "In bathrooms, instead of a floor, you have a water surface".
"It is transparent on the one hand, but it also reflects the beauty of the whole building".
Everything is doubled visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, diving boards.
The small-format picture book "Badfreuden" (Bad Pleasures) contains 190 pages of information on the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all it makes you want to dive into the blue.
Meder, a pool collector, discovered some remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent healing baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-rich reservoir in an ancient karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath with basins filled with alkaline water, located in a flask-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, many outdoor heated pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: while the Dachbad in Zurich has the whole city in view, the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton has a view of the snow-covered Arlberg - and: in the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe the hustle and bustle on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from three open shells, while the mountains of the Ötztal valley rise to the sky in the background.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not every pool has the pool collector's meter for the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, and the Árpád Bath in Békescsaba, Hungary, smells so strongly of heating oil that you would hardly believe that you have landed in a health spa.
The smell comes from the almost black alkaline hydrocarbonated healing water, the slime of which sticks to your skin as you slide into the pool - a unique wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was disappointed in one place in her search for beautiful bathing sites: when she wanted to visit the open air and sunbathing in the Czech town of Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a closed area.
The 1902 bath designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic has since been closed.
As Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
But the decline has been countered by a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
The bath has been built in three phases, and not only are there Romanesque elements from the time of its construction in 1844, but there is also a Moorish Alhambra-style hall that was added around 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite swimming pool of pool expert Iris Meder - and not just because it originates from the Black Forest.
"It is an achievement to combine so many different styles of construction into one great unity", says Meder.
With a palace like this, the thermal pool is obviously a side issue.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank sheds light on raw materials business
♪ I'm not gonna let you down ♪
Does Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the CEO wants to make a decision.
- Hamburg - The other
For the German people, the situation is clear: according to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of those questioned even want Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to get out of the business because it is exacerbating the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges drive up prices - and that banks are therefore complicit in the global hunger problem.
The campaign of the consumer advocates is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are similarly active.
The original purpose of commodity bets was to protect traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the gamblers have become uncoupled from supply and demand - and are profiting at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike its US rivals, Ackermann responded to the criticism by promising to investigate the allegations and saying that no deal was "worth risking Deutsche Bank's good reputation".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations in the Foodwatch report.
The audit is expected to be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank - together with recommendations on how to deal with them.
The Bank's management will then announce the consequences of this decision at the end of January.
The end result could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even a complete reversal.
Ackermann is tinkering with his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but he reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "The bet on rising food prices is particularly dramatic in showing how reckless banks are damaging the public good today".
Ackermann is now particularly obliged as the chief bank lobbyist.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all investments in which money is used to bet on food prices", said Bode.
"Whether Mr Ackermann is concerned with starving people or with the reputation of Deutsche Bank".
Ackermann's insight is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to present a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not be changing his seat on the supervisory board.
He could improve his image by abandoning the controversial agricultural speculation.
And he hardly cares about any possible losses - his successor would have to deal with them.
One in two would abandon their commodity plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Forsa Institute polled 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Just 11 percent consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers facilities where food prices are bet on.
Many bank customers would also take personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: One in two would abandon all the facilities where money flows into commodity speculation, according to the survey.
Forty-three percent would advise acquaintances not to use such a bank, and 49 percent said they would consider quitting their account and moving to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The Changed Pavilion
It 's written by Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural story with highs, lows and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World Fair won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and decayed.
Now it's being reopened as a museum.
If modern postwar architecture is full of clear forms, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair is a striking and famous example.
Schwäzers Pavillon was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus gun-shaped annex in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
After the World Exhibition, his pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, was erected in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna Southern Railway Station, rebuilt and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century was opened in it - the "20th House" was called it.
But the building was not suitable as a museum, not in terms of space and technology - no walls to hang art, no good climate.
But it was used until contemporary art in Vienna found a new home.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and falling more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday night, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens its first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every way.
The new beginning was made by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Galerie Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a doctorate in art history with a considerable career in her youth as an ice skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, pushed the rebuilding with politicians and monumentalists, she obtained public funds and private sponsors and fixed the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there was to be a café and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the execution, Krischanitz was the ideal cast.
Not only because he had sensibly rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he had studied with Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology and the pavilion was a "monstrously important place" for him, where he had viewed the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness in its relocation to Vienna and its reuse.
The current conversion had far more serious problems: the building was "a waste of energy", says Krischanitz.
The glass facade window profiles were replaced, fibreglass insulation was installed and the glass roof was replaced with special safety glass.
Cold-bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two basements made room for the new use, a lowered light trench between the house and the street provides for the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors are still there, the house is painted in the old red-brown rust-proof colour.
And the movie theater is still exactly the same as it was.
And all under the strict supervision of the Monument Authority and on a small budget.
"Often, a material had to be found that was good and cheap and that the Monument Protection Agency liked", says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the stresses, problems, and alterations, the building has remained flexible and light.
The European Parliament has been asked to vote on the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and yet it wants to "awaken the right consciousness".
In this case, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because an urban development has happened: around the Swiss Garden the completely newly planned "Mainbahnhofsquartier" is being built, with office and residential buildings.
And another stroke of luck may occur: the 21st house could be reinforced by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and it is heard that she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss Garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package worth millions
The railroad has devised a crisis plan to prevent train failures in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
According to a newspaper report, Deutsche Bahn is spending over 70 million euros extra this year to combat winter-related train delays and cancellations.
The newspaper "Bild" reported in advance, citing an internal crisis plan, that investments totalling around 300 million euros were planned for 2015.
The aim is to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The plan includes doubling the number of internal and external staff for snow removal on railway installations and platforms to 16,000.
The objective is to clear tracks of snow and ice by the time the train starts and to clear 90% of the tracks needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, railway boss Rüdiger Grube warned after a summit meeting with government and industry about train cancellations and delays this winter.
Last winter the railway had considerable problems in passenger traffic, partly due to a lack of reserves in difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Federal Railway Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been working for years to make axles of ICE trains have to be checked in the workshop much more often after an ICE had an axle break in Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays a million dollar fine in the US
After the tumult over the boss Josef Ackermann, new trouble comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if Deutsche Bank's problems at home were not enough, the industry giant is now catching up with its past in the US: The Frankfurt Institute is paying $145 million (106 million euros) in a settlement to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of large banks of having lured the cooperative banks into buying the financial products with false promises; they had downplayed the risks.
Such securities lost much of their value during the financial crisis, and the banks were dragged down.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court", said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not admit any liability in the settlement.
The same applies to Citigroup, which has committed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairwoman Debbie Matz welcomed the agreement between the two funds.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US cooperative banks and intervenes in bankruptcies to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to recover billions of dollars in damages.
The comparisons now made are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also gotten in the way of other major banks, suing JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs this summer.
The mortgage securities in question are mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, it became a disaster for a lot of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the events are several years old, there is a strong wind blowing against the banks in the United States.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits to seek redress or to punish wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has been the biggest cause of the lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of overcharging the two US government-owned real estate companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions totaling some $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also facing a complaint from the FHFA, which concerns several transactions totalling USD 14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the City of Frankfurt to accept 'substantial losses', without however specifying an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and declared that it would defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with 10 billion in his name .
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he's bought more than $10 billion worth of stock.
The great American investor Warren Buffett has always said that he would not invest in IT and computer companies because the long-term development of these companies is hard to predict.
But now, he's read the IBM financial reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM was mainly a service provider and procured computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a financial triumph.
As a result, the IT giant IBM can now call itself "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett has now revealed on CNBC, the US business channel, that he has bought 10.7 billion dollars worth of IBM stock since March.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become one of IBM's largest shareholders, with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that even IBM had no knowledge of the engagement until now.
He praised the management, which had still managed to make decent profits even during the economic crisis.
"You did a great job", Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been investing in the lucrative IT services such as data centre management for some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consultancy services and powerful business computers.
Buffett had avoided tech companies until now.
He says he only invests in companies that he understands the business of.
Instead, Buffett intervened with a freight railroad, a lubricant manufacturer, or a mechanical engineer.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns some 80 subsidiaries and holds shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Munich Re.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, had built it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet his life-style is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His near-honest sense of money earned him the nickname "Oracles of Omaha".
After Buffett's investment was announced, IBM's stock price rose 1% before the stock market closed.
Big Blue, as IBM is known, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he didn't want to get into.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The Threat is palpable
After the discovery of the Zwickauer cell, the Turkish media have cast doubt on the German rule of law.
One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a Greek entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
The Turkish people and the German Turkish population in Germany are reacting to this news with fear and anxiety.
For many German-Turks, a long-dead ghost is returning: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
The right-wing extremist network uncovered, however, reveals a scale whose dimension is still far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology rising again?" was the headline of the Turkish newspaper Habertürk's online edition.
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was a V-man of the Constitutional Guard and expresses concern that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted with caution: it held a memorial vigil outside the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend to remember the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin had celebrated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish employment agreement together with German and Turkish politicians.
The whole thing was staged in cheerful colours as a success story.
The headline of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X" that discusses the background of the murder series is "Germany's gift to the fiftieth".
The German edition of Hürriyet also makes this connection.
"It's starting to stink", is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He stressed that people had been murdered who paid taxes and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
The police's actions and their subsequent success in the search are discussed in German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not think of looking for suspects in right-wing extremist circles much earlier.
Some are at least rhetorically prepared to take drastic measures: 'If we continue to be stranded here, the migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves and to arm themselves.'
"That's probably the best way to protect yourself".
"The quality of the education and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network very much depends on the inner peace in Germany", writes "Selen".
The attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s illustrate what it means when internal peace in Germany is in danger.
The photo of the Solingen fire ruin is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memories.
The European Parliament has been very active in this area, and I think that is why we must continue to support the European Parliament's efforts to ensure that the European Union is able to play its part in the peace process.
The attacks, however, have heightened the feeling of hostility on the Turkish side.
Don't repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at the time criticised the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech how many tributes the local Turks had paid.
It's like a man's worth is measured by his tax dollars.
The current coverage in the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the Turkish rule of law has since been.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive investigation and reassessment of far-right terrorism in Germany, this time we need open words.
The scandal bank of the Zürich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has been sliding from one crisis to the next ever since.
Now a German will do it.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think of it that way.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it became known in July that he would take on an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Federal Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was delighted to be seen in public, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity, and dropping friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
"UBS has done the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But by September, it was clear that things were going to be different.
A UBS dealer in London had bypassed all the bank's security systems and embezzled some 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker famous not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the UBS board has since been considered a victim as well - and all the questions are: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been announced that Weber will be advising the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over as chairman of the board in May - not in 2013, the bank announced on Tuesday.
Axel Weber is going to have a hard time.
He is not a banker, but an economics professor and a central banker, and he certainly needed a period of in-service training.
He then suddenly takes over the strategy of a bank which has just proved once again that it is entitled to the title of 'Europe's biggest scandal bank'.
Because UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand it has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, will be spared the once proud Swiss bank.
It started with the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She had combined the image of the discreet and solid, but also exuberant Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very big number in investment banking.
So, for example, in 2007, UBS, on the one hand, managed $1.6 trillion of money from wealthy clients, more than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it had moved up as an investment bank into the league of the world's largest banks.
That was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later long-time professor of banking in Zurich, says: "I always presented UBS to my students as a model of a good bank".
"From today's perspective, you ask yourself, 'How could I have been so wrong?'
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it became clear for the first time that something was wrong at UBS.
In mid-year, Peter Wuffli, the CEO, resigned unexpectedly, having been considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, they figured out why he'd left.
The bank's investment arm had become bogged down by subprime securities and had to write off billions.
To this end, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
And she did find investors, but investors that some people would have ignored until a few minutes ago: an opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund so secretive that you couldn't even tell its name.
But that was only the first blow.
Things got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions in losses, and the chairman of the board of directors, Marcel Ospel, who was still the second highest paid board member in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, disaster struck: UBS was on the verge of collapse and had to be bailed out by the State because of its financial crisis misinvestments.
The National Bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a convertible bond, which allowed it to become part owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it realised how dramatic it is for a small country to host such large banks.
Finally, UBS' balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times the size of Switzerland's economic output (see graph).
"Once again, we would not be able to save UBS", says banking researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated to the tax dispute with the United States and agreed to release the data of wealthy clients who may have evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it agreed to pay $780 million in restitution for unjust profits from these transactions, including penalties.
UBS thus admitted more or less openly to having assisted in tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was never the same.
The resignation of the CEO and the chairman of the board of directors followed.
And the exodus of client funds.
In a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both core business areas: in investment banking, through speculative misconduct, and in asset management, through its support for tax evasion.
And just when things were a little bit calmer, just when you thought UBS was going to be all right again, there's this unfortunate merchant story: a single merchant has been sued for 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is wrong.
And it becomes apparent that the risk management in investment banking is still clearly not working.
"The Adoboli case has shown that risk control has changed too little", says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the University of Zurich's Institute of Banking.
The CFO of a major German bank is also convinced: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have control over risk".
It was precisely the idea of prudence that had long ago led the Swiss bankers to become the guardians of the world's great wealth: no too great risks, but security for money - even if the world collapsed beyond the Alpine Republic.
The Swiss bank vaults had become a symbol of unwavering reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly fine chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the large Swiss private bank - it is just a little bigger.
It's a classic situation.
The bank has its headquarters on the Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main train station to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are sumptuous, the store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's are found here amongst Swiss tradition shops like the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks have resided here, from the National Bank to the Credit Suisse Palace to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are marble-clad, in front are thick leather chairs, next to the bank logo is a large sign indicating the "Safe".
UBS knows what the customer wants here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank was eventually displaced by both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse - or, as the head of a small Swiss private bank believes, betrayed.
He doesn't want to see his name in the paper, because like all Swiss bankers, he does business with the two big banks.
UBS had become too large, he said, particularly in investment banking, where the angel banks had also spread.
The Swiss would have no say in the matter.
"And if they do, they have long since adjusted to Anglo-Saxon customs".
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that transformed UBS, first by giving it high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the governing coalition of the small country of seven million people decided on the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, were allocated by politicians to save the big bank facing bankruptcy.
How did this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into a giant group.
A bank was created which was already too big for the small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and kept growing.
The two different precursors of UBS, a wealthy but dormant bank focused on wealth management in Zurich and a poorer but more internationalised bank, were complementary.
Suddenly, the international investment bankers had a lot of money at a bargain price, which they could use to spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this ascent of UBS: Peter Wuffli, UBS's CEO from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team", says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who worked his way up from the bank clerk to the top".
But Ospel relied on Wuffli to finish.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake: "He thought his models were reality", says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case".
Tragically, perhaps.
Obviously, the overconfidence came before the fall.
UBS employees remember the executive meetings where CEO Wuffli kept repeating the same slogan: "Get rid of Goldman Sachs".
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She led the league tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where UBS wanted to go, to the top.
She had already succeeded in taking a few steps.
She was at the top of the forex and stock trades.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment is based on the principle of the principle of subsidiarity.
UBS has gaps in its American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, the bank and a hedge fund it had started earlier invested in American subprime assets.
It became a huge machine, packaging and distributing securities on American mortgages, but it also carried risks.
Even when other banks were looking for an exit.
"Back in the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was in flames, UBS was buying there", says banking expert Geiger.
So much euphoria, so much fall.
One manager after another had to leave when the attempts to clean up proved more difficult than expected.
The UBS Posten became a hub and is still a shaky one.
Whoever runs the big bank now has a job that's almost impossible.
He has to come up with a strategy for a bank that has lost all its obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger has an idea: to end investment banking, concentrate on wealth management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking is about to shrink, that much is clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only intended as a transitional solution when the bank unexpectedly split from its predecessor Grübel.
He has now asserted himself as the permanent head of UBS, the Zurich-based bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to its mid-1990s level.
He's got 3,500 places to go.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What's she gonna do for a living?
These are the questions Axel Weber is probably asking himself right now.
He has said publicly that he and his wife will first look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock markets
The impending recession in Europe has discouraged US investors for the first week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome were not effective.
The continent's sluggish industrial production has stifled hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens failed to prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glasses were half-full last week, not half-empty, but now the problems were back in the spotlight, said Mark Luschini of Janney Scott Montgomery.
The sales receipts were mainly financial.
The Dow Jones Indices of Standard Values closed down 0.6% at 12,078 points.
The market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points during the course of the day.
The broad S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq technology index lost 0.8 percent and dropped 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the DAX fell by 1.2 percent to 5,985 points.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has reduced its output significantly and is preparing for the end of the recovery.
In September, firms produced two per cent less than in the previous month, Eurostat reported.
This was met with skepticism by US investors: "We are not an island, we are dependent", said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to recover from a recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness in the banking sector.
The investment legend Warren Buffett confirmed this caution only: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the use of the euro in the European Union.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle over the bar and entered the U.S. tech industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM propped up the stock price of the traditional corporation and caused it to initially rise just under 1 percent against the trend in the trading flow.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett, by his own account, paid an average of $170 per share and now owns 5.5 percent.
His investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, lost 1.3 percent in the stock market.
Bank of America's bonds fell 2.6%... far more than the market.
The company is selling almost all of its remaining stake in China Construction Bank for $6.6 billion.
The Institute intends to use the net profit from the business above all to increase its capital ratio and thus comply with stricter regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased its sales and thereby limited its losses in Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent after the group collected the largest order in its history.
Emirates airline ordered 50 long-haul 777 aircraft on Sunday, putting the order at $18 billion.
Including options on 20 more machines, the volume is as high as $26 billion.
Some 710 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
719 values increased, 2281 decreased and 79 remained unchanged.
On the Nasdaq, at 1.38 billion in sales, 630 stocks closed up, 1913 stocks closed down, and 82 stocks closed unchanged.
Intelligent crows are spreading in cities
In many places, crows are considered "problem birds". But experts say that the highly intelligent animals have long since been driven out of cities.
Some people like them, others want to get rid of them quickly: Crows have been a part of the city's landscape for centuries, but in many communes residents are complaining about the dirt and noise of the animals.
The Commission is also proposing to make the necessary changes to the existing rules.
The first crows' symposium in the East Frisian void was attended by experts who said that it was impossible to get crows out of cities.
There, experts from all over the country discussed possible solutions.
They look for alternatives in the cities
The problem in cities, conservationists have also attributed to the exodus of specially protected seed varieties: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, increased building, and the felling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies of more than 600 breeding pairs are found in Soest, Westphalia, in the northwest, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project to kill crow in the county made headlines.
Critics have called the trapping of the animals in bird traps and the beating with clubs particularly brutal.
"Normal eviction, resentment, is useless", said urban and landscape planner Werner Klöver out of the blue.
The Commission has also proposed to extend the scope of the directive to cover the whole of the EU, including the European Union, and to extend it to cover the whole of the EU.
"Animals are escaping, large colonies are splitting up and moving to other places".
The only exception to this is in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get rid of them".
The problem of urban areas cannot be solved without the surrounding countryside, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner said out of thin air.
A combination of harassment of animals from sensitive habitats and offers of bait to resettle them elsewhere is conceivable.
"Information boards instead of chainsaws", on the other hand, promoted a completely different approach to animals by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens: "A pimple on the face is the best thing we can confidently endure".
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad in Schleswig-Holstein, where information about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows was provided by signs.
The project is already being taken up by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of the birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say to each other".
The intelligence and dexterity of the animals are legendary: not only do crows use tools to get a treat, but they even make their own tools as tools.
Behavioral scientists at Cambridge University recently tested the intelligence of birds by using four seed crows.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to use stones to knock down a scaffolding to get to a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined what size and shape a rock had to be to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the cunning crows had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a cylinder, the researchers placed a small bucket containing a moth larva.
The beak was used to prevent the birds from reaching their prey.
However, the researchers had wired them.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with which they then fished the bucket out of the tube by the handle.
Three of the four seed crows even succeeded in doing so at first.
Cristiano Ronaldo is the man to beat Portugal to the 2012 World Cup
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup d'état were dashed.
The favourites are Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have won the last three tickets to the European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by double-winning superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.) Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive European Championship participation perfect after the 0:0 from the penalty shoot-out.
The Czech Republic scored 1-0 (0-0) in the play-off return match against outsider Montenegro, after the first leg (2-0) was already a clear thing.
Croatia also lost 0-0 to Turkey, while Ireland won a comfortable 1-1 against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65) had been shortened twice for Bosnia.
Lu Senalic saw the yellow and red card (54).
Bosnia had already lost to Portugal in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Portugal got off to a good start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from about 30 meters to an early lead in the nets.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long-shot skills and shot from 25 meters to 2-0.
The Bosnians, who were not held in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goal scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg player from the English leader Manchester City put a headball to the bottom of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek is playing for the Czech Republic
The main focus then was on the referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided to go for Swalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial thumbs-up after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who Misimovic safely transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 European vice-champion made it clear with four goals.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also put the final nail in the coffin in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champion is now in his fifth consecutive European Championship.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to survive a scary moment in the initial phase.
The goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9.) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot from the penalty area in the 40th minute, just past Cech's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save for the already beaten world class quarter of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had pulled off (50.).
The goal just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey, meanwhile, missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 3-0 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb couldn't get beyond a 0-0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to give up his place on the 2002 World Cup third-place bench, the Croats can look forward to their fourth participation in a European Championship final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got off to a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit the post with a long-range shot in the seventh minute, attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the scorer in the goal.
But after the horror of the second, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't burn anything.
Besides Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made way for Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were also in action.
Trapattoni is going to the European Championships .
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first EM in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already secured a preliminary decision with the 4:0 victory in the first leg, in the 32nd minute in the lead.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the deadline for the adoption of the new rules to 31 December.
Ireland was pushing the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian rearguard prevent the possible leader from striking.
But in the 32nd minute, it was time.
After a disastrous defensive by the closing man Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to 1: 0.

Mass slaughter on a personal level
With compassion and generosity, Peter Englund's new book, "Beauty and Horror: A Story of the First World War, Told in Nineteen Fates", begins with a long list of characters that touch your heart.
Here's a tip on how to do it: Carefully cut out this page and make it your bookmark.
You'll get to know these people very well in Englund's novel, and these main characters will act as your GPS, your beacon of light in those few moments when you, like Englund's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and stripped of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which decides the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he aptly describes as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few big names, important treaties, famous battles, no ambassadors, raging reporters, or discussions of tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and the Beast" almost sums up the war experiences of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Each of these lives flickers like the votive candles in a church, some adding while others extinguishing.
Englund's book is different from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that World War I was merely a devastating war of position on the Western Front.
Beauty and the Beast travels with expert insight to other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are being hit by a beehive, one is celebrating Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
The war is sweeping over the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina that smells like cordite.
Imagine that you are a woman at home with your children and you hear cannon fire in the distance.
Who's coming anyway?
Hardly anyone understands what's happening or why this war is even being fought.
"Facts that were missing", notes Englund, "were replaced with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors".
"Beauty and Horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Her stories were mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other previously published material.
Their stories may be frightening or poignant, but they are most vivid in the englund of the collection of little moments lost in detail.
Many of them are about want and self-help.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he says: "Substitution, substitution everywhere".
"Supplementary coffee, fake aluminum, fake erasers, paper towels, wooden buttons. " I was just trying to get a little bit of a feel for the place.
He tells more about the substitute food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and served last with a false wooden bone), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes that were covered with wood".
He notes that "there were 837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own drive for savagery and says of war, "You feel that, after all, this is what was meant for men rather than sitting in a chair with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, and pretending that such a facade means civilization and that there is no barbarity behind one's own tight-fitting, beaten-up chest".
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die and no one will notice or care.
"If you dismiss the idea of self-sacrifice, you want to think that it is in front of an audience", he writes.
Instead, it's as horrible as "a condemned man hanged in secret".
Other observations are of the old Europe falling apart and of new forms of terror.
"The conflict increasingly became an economic competition", Englund writes, "a war between factories".
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the word-smart and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a tailored suit who slaughters while sitting behind a desk".
People behave in unpredictable ways, and there are frivolous behaviors as well as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect themselves with a sexually transmitted disease from a prostitute in order to escape the front line.
"The grotesque expression of this can be found in the trade in gonokokken poison, which soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting into hospitals", he writes.
"Those who were truly desperate rubbed it into their eyes, resulting in their remaining blind for the rest of their lives".
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes smooth and yet unobtrusive, and perfectly suited to his human task.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures the way the war "unleashed forces that were once uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books on the First World War were mostly forgeries like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "Nothing New in the West" rather than extensive history books.
Englund's band is joining an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read in a nonfiction book.
I'm not giving it away.

After an early misstep, a meticulously planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing combat helmets.
They had decided to go Monday night instead of Tuesday night because that's when there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret, and only a few high-ranking officials were informed, all others initially believed they were participating in a training exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was among them, and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was fraught with challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violated the rules of the district and gave the squatters a huge increase in public sympathy, could not be repeated.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared for this by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster drill had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials have been stepping up so-called chaos training - counter-terrorism measures that include the rapid deployment of large numbers of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was held Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came "at the last minute", said someone familiar with the orders, which was a declaration that sounded like "exercise".
"The few police officers involved, as far as I know, did not know that it was Zuccotti Park", said one person who wished to remain anonymous.
"The only people who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the senior officials in the department".
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials tried to clear the park but backed down when hundreds of protesters gathered after learning of the plans.
Officers from various police units were involved in Tuesday's operation, including task forces from across the city - hundreds of mobile officers who are typically deployed in high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day, many people come and go in the park, almost like commuters, so 1 a.m. is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people were in the park", he said.
Emergency vehicles with Jupiter lights and loudspeakers were standing by at the exit of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the pre-recorded messages blaring from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials in their light blue wind jackets entered the park, many protesters simply grabbed their belongings and left the area.
Police said no tents would be set up until 1:45 a.m. to give protesters time to pack their belongings.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said this was for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they were prevented from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the treatment of the officers was very harsh.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken pictures.
As the police moved westward through the huge mess of protesters' personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial grass and bags of clothes, their employees followed the city cleanup team, who picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside, and pictures of this were posted on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A core of protesters took up position near the camp's kitchen area in the center of the park.
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp banded their arms together.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency response officers were called to cut it off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
The police said the evacuation was completed in 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "wrong conduct and resisting arrest", he said.
The most prominent official on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of the department, the highest-ranking uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, chief of the Criminal Investigation Department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr Kelly was not "leading the operation", as Mr Browne said.
In case they should have access, a second group of officers waited on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block further south.
From these locations, the police could be seen expanding the perimeter around Zuccotti Park.
At one location, several officers, many of them with safety signs, were seen pushing people out.
About 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most violent action of the night took place in the southern part of the park.
At about 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the roof of a police car, and other protesters blew out the tires of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester were taken to the hospital.
The Union of Care Workers is going to file a lawsuit against the city for the layoffs.
The union representing hundreds of school counselors who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, saying the layoffs are unnecessary and discriminatory because of their undue impact on schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is likely the last option open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school counselors, care coordinators and other staff members, who were among the city's lowest paid employees and lost their jobs in a shake-up on October 7, described the union leader as political revenge for denying the city access to a health fund last year that the working groups were maintaining to close the budget gap.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a city council hearing last month, Dennis M. Walcott, the director of the schools, said the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A city council member shot back and explained to him that there was nothing in the budget that specified that school-assist staff would be laid off.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Department of Education about a lawsuit, and on Wednesday, there will be a press conference to formally announce the filing of the lawsuit in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
The lawsuit will name Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants and will include eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are women of color or Hispanic, like most of the helpers who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Justice, said the city had not filed the lawsuit, and thus could not comment on its individual allegations.
According to a draft lawsuit seen by The New York Times, the union focused on the number of school layoffs in the city's poor neighborhoods to support a discriminatory lawsuit, claiming that poor schools lost more workers because they were chronically underfunded.
She states that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school workers were laid off in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 workers were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of eight school assistants employed at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, "This is not a neighborhood of poor parents who can organize donations to offset budget cuts".
P.S. The 36th District budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and funds were lost when the city changed its method of calculating the additional funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" in the US commonly describes a teacher's move from a school payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred", the draft lawsuit says.
Mission accomplished, Congress ready to discuss Libya
It finally looks like Republicans and Democrats are already in Washington to agree on the Libyan insurgency.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a resolution, co-sponsored by Chairman John Kerry (Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for its successful rebellion and US troops for their "courage".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have started rebuilding their country", Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic efforts".
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House argued over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or disapproving the role of the US military in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a broad bipartisan fringe and did not come to a vote.
But that same day, that bill passed the Senate, and the House also passed a resolution to cut funding for American operations in Libya.
This put the US mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that was angry enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the ground from under him.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell to the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their tremendous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "commends the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who are supporting military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also reaffirms 'the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition of Libya to democracy'.
Will the new measures receive full support from the Council on Foreign Relations or will they divide the legislators as the June law did?
The final version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee's top Republican.
Lugars' spokesman said Monday that he has not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it's up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every congressional term for Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures, led by Republican Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area to come to a vote in the Senate or Congress at this time.
Other legislators have tried unsuccessfully to get their amendments to the vote, despite having tried many times.
Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress that cover a whole range of issues.
Some are duplicated - the same bill has been introduced in both the House and the Senate - others differ only slightly from one another.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment in the Senate alone, and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially newcomers to the Republican Party who want to polish their CV - the opportunity to boast that they "wrote" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires that both the Senate and Congress vote on a budget adjustment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit on two terms of the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson of Illinois has proposed a series of amendments that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is just as much a recurring pattern as an amendment banning flag burning.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of the states reject them.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the future of the common agricultural policy.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers introduced 77 such amendments. In the 110th Congress, 66.
The pace pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today's.
The last amendment, to be added, the 27th, was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Found, but not defeated", Giffords said in her first television interview after the assassination
Ten months after a gunman shot her at close range during a Tucson rally, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords of Arizona appeared on national television Monday night, singing solo to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow", saying the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she appeared on ABC News' "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, she struggled with words and needed help walking.
The program showed her slowly recovering from the damage caused by the bullet that split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain, and went through her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned to Congress in a surprise way to triumphantly vote for the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January bombing, which killed six people and wounded 13, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked how she was feeling, Gifford, 41, replied, "Very well".
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special that was recorded shortly before the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
This special follows Gifford's recovery since the January 8th assassination.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she is shown in a hospital bed, with a shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords is in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod of the head.
A twitch of the lips.
And then, her first words, "What?"
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: You see the congresswoman singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day in therapy, said she can't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that he had read to Gifford a daily newspaper article about the assassination on March 12 when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
Suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner is being held in a Missouri prison and is receiving forced medical treatment while awaiting trial.
"Many people died", Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard. " I was like,
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly told Sawyer, she said, "I was hit".
"So, I would say, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated'?" said Kelly.
You were just hit.
And you're gonna get through this and you're gonna get better and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Troops are more likely to feel pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness and frustration and loss.
At a whisper, a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising campaign in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, who was observed by the chief of staff and then-chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, among others, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were brought in like orphans", the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, it really wasn't.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the largely dismissive, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are being showered with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, say officials.
The public is increasingly acting as if they are sorry for the people in uniform.
"We were not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is soon to go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support the one is to squeeze us into the role of unhappy souls".
The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in conflict with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger faced by the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, there are quiet and private conversations about compassion among war veterans.
After her two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world might see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe, as they were rebels defeated and travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if an "angry, violent veteran" is hiding under the surface, said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-ranking Washington post.
During his job search, he said, he sensed that some of the interviewers were subtly asking whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after returning from combat.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to counteract the negative impressions", Cancian told his sons.
The military's lack of agility is rooted in part in the lack of American interest in war.
Battlefield achievements are rarely singled out for praise by a country with little military experience and little use of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer value military heroism in the way it was absolutely common during World War II", said Lt. Gen. David Barno, Sr., who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a service member.
Troops are recognized for the number of attacks they've endured, the number of friends they've lost, or the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, a key hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be tried for rape by military court for failure to act.
If that doesn't happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
PFC Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was October of 2008, and she was returning to her barracks in Miramar, north of San Diego, from dinner with a friend, when she met a male colleague who was carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked if he could take her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went off", Lyman said.
But the Texan brushed her concerns aside.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas", she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut".
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down, and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees anxiously await a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether a lawsuit they brought against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admissible in court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to address the widespread rape within the military and violate the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. lawyer, the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all of whom claimed that they had been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice for the alleged attacks.
Burke says they're tracking the Joint Chiefs because that's where the problem begins.
"The military is hierarchical", she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the retaliation culture?
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom may be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs putting their eggs in one basket, so to speak, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to keep the pressure up.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
The court files, which Newsweek has access to, spell out the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court ruling known as the Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries suffered by soldiers on active duty.
"The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiffs' military service", the document states.
The Department of Defense is refusing to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the distinction is only in name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contacting native women in the war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It's time the military was modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her fight: three other lawsuits besides hers are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing to sue the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
Separately, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the "personality disorder" diagnosis rape victims received in order to dismiss them from service - a common practice, according to activists like Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in its treatment of benefits for those who report sexual abuse in the line of duty.
Nine bills were introduced to Congress independently by a mix of senators and representatives from both parties, who provided a number of clues.
In 2010, the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defense reported 3,158 cases of sexual assault.
But most abuses go unreported, accounting for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases reported annually, according to the Pentagon's own estimate.
The report, published in March, also looked at prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of recorded cases were brought before military courts, half as many as civil cases.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe her attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole host of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and her attacker's blood, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was questioned by a judge during a hearing about the sex she had with her boyfriend before the assault.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read", says Lyman.
"I thought the contractions would start, so I ran screaming out of the courtroom".
"They took me to the psychiatric ward, and I remember coming out and saying to my commander, 'That wasn't his procedure.
Lyman was instructed to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder and declared her unfit for service.
She was dishonorably discharged in January 2010, so she's not getting any support.
Whether the lawsuit filed by Lyman and the other plaintiffs will proceed is speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Still, he notes, "I think they should move on".
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first challenged.
I've been a lifelong critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is a decade behind because they don't have the same incentive and the same deterrent that liability brings.
He adds: "The odds are stacked against them... but it's important for them to try".
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go its way, Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will start with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms are made", she says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are watching you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys posting their anti-immigrant views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who has confessed to committing the July massacre in Norway that killed 77 people, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time before his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find it?
It's easy - all you have to do is log in to Facebook.
"We found that it was not difficult to reach them", says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British think tank DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's cover-up of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply have to use the site's advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just like marketers have done for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with Adds, but instead of linking to a new band or a new diet product, they invited the Adds users to a survey that asked about their education, their attitudes toward violence, and their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without ever leaving their offices.
"It's a fairly new research method", says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not surprising. Online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
In a surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more rational, democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens".
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends like likes, text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating a research boom that has seen the number of scientific papers with this page's name in the title rise by nearly 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people that you wouldn't normally reach with your clipboard on the street.
"In the past, when you tried to interview people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them".
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have allowed them in", says Bartlett.
"Facebook doesn't do that - you go directly to them".
Others say the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their binge drinking on Facebook were significantly more likely to have a drinking problem than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that peer students, such as housing counselors, monitor the site and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it", Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, told the Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify at-risk children who otherwise would not have been found".
Facebook also constantly taps into the data of its own population.
The site's data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (using primarily data that only Facebook has access to - masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its vast trove of data available to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they want to or not, and to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, you allow the site to give out your personal information.
But what if Facebook users were to become part of a survey they didn't even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online anything goes.
"I don't think many users have even considered the fact that a researcher could study their profile", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she was concerned, it was just her and her friends".
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is completely honest.
On Facebook, it's impossible to know how much of what's on a user profile and in posts is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things", says Selwyn.
So despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people", he says.
"Social research must concern itself with the social - and much of social life still takes place offline".
'Cold and inhuman': Anders Behring Breivik appears in court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two shootings that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Templar of Norway", he told a courtroom of more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have been given a mandate by organizations that support the ideologies of hatred and because this supports multiculturalism".
"I recognize the laws, but I do not plead guilty".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views".
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a pre-written speech, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, with him banned from media for four weeks, and said authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in hopes of meeting Breivik face to face, others wanted confirmation that he was behind bars.
Everyone participated with the goal of making it all work out.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman", a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect".
Wearing a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik appeared calm and professional throughout the hearing, looking journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre suggestion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
Some may like to think that the July 22 attacks were the work of an individual extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But does that automatically alleviate the grief and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't", said a relative of one victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did it".
7 lessons from the late Steve Jobs interview that was shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, singling out the tech genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing in the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted this week before special screenings in major markets, is how much this creative mind understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and a self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who was eager to make charts - a man who believed that many CEOs suffered from "a disease of thought", "that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product".
In 1995, Bob Cringely created the TV series "Triumph of the Idiots" about the rise of the personal computer, and he sat down with Jobs for over an hour, in one of the rare, in-depth conversations they've ever had.
By this time, it had been 10 years since Jobs had been forced out of Apple, and he was already hard at work on his new computer company, NeXT, and looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley's interview was used in specialist reports, he says the transcript of the interview was missing on delivery.
It wasn't until after Jobs' death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly re-edited footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which is coming to the Landmark theater this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here appears surprisingly eager to explain his philosophies on technology and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
There are four times during the interview that there are longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, during which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism is revealed, when he seems impatient with Cringely's questions, prompting him to move more quickly on issues or side-effects of greater importance.
Recorded before the age of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, The Lost Interview seems somewhat uncanny, as Jobs evaluates what he thinks other companies are doing right or wrong and sets out his own vision for the future of computing.
It's one thing to read posthumous applause of Jobs' career, but to see Jobs here as the eager dreamer on the leap to greatness is something else entirely, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he went and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"During all the years in business, I always ask, "Why do you do things?" and the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done".
No one knows why they do what they do, no one in business really thinks about things.
I've seen that.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline Apple's accounting.
Bewildered by the way in which costs were recorded - usually starting with "standard costs" which were estimated on the basis of mere assumptions and then adjusted by "deviation" - he developed an automated factory which ensured that business costs could be determined to the smallest detail.
How the Pope was mocked:
Jobs talks about the Blue Box he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed you to sneak into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Jobs' enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is infectious.
He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while trawling through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent stuff around the world half a dozen times, and if you honked on the phone, it would come out a minute later on the phone next door", Jobs says, giggling.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that could control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world".
We both didn't know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, and that was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have existed without it.
Jobs goes on to tell of a glorious prank that Wozniak and he nearly pulled off when they called the Vatican via Blue Box in the middle of the night and wanted to speak to the Pope, while imitating Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself answered the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and called Bill Hewlett unprepared):
At age 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs was offered a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views of what a company was and how well it treated its employees".
Later, Jobs was one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
It was the size of a suitcase, had a small screen with a Braunschweig tube and I fell in love with it.
I would climb to the top of HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
In the interview, Jobs talks about how to invent new products spontaneously.
Early in his career, when he was building some circuit boards, he was asked by a client to put together the whole computer.
He worked on a 30-day payback schedule and had to think through both the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had with developing a computer mouse:
"I remember some pretty strong arguments... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer".
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15 and that was incredibly believable.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industry giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their stocks.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or printer, what?"
They have a monopoly on the stock, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it's] these people who ultimately run the companies and the product that push people out of decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is being eradicated by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship is necessary.
It happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They've got the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop that great idea, it changes and grows".
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
You have to make tunings, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 of these things, these concepts, and then you put them all together...
Ultimately, it comes down to taste, it comes down to trying to sort of take the best stuff that humans have created and then trying to bring those things together into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We're always shameless about stealing great ideas.
Part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for the computer industry, they would be doing fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws as court case accepts
On the day that the Supreme Court convenes behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama's health care laws, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm that is representing the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine justices met for a meeting to deliberate on the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases under consideration was a lawsuit brought by 26 states against the sweeping health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has become a buzzword among conservative activists across the country.
The justices agreed to hear the case, and in fact, a five and a half hour-long policy debate is expected in March, the outcome of which is likely to fuel the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court's decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand in court and argue that the law is flawed will likely be Paul Clement, formerly the attorney general under George W. Bush.
Clements's firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that sponsored the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group devoted to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, that challenged the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the trial.
The dinner was held a few hours after the court deliberated on the case at a Washington hotel.
The Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, a vocal opponent of health care reform, was among the first to speak out.
The guests of the dinner party?
This is not new: the two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not against any moral code.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct which governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: 'A judge may participate in benefit events of the Law and other organizations, but the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honour or guest of the program of such events.'
Nevertheless, Scalia and Thomas's extreme proximity to two of the firms involved in the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, was enough to alarm moral and government activists.
"This startling break with morality and contrary to the code is invalidating the claims of some judges, and the court is following the same rules that all other federal judges follow", said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined with lawyers at a benefit event with pending cases in court".
Your appearance and your support of a fundraising drive for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say they mix up court matters too easily with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a well-known conservative activist.
The conservatives, on the other hand, argue that it's Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the attorney general under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits were brought to trial in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from the case for bias, saying she was too committed to the defense of the law to be unbiased.
Kagan's not making any moves to do this.
Boeing wins record contract worth $ 18 billion
Emirates Airlines is ordering 50 Boeing 777 biplane aircraft with an option for 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing is selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 billion.
It is really rare news that a company gets an order for 50 of their products.
But it's a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 planes combined is a record $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is Boeing's customer: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest ever order for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order, 50 Boeing 777 twin-engine jets over the weekend.
The order for the hammer came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which brings the total list price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow.
On Monday, Boeing said Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners, which dramatically improve fuel economy and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these planes is over a trillion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing", said Neal Dihora, a stockbroker at Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high".
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the airplanes, but an increase in oil prices, which usually hurts the airlines because it's one of their biggest cost points, is not as bad because the country is making money from a higher oil price.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight bookings when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"You have a natural defense", he said.
The Emirates order confirms Boeing's leadership in the wide-body market and helps to keep Airbus' competitor SAS in check as it seeks to dominate the A350 market.
Boeing's victory at the airshow comes four months after Airbus announced it would delay the launch of its largest A350 aircraft, which will directly compete with the 777-300ER.
It was delayed to gain more trust after customers demanded a higher payload and range.
Boeing shares were up 1.5% to $ 67.94.
Sister of Mexican President Seems to Lose Election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers supported rival PRI Fausto Vallejo in the race for governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon, who apparently lost her bid to become governor of Muchoacan during the violent state election, claimed on Monday that drug dealers had swayed the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, has won the race for the governorship of the western state.
"The interference of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country", Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview the day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our poll workers ... They occupied polling stations, set up road blocks ... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]".
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are looking for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who was still leading in the polls before the election.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party PRD, currently serving as the governor, came in third place, a heavy defeat for the divided and unfortunate left-wing leadership in the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies any ties to drug dealers and is pushing the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and amphetamines.
It's the homeland of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
A PAN mayor was killed during a polling station for Luisa Maria Calderon a week before the election and numerous candidates have dropped out of the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how distasteful the election in Michoacan may seem.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will give us a bold look ahead to next year".
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is calling on India and China to help rescue the eurozone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow down the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of the Manila-based ADB, said the world's two fastest growing economies must do "everything in their power" to speed up the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) looking "pathetically" at the difficulties in Europe, and said that Asian financial support for European leadership and European resources would help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat".
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful", he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune".
"So if China and India can help, then by all means".
The European Monetary Union has been in a serious debt crisis for the past few months.
In recent days, Italy's interest rates have risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe is fuelling fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and has led to calls for the leading emerging economies to come together to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any assistance to Asia would be channelled through the IMF but said that reciprocal arrangements - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - would give European partners in Asia greater bargaining power.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its own economy suffers from falling exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent", he said.
"We are facing great challenges and we must maintain a high level of growth".
"It is not an option, it is a mandate, because where else are we going to find work for our millions of young men and women?"
Others argue that emerging economies like India have no incentive to help rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe to the 1.2 billion people in India, of whom more than 800 million live on $2 or less a day.
"At some point, they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend their holidays on the beach.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep Greece's many well-paid public-sector employees, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making institutions like the railways.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone will have "significant ripple effects" across Asia.
The ADB's forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/ is now "at risk of downgrading" due to the looming threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves against a downward trend and significant capital outflows of their vocabularies.
The Pentagon has issued a warning about possible cuts in defense spending.
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned Congress on Monday that automatic budget cuts would imperceptibly weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan and the civilian waterways.
The Pentagon is already considering $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears that more cuts of $600 billion or more will be necessary if Congress cannot reach a spending agreement.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department", Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will result in what he called a seizure, would result in 23% overall cuts as well as a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a large cut, carried out in such a reckless manner, would render most of our shipping and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts", Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily cut off a large proportion of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would almost certainly have to leave civilians on leave in order to achieve the goal".
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who sustain our military and seriously damage our readiness".
The cuts were ultimately the combat troops", said Panetta.
"While wartime contingents in the counterterrorism fight are not directly affected by the seizure, the severe interference with the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort", warned Panetta.
"Staff appointments were being cut, which would cause delays in the recruitment and hiring of staff who support the war".
"Staff salaries would be cut, resulting in late payments to wartime dealers and disrupting legal and political support".
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for more details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would usher in a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power".
"We vehemently oppose this draconian act", the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon as they released Panetta's letter.
"This is an outcome we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be forced upon us".
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be allowed to occur".
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly blunt about the potential cuts, despite having many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows he faces tough choices.
At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a bleak picture of what might be coming - a military with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors".
"It's a brigade without ammunition".
"It's an air squadron without adequately trained pilots".
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission", said Panetta in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to engage potential adversaries".
"She really makes you angry".
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta provided new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disaster, serious limitations on our global response and intervention capability, resulting in unacceptable risk in future war operations".
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to the strike, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning stages.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship, and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save up to $80 billion over the next 10 years, but proponents say it's an important next step in upgrading so that potential threats from China and other adversaries can be contained.
How to Unmask a Lie
A glance at the headlines today shows how pervasive and widespread deception and lying are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy dealing with sexual harassment allegations by several women, with both sides accusing each other of lying.
Penn State's administration is accused of perjury for allegedly withholding reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was heard over an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself by circulating denials that were quickly refuted by compelling evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is being accused of campaign finance violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it will forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton created when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories of cheating at school and on college exams are common.
There have been instances of teachers giving students the answers to the examination questions, so that they themselves could do well on their examinations.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite send a message that lying and cheating is okay.
How much deception are we experiencing?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
Many of these lies are considered to be lies of convenience.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Learning to detect lies is important for everyone, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a social game like charades, where the goal is to yell "Ha ha!" the disguise of deception is a serious field of study based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities conducting far-reaching research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Lies look you in the eye.
They don't always stutter, stammer, blush and struggle.
This does not mean, however, that such liars are difficult to detect and expose.
A trained lie detector can penetrate the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, the subtle facial expressions, the questioning and the timing.
I've spent several years researching the scientific evidence in the vast and ever-growing field of deception, and it's clear that deception is a modern skill that's easy to learn and helps us navigate our way through our complex world, especially when hiring or interviewing people or negotiating or administering is part of your professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at assessing other people, engaging their interest, controlling their own emotions, and they intuitively sense how they are perceived by others.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more often than women, and that men lie more often to protect the feelings of others, and that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that when a person is exposed as a wrongdoer, others feel less guilty about lying to that person.
How do you know when someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called baselining, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent evaluation of changes.
Observe the posture, the laughter, the quality of the voice of your subject.
They should know better when someone is usually tripping their foot all the time, so they don't falsely accuse them of tripping their foot during a meeting.
Then watch for accumulations of conspicuous verbal and nonverbal behavior.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that are ringing, not evidence of a cover-up.
People who cheat may freeze when they try to remember their story, perhaps pointing their feet toward the door or leaning toward the exit, changing their position in significant ways, or showing "post-employment relaxation", that deep, relaxing exhalation and change in posture when all the hard questions are over.
Askers often falsely signal that a job interview is over, just to look for this relaxation after the job interview.
Also, watch your subject's language.
Scott Peterson's outsider is famous for using the past tense when he claimed his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceivers may also use distant language, such as "I did not have sexual relations with this woman, Miss Lewinsky", or by repeating a tricky question in its entirety.
The most common verbal cues are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... to the best of my knowledge... to the best of my knowledge and conscience".
This makes the answer more perceptual than factual, often raising alarm bells.
There is no magic bullet to disguise lies, but you can learn skills that make disguising them possible.
Thanks to these skills, everyone is less likely to be a victim of fraud, both in private and professional life.
Controversial oil pipeline plan revised after US approval delayed
Just days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, angering labor unions while calming environmentalists, the pipeline companies are trying to re-plan the project so that it can return to normal.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will divert the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Legislature.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different path.
This came after a State Department announcement last week that it would delay a decision on federal approval for the project until it reviewed the new potential route, which would bypass the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a major underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward", Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may delay a decision until 2013, after next year's elections, though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was the responsibility of the State Department and pledged his support.
The 1,700-mile pipeline would connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do that, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate it, but labor markets love it, because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers who oppose the plan are weighing legislation to force a shift away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study by the State Department found the project would have little impact on the environment, but the energy industry source says that the Department's chief auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's adviser in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged with allegedly forcing a toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle had a hangover in the lobby of their Manhattan apartment building that scared their young daughter so much that she vomited in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk to the point of causing her to suffer from "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers", her family said in Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was on November 10th last year when stage manager Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergartener, and Genevieve were about to leave for a family outing.
While Kevin Monk was getting the car, Roseanna Monk, with her luggage and Genevieve on her arm, went into the lobby of her Riverside Boulevard building.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'Yes,' and went over to pick her up again", she said.
LaBelle angrily rebuked the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't put your daughter near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
I told her, "I don't care what you say or think".
She got mad and started yelling, using the F word and the A word, and she got really loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started to pour water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was going into hysteria.
"I told this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle ran into the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be restrained by her escort and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby was screaming so much, she said, that he had to throw up.
Later, the LaBelle family wrote an apology, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls for comment.
The suit is for an unspecified amount of damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, has said he will not charge a fee and the family plans to donate the money they receive to the children's cancer fund.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior", Davis said.
"This type of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially when it is shown to a kindergarten teacher who is carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm".
Climate change is slowing down the economy
In the first year of Mario López Valdez's government, Sinaloa saw unemployment and underemployment rise, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa as the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, who described himself as the initiator of the change and who had high hopes for economic growth, but due to the climatic adversities, growth was not possible, and the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of dollars in losses in agriculture, but also limited the growth of the national economy, causing a general decline in economic activity of 3.6% in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development of 31.16%, which had a braking effect on other economic sectors.
According to a report on the effects of the frost published by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development (Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable), 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were partially destroyed, mainly in the vegetable, corn and chickpea crops.
The decline in economic activity until November has caused unemployment to rise continuously in the Mexican state.The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, because from January to March 55 053 residents of Sinaloa were without employment, which is 4.53 percent of the working population.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is due to several factors: Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), comments that the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are seeing now is an increase in unemployment that is related to several factors, including liquidity losses in the marketplace as a result of the cuts in the money laundering legislation passed by Congress, because it is not easy for those who are prohibited from accumulating dollars to make them work for themselves, to invest them or to use them for something else", he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment also has a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country to look for work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased, partly because of the immigration problems and partly because it is difficult to find work there too, and these people stay and look for work here, which is causing unemployment to rise", he says.
Black-collar work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more difficult when one considers the high proportion of undeclared work, which according to INEGI comprises 60.38 per cent of the country's employees who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are accompanied by low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to statistics from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Governmental Agency for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5352 pesos as of September, much less than the national average of 7375 pesos.
Decline in the ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, 2011 will see the largest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last decade, with the Secretaría de Economía (the national economic authority) reporting that the FDI from January to June was $630,597, a decline of 87.74 percent compared to $5,143,312 in the same period last year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Economic Development Agency) for its part, records a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mostly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
In July, in the face of the economic crisis, the regional government applied to the National Congress for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to revitalise the economy.
Reactions
The first year of the government of Mario López Valdés made the inability of the government obvious to the representatives of the business community.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (National Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), said that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa has been really very poor this year. It's going to take a lot of work to regain the ground lost this year and in 2012 we have to double down. The efforts of everyone and especially the progress of the already well-coordinated government team have not been sufficiently coordinated", he explained.
Slow economic growth
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the freeze. One of the most important effects is a slowing economy that is not moving enough to generate an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will end the year far below our expectations", he said.
Redefining vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican Employers' Federation) in Sinaloa, said that the state must be encouraged to become more dynamic in productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done, and we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloa", he said.
There's a lot to do
The Coparmex chairman stressed the importance of developing a vision for the future that would steer government efforts in a better direction.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress in government.
"There are areas where the government has done more, but what I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work to do", he said.
Arrested for eight kilos of marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of community service for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecutor's office of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was convicted of a crime against public health - in this case, possession of marijuana for sale.
According to the file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military personnel while conducting surveillance on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite the guard post No. 80 in the locality of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white van with a black bag in a crate and a small backpack in the passenger seat, in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the seized goods were handed over to the district judge and the convict remains in the penitentiary.
Debt on construction work
The EU's new rules on the protection of the environment and the environment from pollution and other harmful substances are to be welcomed, he said.
The head of the city's social development agency said that although the construction programs have progressed, they are now in jeopardy because the state government has not paid its dues, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programs was almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent was paid by the state, and that so far only the Federación and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, which is why the completion of the project is expected to be delayed.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, even though they should have paid us a part of it in July", he said. "To be on time, we have already started the construction work and it is well advanced, but we need the money".
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the State had failed to meet its obligations, and that the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of his administration, which corresponded to the amount that the central government should have borrowed.
"We had already had this problem in the last legislature, because the State did not have sufficient economic resources, the programmes continued and this year we had to find the resources that the State had not raised in order to participate in these programmes", he explained.
Although the public authorities were obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance had been asked to speed up the administrative work and pay the outstanding part as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny".
Court approves digital TV switch in Mexico for 2015
The switch from analogue to digital signals is one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of Mexico (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional actions brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree, and by which the switch from analogue to digital signals must be postponed from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes necessary to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued the decree-law detailing the switch to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, as it did not obtain the necessary qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
The draft lawsuit, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, since the radio and television regulations are the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission of Telecommunications in Mexico), and therefore the decree would be contrary to the hierarchical principles and the reservation of law.
The only people who voted in favour of the project were Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the decree-law. After accepting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer appealed the decree-law and stopped all activities to establish digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint lodged by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Minister President expressed his disagreement with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Land government cannot regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration with general regulations.
"I also do not believe that doing so would undermine the independence of the regulator", she said, recalling that the central government is constitutionally responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, as it is the one that manages state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place around the world in recent years, and it leads to a better use of the radio spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The delay in the transition, she said, was a delay in taking advantage of digitalisation, which was a decision in the public interest, not just technical, "because it includes economic, social, political and security aspects".
These matters, she stressed, "require action by the whole system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction by the state, they contain a set of features that put the constitution in the hands of the central state government".
She recalled that many countries worldwide had already implemented the digital transition through the government, despite having highly specialised institutions.
"We cannot conclude that the government, by issuing the contested legislative decree, is interfering with the powers of the Congress, because the laws passed by the legislature are being respected", she said.
The possibility of counting ballots in Michoacán is being considered
According to PREP figures, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 still to be counted.
The possibility of single-counting is a reality in this year's elections in Michoacán, because according to the data released by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 still to be counted.
In this context, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November 9 the electoral office had adopted a series of regulations to harmonize local regulations with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had neither adapted its political constitution, its electoral law nor its law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force at this election round.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional lawsuit filed by the local legislature, judging the vote of the state delegate on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal", since the latter had no right to "decide on it or veto it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview about the possibility of counting the votes individually that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, it was now possible for the local electoral authority to count the ballots partially or fully.
The results in the minutes do not match; the minutes of the vote counting and calculation are not in existence or are not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total number of ballots that have been filled in may be counted if there is a difference of one percent or less between the presumed winner and the runner-up, provided that there is an express request at the beginning of the sitting from the party or coalition chairman who is the second of the candidates mentioned.
The vote may also be counted in its entirety if, after the completion of the ordinary count, it is found that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has been second.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second place is just 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will and testament
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapaliname mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were found on Sunday evening in Saltillo, his birthplace, where a funeral procession and a mass were held on Monday.
According to family members, the last will of the Lieutenant Colonel was that his ashes be scattered over the Zapaliname Mountains.
After a tribute, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila, along with the other victims of the Mexican Air Force plane crash, and the closest people to the colonel attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the ashes of the Lieutenant Colonel landed on the funeral home, which is located on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came.
At 5:30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, prompted by his former high school technical high school classmates and his American football team, which Felipe Bacio had joined during his preparation for high school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered over the Zapaliname mountains, as he had always told his family and friends", said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
In her view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he was living life to the full. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo at a very young age to enter the Air Force School of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some people couldn't believe it, because they thought he would be dizzy even on a truck.
His nephew, Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio, remembers him as a good man: "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man recalls that even at the age of seven, he had driven to Zapopan for his family's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died while doing what he loved best: flying a plane.
A final farewell
The Mexican Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Felipe Bacio Cortés, was honored by the people and government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military District, the Mexican Air Force, the school principal and students of the Technological Educational Institute of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and excelled both in studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he was flying crashed, along with the Secretary of State, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people from the same office.
At 18.05 the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over by the funeral home to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, in the forecourt of the barracks, where his family members were already waiting for him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers.
The abandoned bodies were found on a property off Cadereyta NL .
A few hours before the discovery, military officials introduced to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same locality in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found shot in different parts of their bodies and shot in the back in an abandoned finca in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The incident occurred at the kilometre point 1.5 of the rural road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passersby saw that the door of the country house, surrounded by a beige-brown wall, was raised wide as a door.
When they looked inside the house, they found the bodies of three people about ten feet [3 m] inside, and they immediately notified the authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark trousers, no shoes; next to him lay another, wearing a white top.
Less than a meter away, the body of another person was found, wearing a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three of them were lying on their stomachs.
According to information received at the scene, the three people must have been murdered in another place, as no bullet casings were found.
Inscriptions on the wall of the country house, written by one organized criminal gang to another, and several puncture wounds in the wall and door were found.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (National Secretariat of Defence) identified 11 individuals, including a minor, who were part of a criminal gang active mainly in the village of Cadereyta, and who are associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (hunter-hunting) and clandestine burials.
According to the information made public, eight people were arrested and one prisoner released on 11 November in the settlement of Los Alveros.
Three properties and a mobile phone were seized, and the detainees were confirmed to be members of the criminal group Los Zetas.
At 0600 on November 12th, military officers on their watch in the town of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta found a car with no number plates and two people inside.
When the military inspected the car, they found a long gun, a magazine and 18 rounds.
Later, on November 13th, at 2 pm, one of their accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape when the military saw him.
They are accused of secret burials in the towns of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government is to be formed on Wednesday
The newly appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the Italian President to introduce him to the new government that is to face the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government which will face the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with the president of the state, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet made up mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present the President with the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of a government.
"I want to reiterate my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times", the former EU Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The frame is well set", he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy is struggling with a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a hard-line austerity package demanded by European politicians to restore the shattered confidence in Italy.
The pressure to act quickly on Monti was further heightened by the volatile market situation which resulted in Italian government bonds being charged at 7% for 10 years, the same rate at which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for European bailouts.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian Confindustria industry association, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government with all our strength".
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
The chances of success for Montis were greatly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which was forced to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to bring good results", said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because many of its members have so far spoken out against a government made up of a majority of technocrats, which Monti is forming.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts or the delay in reforms could again cause a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also putting pressure on the Commission by stating that a failure by Montis would be a disaster.
Mr Monti began his debate on Monday with political parties, trade unions and employers' associations, as well as youth and women's organisations.
The session is to be closed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has set in motion an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week when it was announced that Berlusconi would step down, the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister has caused the cost of Italian government bonds to reach critical levels again.
A bailout of Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said his government must last until the next elections, expected in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms instead of pushing elections forward.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist it should be made up of only technicians, a sign of their concerns in the face of the process imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources indicate that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the inclusion of people from the political sphere.
Spaniards have more opportunities to play than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called up from Spain, 10 have over 50 international matches to their name.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 drafted has played 50 games.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when comparing the 22 players from both countries who are in the lineup for the friendly match, which will take place at 3:05 p.m. today at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly rankings, can look back on a considerable number of selection matches in the A-Class, the tri-colour team only has the defender Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international matches.
This was achieved last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players, who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential clubs in the Premier League of England, have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (league and cup championships) and high-level European cups such as the Champions League each year.
In addition, the experience of the Spanish Fury in the complicated qualifying matches for the Euro Cup and the World Cup.
Tico players, on the other hand, have few international matches in Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its final score: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who on Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 away games, equalised with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play the tricolor today and Spain will set a new record of 127 away games.
Xavi Hernández, a player for FC Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke's center forward Raúl González with 102.
The number one hundred is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the Ticos side and close to Michael Umana are left-winger Júnior Díaz with 48 games and striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five players played more than 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least games.
The Spanish team has less than 30 games with Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national team, coming in at less than 30 games, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest of them aren't even close to the 20s.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
Spain's all-time goalkeeper is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.

"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam's bassist Jeff Ament says the band is ready to play one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
More than 20 years have been waiting for them, but the band assures that for them, playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This was confirmed by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva last week from Brazil.
The band is on the South American leg of their tour celebrating their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they'll make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium from 7:30 p.m. with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You are reading an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, playing Pearl Jam in Costa Rica is a dream come true: Do you realize what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is coming true for us too.
This is only the second time we've played in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once for a vacation. It's such a beautiful country that we'll probably stay there for a few more days.
It's exciting for us to get our music out there.
I'm asking you because the fans are so devoted to the band, they're experiencing the days leading up to the concert in the most intense way.
What do you say to your most ardent fans?
Thank you for being there for us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, and we thank you for the wait, and we're sorry it took us so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert is going to be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn't that put a little pressure on you from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've put on in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We've played some big shows in Sao Paulo and we're hoping that they've got us ready for this gig in Costa Rica.
We really want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing, and we love the jungle, and that's why Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
A lot of our friends are surfers, and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are just unimaginable.
My friends used to go to Costa Rica and Nicaragua to surf, and together with Mexico, they're great places to surf, and that's how we learned about it through people who love to surf.
With the tour coming up, you've put on some big shows with a lot of songs.
What are your plans for the Costa Rica event?
We've never played there, so we don't limit ourselves.
We're going to try to put on the best show possible with a lot of different songs, and we're going to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why? Why?
I think part of the reason is that we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs, and everyone likes a different song, so it's not easy to decide which one we're going to play.
Adding two or three songs to our repertoire that we have not played for a long time helps us to maintain our concentration and to surprise us by reminding us of the reasons why we liked those songs, otherwise they might be forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and I think it makes it more interesting for the audience.
This tour is to celebrate your 20 years of history.
Do you find it hard to believe in your success when you look back?
Yes, I totally did.
First of all, I don't think any of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years, and that sounds like a dream.
We're going to continue to build on that blessing and we're going to continue to love the fact that we're still making music together.
We love and are excited about making music.
We're lucky to be able to go to the places in the world that we've always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean to you to have actively participated in the birth of the Grunge?
It's always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We're good friends with the people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising and very unusual for a movement to emerge from a group of friends.
Every now and then, a band comes out of one city, but it's not unusual for five or ten groups to come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be a part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on tour and we're glad to still be friends with all of them and we're honored to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It's also very unusual for a band like yours to have stayed with the same musicians for so long.
Yeah, the four of us have been playing together for 21 years, and Matt joined us 13 years ago, which is a lot longer than most bands last.
First of all, I think we're all lucky to be alive and we care about each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up, which gives each individual the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other and each other's music, and we couldn't be better.
Your relationship with fame hasn't always been easy, but on the other hand, you've always been able to do whatever you wanted to do because of your success.
How do you find a balance?
The way we've grown up has made it easier for us to find balance.
We make sure we don't tour too much, because it's too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came for the music, it reminds you that you have to respect the music and what it brought into being, not obsess about being a famous rock star, which we never cared about anyway.
What are your memories of your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some really good songs, and at first it was great.
We were a band for three years, and until Andy (Andrew Woods) died, we had never released a record.
We were disappointed that it took us so long, and we're still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started the band with us, and when I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, and it was always a joy to go to work and laugh together and talk about music and football and many other things.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas are responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, Eddie Vedder in particular, and that's why you chose the band for the opening?
Yeah, the production team sent us videos of several bands and we liked this band the best so we're curious to see what Las Robertas can do live, which will be exciting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you're playing live?
That's a question for Ed, I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
Of so many
Some of the first people that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could spend the whole afternoon talking about the bass players I like.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge alive, even though it's no longer a fad?
I don't think we're all very familiar with the word grunge.
And when I think about it, I think of the bands that I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all the others that came out around the same time, and if they're still relevant today, I think that's great, because it's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are making better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, but now it's more positive.
Why is that?
And that's interesting, because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that might seem a little light-hearted, but there are other songs like "The End" or "Just Breathe" that are considered very dark songs, even though they have some positive things about them.
Both of them brought tears to my eyes when I heard Ed play them.
I think when you get older and something traumatic happens in your life, like losing a family member or a friend, it affects your artistic work and your music, and these two songs embody that very clearly for me.
But I also think that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.

Fujimori was taken to the hospital for further medical examinations .
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to examine the muscle loss in his legs, his family doctor said.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights abuses during his 1990-2000 rule, has several illnesses, including tongue cancer, which he has had four surgeries and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told the television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas hospital in Peru to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that he believes Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he did not want to do so because he believes Fujimori is innocent.
He has had four operations for cancer of the tongue, and he has lost 40 pounds (18 kg), as well as other conditions, such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been held in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía prison since September 2007 and has been detained in the prison since then.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the Peruvian army's death squad, which operated clandestinely during his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, consisting of several ministers and businessmen, will start its visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss regional policy issues.
Mujica will meet his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday, which, according to the Uruguayan president, will be the highlight of his busy schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón's support in the incident with France, when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries which still appeared as tax havens.
Mexico has held the presidency of the G20 since November, a group of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries, and since January this year it has had an agreement with the South American country on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to speed up the implementation of tax information exchange agreements in order to be removed from the OECD's "grey list" of countries that have not adopted all international standards for tax cooperation.
At the commercial level, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has existed since 2004, which has contributed to an increasing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The mustachioed installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which is coming to store counters around the world this month, was designed from the outset to match the features of the Nintende 3DS handheld console, which can be played in three dimensions without special glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to tell how the stereoscope works without glasses", assured Omar Álvarez, the person responsible for Nintendo's press in Spain, at the launch of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game from Nintendo that was designed from the ground up for this console", because until now, success stories like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman emphasized that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows for fast, fluid play.
Álvarez confirmed that Super Mario 3D Land contained two games in one: The first part is "easy" to capture the less-skilled users.
After that, the experts can "turn round" on the different levels of the game, which become increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the bottom of the action.
Super Mario's journey into the three-dimensional world also marks the character's return to a portable console, something that has not happened since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo is winking at the fans of the saga and repeating the recipe of success of the last issues: the moustached installer must overcome dangerous platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will encounter new movements, environments, disguises, and enemies - and a playable Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillos' extradition to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would extradite former Governor Alfonso Portillo to the United States to face charges for conspiring to launder $70 million.
The process of the US requesting Portillo's extradition to face trial in the US is over.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, considering that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that during his administration he had not interfered with court decisions and had granted all extradition requests that had come to his attention.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is being extradited for murder and aggravated assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The Colom procedure is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional instances for the conviction of the former president of the state (2000-2004) have been exhausted.
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzling 120 million quetzales from the Ministry of Defense during his government, a trial that preceded the extradition, but the Minister countered and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people facing social exclusion
The organisation was set up to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of Trinijove's existence have brought important results: in this quarter of a century, 6000 young people threatened with social exclusion have been helped to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, over 100 jobs have been created for this social group.
The anniversary was marked yesterday by an event attended by over 300 people at the former factory of Fabra i Coats.
Trinijove was set up in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems, who were at risk of marginalization.
The celebration in Sant Andreu yesterday was attended by many of the leaders of the institutions and organizations which have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different political tendencies in election campaigns testified to the impartiality of Trinijove's work.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the celebrations were attended by the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and then left-green city councillor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family Affairs, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of Social Work at Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that the times are no less complicated today, but added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a role model who knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the club and the work it does", he said.
Occupied house where huge parties were held has been cleared
The owners occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at 51 Balmes Street, Barcelona.
The 12 squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without resisting.
It seems that the nightmares of the neighbours of the house at 51 Balmes Street have come to an end.
Twelve people left voluntarily yesterday at noon the building they had illegally occupied and where they had organized huge parties that had driven the neighbourhood to despair, the eviction was carried out by judicial order without any police intervention.
After the evacuation, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled", confirmed the building manager.
The squatters who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply, painted the walls and left all kinds of trash, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The three lower floors were used for huge parties that lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had fallen by 80% since the occupation began.
The owner of the nightclub pointed out that the squatters were unfair competition, because they sold the drinks for three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the nightclub.
Moreover, the owner of the club had been denounced by neighbours for disturbing the peace, whereas according to her statement the noise was not caused by the visitors to the disco but by the occupants of the house and especially by the guests of the parties organized there, which, according to the angry neighbours, had been getting longer and longer in recent weeks.
The manager of the nightclub explained that the harassment was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building not to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (City Police) also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
Last week, the leader of the PP (Popular Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, called for the building to be evacuated immediately and for the problems of civic coexistence and the decline of the neighborhood to be addressed.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last few months, the squatters had broken into all floors of the building and almost all apartments, some even being robbed.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to intervene against the antisocial acts in the building".
Yesterday another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., police approached 35 rue Montral after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people trying to break into the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects have agreed to the tender, apart from the disputes over the fees.
The 16 Gates urban tender reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the latter published its libel against the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It has even been compared in numbers to New York's Central Park.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park was seen by many as the upper limit of Barcelona, as the Catalan capital is one of the few that does not extend north-south, but up (mountain) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
The model was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone, with the boars in the role of the Yogic bear.
This was achieved when the city issued a huge tender in September, comprising 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
No doubt a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that, or someone's planning to put gates on the land.
The question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
The call for tenders is the topic of discussion among all Barcelona architects, not only from an organisational point of view but also in terms of reflection on the city.
It's almost a recurring theme that two members of this long-established caste, who meet in the elevator, can fall back on.
And this very fact provides the material for one of the rare coincidences between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, it is "necessary" to speak of the "Front at the Mountain" after the attack on the coast, insofar as the speech of Ildefons Cerda, who spoke about the green apples, has not been delivered.
"We should assume that the beach is Barcelona's biggest park.
One of the reasons is that he is very accessible.
Collserola is more complex", says the architect, for whom the title "Collserola Gate" contains a "lexical trap": it must not be "conceived as access to a park, but as a limitation of areas where it is necessary to trade".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona, who have experience in urban planning, considers the proposal an "intellectual challenge" which "contains some dangers".
The European Council of Ministers for Education and Culture has adopted a resolution on the future of the European Schools, which calls for the development of a European school of education and training.
The first fear is the limitation of what can be built.
"To limit something always means to define the next step", i.e. to go beyond it.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current ones [the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster".
Modol, who is more closely concerned with the question, says that, in a simplified way, the side of Collserola which goes towards Vallesana "can be understood as a park which does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola which should not be "leaked out", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the mountain's proximity to the city is the cover letter that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" about whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams created ("just the right one", he says). "We architects should only be a tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex because the conditions of the tender do not give a global view of Collserola: "16 competitions were announced in the cross-section", he says, "on the mountain-sea axis, but there is no longitudinal perspective that considers the area as a whole".
In his case, at least, that's what got him into the 16 contests.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next door.
In his opinion, the city should ensure that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt is equipped throughout its length in such a way that a soft transition between the city and green zones is created.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazabal, who is released
After 72 days of silence, the casino's attorney, Red, acquits the mayor of Monterrey's brother of the lawsuit brought against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the Casino Red's representative has pardoned him before the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money so that the city government would approve the secret operation of the gambling house.
Following the criminal complaint, the prosecution opened a criminal case against the brother of the panist mayor, who was arrested on September 2nd for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the capital's Barrio Antiguo.
He remained there for 49 days after a second warrant, after the Public Ministry official had dismissed the charges of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison for allegedly bribing the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos, but he only stayed in the medium security prison for a few hours because of death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to attend the trial as an inmate of the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison.
On October 25, a warrant of arrest was served on him by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who found that after almost two months of investigations, there was sufficient evidence to convict Jonas of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bookmaker in order to open it in return.
This Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to issue the sentence, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, an official of the Ministerio Público assigned to the court, asked García Gómez if he had repaired the damage and which owner of the betting house had forgiven him, but the lawyer did not say his name.
In accordance with the case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted, and no objections to the trial can be filed, nor is compensation demanded.
After hearing the agent of the betting house at 3:50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court clerk, Jorge Yánez, drove to the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case would be put on the record.
He also informed him of the court order for his immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash that killed Secretary of State Francisco Blake and seven others.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat of Communications and Transportation in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation into the accident, in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people were killed, indicate that the helicopter, with its entire structure intact, crashed directly into the ground, without the pilot being able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before take-off that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing made contact with trees at 25 metres altitude, with the helicopter losing its fuselage, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts".
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, so it met all the requirements for transporting the personnel.
He also said that the search of the area where the plane had landed did not find any helicopter parts.
"The search did not find any aircraft parts in other places, the impact affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, so it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
The priority at present is to get the results as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, general director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), said that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidencial was flying at cruise speed when it hit the ground and that the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the belief that at the time of impact, this was a normal flight operation".
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, identified six relevant points to be taken into account in the inquiry:
Flight of the aircraft:
In accordance with the rules of the airline, this was a flight under the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew would have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded favorable weather conditions on takeoff, and during the flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, some low-hanging clouds were lifted.
Routes selected
It's possible that the crew chose a lower area with better visibility toward the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
Point of impact:
The impact coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter are in agreement, but it is possible that there was no loss of control or deviation from the flight path before the impact.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a restricted area:
The information available so far indicates that the helicopter was hit from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered debris suggests that the helicopter, with its structure intact, was struck by the ground.
No signs of fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane at the scene of the accident do not suggest fire or explosion.
The latest analysis indicates multiple contacts to the ground.
The site investigations found aircraft parts at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level, a terrain that is steep and has a gradient of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke down.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple ground contacts.
After a thorough search of an area beyond the restricted area at the crash site, no scattered aircraft parts were found, reinforcing the belief that the intact structure of the aircraft was impacted against the ground.
MSS announces research protocol to find the gene for obesity
The Social Security Institute of Mexico is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, called "Genetics of Childhood and Adolescent Obesity", which aims to find the genetic markers associated with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Medical Research Unit, focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team was set up, consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The public is invited to participate in the study, and those interested can come to the IMSS sports fields in the Valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out with children and young people every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation started at the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and since October 8 it has been continued at the sports ground of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México).
If the target of 500-600 subjects is reached, the study will be continued in the sports ground of Independencia (south of the capital district) and completed in that of Morelos (north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On World Diabetes Day, he said that he would try to get 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 to fill out questionnaires about their diet with their parents' consent and under their supervision.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of illness to check for risk factors that could lead to diabetes or kidney failure.
He also explained that on the Saturdays mentioned, the subjects were measured (weight, height, waist circumference), their blood pressure was checked and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors were determined (test to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this study was being carried out in response to the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight in young people.
"The health surveys conducted in 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years, the proportion of obese boys had increased by 77 percent and that of obese girls by 47 percent, and that obesity had also increased dramatically", stressed the IMSS specialist.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the people of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that on average, a Mexican is 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In a very general way, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess energy (calories) that we take in, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the study participants would be to have a comprehensive examination of the children to determine whether they were overweight or obese.
It would even look at the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and in the forearm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-diabetes.
All information would be kept confidential and the parents would be informed in writing by the doctors, who would explain all the test results to the parents and suggest lifestyle changes appropriate to prevent illness.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors that contribute to overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: lack of physical activity, spending most of the day watching television, and using transportation instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamala, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake, and the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the UNAM University of Mexico, develops polymer-modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs of the pavement were followed, it would not be necessary to repair the almost 200,000 impact holes that will be created when the rainy season begins in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (Mexico Valley Metropolitan Area), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the UNAM University, warning that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt pavement were done properly, the number of impact holes would be greatly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his talk "Blowholes from a Technical Point of View", given on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he runs is developing polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture similar to asphalt but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the road surface and thus avoid the occurrence of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of petroleum, is a hydrocarbon compound, one part of which has a high molecular weight called asphaltene, and the other part has a low molecular weight called malthene, and together they give the road surface its characteristic elastic behavior.
The coelastis­tic behaviour of asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of nearly 180°C, at 120°C it is very viscous and at 50°C it is almost solid, while at very low temperatures it becomes brittle.
"This means that the strength of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes from one day to the next depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations", explained the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City have a majority of a flexible pavement composed of six layers of material, the last three of which include asphalt.
Between the uppermost layers is a layer of asphalt, which is made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single pebble of this wear layer has been bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows for good force distribution in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed", said the chemical engineer.
"Above the wear layer", he explained, "is a final layer, called the 'tread layer', which is made up of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which has also been bathed in asphalt.
As these layers are in contact with the vehicle tyres, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and must produce friction.
The road surface receives and distributes the most forces, the tread layer also needs a suitable thickness and the material of which it is made must be maintained.
Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially water", he said, "as it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the ground becomes damp, water enters the layer and is difficult to get out again, causing all the layers of the road surface to soften and, as a result, to create potholes.
"When a hole is created", he said, "the first layer of the roof is removed, and the wear layer is only later affected, but the damage is not immediate, but a process that should be maintained at the first sign through appropriate maintenance programmes".
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) explained that vehicle load is another important cause of potholes, so that the thickness of each layer of road surface must always be in proportion to vehicle load and that it must be ensured that this rule is respected to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and which allow the repair of potholes to be carried out easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What was the candidate del Valle missing to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to win the Miss Colombia crown.
El Valle wins his 14th mixed title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca was eliminated in the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with standing on the podium, displaying a silver crown and the ribbon that she wears as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained that night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the Departamento already has 14 Miss titles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown in their hands. Among the Misses proclaimed are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Al Garcés (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés (2008).
The big question many people ask today is, What was missing?
For the result is the downfall of a great favorite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not for nothing she had been chosen the Queen of the Police and the Major Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles also received by the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who took home the Miss Colombia crown.
The first factor that was considered decisive for the jury's decision to appoint her as the First Miss was that she had not been convinced by the answer to the question "What book has influenced you the most and why?", which was put to her by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe quite a lot in literature, I think it's a way of civilizing oneself, and I think the book that had the most impact on my childhood, 'The Little Prince', is a very profound book.
I'm currently reading Guilt and Atonement, a book of universal culture that we should all read, and I'm reading a book by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian woman, a beautiful book called Passions.
This was a response which was not well received, firstly because of the term 'civilising' and secondly because it had not explicitly explained how each of the books it mentioned had affected it.
But after the ceremony was over, Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what it's meant to happen.
And for everyone, please read The Little Prince, it's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the favorite, who received all the applause and who had received all the prizes in advance (gastronomy competition Oster, audience vote on the best hand-tailored costume and Reina Madre), "made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the Queen, who therefore could not shine on the stage".
And you could see that in her first performance in a bathing suit on the beach at the Hilton Hotel and in her two elevators at the coronation.
Although she performed well in both, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on the RCN program Como en casa, said that Melina's being crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition doesn't become queen after all".
Besides, Valle avoided the press at the end - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
It must have been for some reason that two days before the international jury was assembled, Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social sense, that she had already worked on projects before entering the competition", she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her derriere defects and fibrosis, which was noted in her stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good diet and responsible physical work.
The queen's coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem with the fibrosis in her abdomen, which was hardly noticeable to me to be honest, pushed her score on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the fault of the Valle del Cauca woman was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"The surgeries are all right, but Valle didn't know how to do them properly.
Her body was never her strong point, and that part had to pay".
Because of this prize, which is the first to be awarded by the National Beauty Contest, a cruel prediction was made after the swimsuit performance, which was to come true in the night.
Whether or not that's true, the fact is that Melina is entering her year of reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that will allow her to represent Colombia in one of the international beauty pageant contests, upon nomination by the National Beauty Pageant.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, missed the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A scannerman from Cali went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4th, a Lophoscopist from the CTI (Cali Prosecutor's Office) was identified as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) - "Alfonso Cano" by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscope operators in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González, a Puerto Tejada man who has been working in criminal investigations for 21 years, was on call.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the communities of Chocó, where he often had to travel for five days in the jungle to reach the location of the bodies he was to identify.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the required courses he specialised in Lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is subject to friction, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
In the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was instructed to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
He flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca on Friday night.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of them might be that of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he had to take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived at the location of the body with the examiner, he could not identify him because his physical appearance was not at all similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, dressed like a local farmer, wore no glasses, and was much thinner.
But fingerprints are not a lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planting cell, and a flashlight, Eleazar compared the corpse's fingerprints with those on the printed page.
He had seen right, it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was indeed the head of the FARC.
Searching for Traces
For a dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of the "Cano" was very important.
A lot of people don't know what we do.
The science of dactyloscopy is an exact science with no margin of error, which can be a key factor in solving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also assist in homicide and robbery investigations and confirm the identity of arrested individuals.
When arrested, many criminals present false identification documents or do not have any.
We'll take their fingerprints and run them through the database.
The researcher told us that during a burglary, he had to tear a piece of wall from a house because the thief had put his hand on this very spot when he was taking out a safe that was stuffed with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to take the entire handprint and identify the criminal who had participated in several thefts", he recalled.
Fingerprints can also be used to exonerate or incriminate murder suspects.
A body was recently found surrounded by liquor bottles.
The investigation suspected that a family member might be a suspect, and indeed, a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI fingerprint technician explained that "fingerprints are taken from the object with chemical or physical reagents".
If they appear, a plant cell or a conveyor belt is used.
After that, the prints are sent to ASIF, which is the criminal database, or to the registrar.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identity papers", explained the CTI expert.
He said that not everything was as portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as all that glitters is not gold, all that you touch is not a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a proper comparison.
The "indignant" are challenging the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded together in tents in Zuccotti Square.
Most of them complied with the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday as they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square with a court order after being evicted at dawn and attempted to occupy another space at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they were seeking to gain access to a court order allowing the "indignants" to re-set up their tents, while another part of the movement held to the evacuation order and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine arrests were made.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations", said Mark Bray, one of the spokesmen of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray explained that the "indignant" response to the eviction of their tent camp, which was ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, did not go to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order forbidding the forced eviction of the site and allowing the protesters to camp.
The Enraged also occupied a new park at the intersection of downtown Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray cannot give exact numbers, he assured Efe news agency that he also saw several journalists handcuffed.
The organization said hundreds of people had gathered at the site, where a delegation of religious leaders had arrived to show their support for the members of the movement and to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square (a private property) remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, which will analyze the legality of the early morning eviction.
Some of the protesters who were driven from the square carried photocopies of the court order and distributed them, even giving them to some of the policemen guarding the square, which resulted in "some small clashes", as Bray reported, indicating that some policemen had beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street from the square, and from applying "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had used before".
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that the court ordered the closure of the square to public traffic and protesters, and the protesters pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to set up tents and sleeping bags in the square.
The mayor personally defended the early morning evacuation of Zuccotti Square, which saw almost 200 people arrested, and which was decided because the protesters "were breaking the law".
Bloomberg said he ordered the evacuation because the square had "turned into a place where people came not to protest but to break the law and in some cases to harm other people", because "some businesses had received threats" and residents feared "for their quality of life".
"The early morning eviction was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests and not protecting the interests of North American workers", added the movement's spokesman, who accused the mayor of "not respecting press freedom".
The leaders of Occupy Wall Street said they were considering organizing "large actions" for Thursday, along with community organizations and labor unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been going on since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is on the Christmas show The Virgin Mary
She will be joining Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on the December 1st TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas".
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant on Home Improvement, a lifeguard on Baywatch, a Playboy bunny, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model who will be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian TV Christmas special.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with crooner Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st, bringing a very special Virgin Mary to life.
CTV today released footage of the television program in which Anderson - who also appeared in a self-made pornographic film for Internet distribution, in which she appears with her ex-husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as the Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap, which is supposed to represent Jesus.
The scene features Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently hosted Charlie Sheen's My Violent Torpedo of Truth as the Christ Child.
The CTV Christmas programme not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentinian model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at a concert in New York, Bublé called the North American star Kim Kardashian a "whore".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the free-fall spiral from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that triggered a nuclear crisis and the worst disaster Japan has seen since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government put the damage at $300,000, a blow that seems to be fading despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of decline, the data on gross domestic product from July to September finally closed this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and by 6% at the rate calculated for the year.
The second quarter figure - in Japan, the financial year starts in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth since the January-March 2010 period.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, firms increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline in capital investment recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable growth.
However, the real upturn in the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian impulses to use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan's recovery is mainly due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by the growth of expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refugee currencies" of investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the gloomy forecasts for the US, a privilege that weighs like a tombstone on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the big technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the yen's quotation.
While markets continue to be concentrated in the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains vigilant.
"One must be alert to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen", said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
The prospects are not very promising.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most member states had shown clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the greatest economic powers would have been slowing down.
Because it dropped by four tenths to a whopping 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average of 100 after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens is raising doubts again
Papadimos says the austerity measures will be passed, but the Conservatives won't sign a written agreement
With the risk premia of the peripheral countries soaring and the uncertainty spreading, Greece is also continuing to lose itself in the maze that emerges from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more a reaction to pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly being confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there are no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the 100 days agreed upon upon his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative Nueva Democracia party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he supports the new austerity measures and will not in any way withdraw his call for new elections on the scheduled date of February 19.
The European Parliament has adopted a resolution calling on the Commission to take action to combat the illegal trade in arms and the illegal trade in arms.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures to combat tax evasion are the first initiatives.
However, Samara's statement does not remove the doubt about his position: "We are committed to supporting the transitional government, but nothing else".
The conservative leader went a step too far in challenging the EU and the IMF, the body that Athens desperately needs to unlock the $8 billion, and made it clear that he would not accept a commitment to meet the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the repercussions of the Papandreou-poker-game referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand should not be wavered: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties did not sign "a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is required for the payment of the sixth installment" of €8 billion, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek Knuel has some strings left.
Queen Sofía: "These are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "dominant" position of Spain in this type of financing.
Spain "has achieved a dominant position in the role of microfinance in the world".
Queen Sofía of Spain yesterday recalled that in the last two decades Spain has become the second largest donor to this instrument of international cooperation, whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity based on trust in people".
The Queen inaugurated the Fifth World Summit on Microfinance in Valladolid yesterday, saying that there was "no doubt" that this type of business was "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and "in particular, the target of reducing the number of people living on less than a dollar a day, below the poverty line".
"Spain continues to work" on extending the network of beneficiaries "to the far corners of the world and it is carrying out this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will come out of the summit, which lasts until Thursday, will guarantee "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have achieved many successes" and "we face many challenges".
The Micro-credit Summit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen said that the aim is to have 175 million poor families accessing these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households will be above the poverty line.
The concept of microfinance in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the path "initiated by Muhammad Yunus years ago", which Queen Sofia judges to be an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financing instrument as an "admirable idealist, committed to fighting poverty" and whose work she had known for 15 years when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999 and Canada in 2006, all of which "have seen continuous progress", said the Queen, whose commitment to the project earned her yesterday the appraisal as "head of the family" in Valladolid and "spokesperson for the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging the audience to engage in the debate and to seek solutions to poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid during economic booms,because it is a 'lasting commitment'.
Jiménez said that microfinance was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty" and that the governments of the industrialized countries should now work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to be sacrificed to the crisis.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the 'most important forms of development aid'.
Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded the "success" of giving "hope" to "marginalized" people "who always face closed doors", and Valladolid Mayor Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed the audience in a city that "opens its doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress in Leipzig on Monday 14 November was without any real difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally on the programme but was pushed through in the autumn, particularly to satisfy those activists who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow to be too lax.
The proposal for a European Commission presidency, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted for several minutes and was given first to Angela Merkel and then to Wolfgang Schäuble a few hours later, did not leave any doubt in the minds of the three Europe-minded finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea - as well as the petition - is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is 'not less, but more Europe'.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because 'nine million jobs depend directly on the euro'.
The Chancellor said that 'the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe'.
This could be expressed in a modification of the Lisbon Treaty, which would strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the countries in the eurozone, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage, "to give Europe a face".
But this is definitely one of the proposals that was passed by Congress, and it was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble's idea.
It is unlikely that the 47 will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is opposed to it, and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
The milestone has been reached.
The delegates also overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to give each country a weighting on the ECB's Executive Board in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously strengthen Germany's position.
The Chancellor, who was concerned with reassuring the climate within her party, therefore strengthened the points of reference for Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
The European Parliament's proposal devotes a paragraph to the importance of the 'French-German friendship', but Angela Merkel does not call for France to be on the agenda.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that Leipzig was the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the sick-reporting fraud represent?
After the family allowance, UMP and the government are now tackling sickness reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15th, to visit a family aid fund and to give a speech on the theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, a recurring theme since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to put the economy through a tough test, but on the other hand is no less a harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee sickness reports.
First, with budgetary objectives: the government envisages the introduction of a fourth day of sick leave before taking into account a sickness report for workers in the private sector.
In German, this means that a worker who is sick would lose four days' pay, or at least 15% of his monthly income, without the specific company's consent.
The Commission has already taken action to ensure that the EU's financial instruments are used to the full.
The Commission has also proposed to the Council to grant a derogation to the French Government, which would be accompanied by another measure of a more symbolic nature: granting unpaid leave to public servants in the event of illness (there is no time limit for them, unlike the three days' leave in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority are also re-launching the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with absenteeism.
"Controls will be much more important, and moreover, they will be returned if requested", warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November, on the microphone of RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this notification seems somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of sickness notifications.
In fact, it has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, and these have most often borne fruit.
The French are not sick more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
But first let us dwell on the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million in daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics and Documentation, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008 at EUR 11.3 billion.
This amount was 46% for maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% for sick leave, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
And then 2.5% of health care.
In 2010, the French were granted an average of only 14.5 sick days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
A median that obscures certain differences: another, published in 2007 by career planning website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time from the health insurance, shows that 37% of the sickness reports in 2010 were of less than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% more.
Compared with their European neighbours, French workers are therefore not more likely to be unable to work than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global rate of absenteeism (due to illness or other reasons) fluctuated between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sickness registers is a tiny fraction of the black market.
The level of fraud is only slightly high.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has meant that there are systematic checks on sick leave exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public institution for the training and further education of technicians and engineers) found that, among 1.5 million checks, 13% of the 285,000 short-term sick leave notices, i.e. 37,050 cases, were 'unjustified or too long'.
Among the systematically monitored cases of sickness reports lasting more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million cases were 'unadjusted or unjustified', i.e. 132,000 cases.
In total, this means that there are 169 000 cases of "unjustified" sick leave for millions of workers.
The figures are only a weak comparison with, for example, the figure for black labour.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of lost tax revenue per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus substantially more than the fraud in the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should be able to adopt a decision on the new financial framework for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1999.
The European Parliament has already expressed its concern at the situation in the country, and has called for the immediate release of all political prisoners.
"To continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme", the Prime Minister said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the 27 October Eurogroup was the 'main task' of the new government, he added, as the country's participation in the eurozone was 'at stake'.
Accordingly, Mr Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit by '9%' of GDP by the end of the year, after it stood at 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new austerity measures
The right-wing leader, Antonis Samaras, had on Monday given his approval to the measures already approved in an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but had said that his party would not be prepared to take additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of any new measures", he said at a meeting of his New Democracy party's deputies.
It had committed itself to reducing budget deficits and debt, and to combating waste, but it was hostile to any policy that would stop the recovery.
Olli Rehn, the EU Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of €8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the proposed measures, had replied to Antonio Samaras that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under pressure from the outside.
The European Parliament has voted to reject the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to chemical agents.
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel said that governments, health care institutions and doctors were working together on pain relief to provide the best pain relief, and that this was going beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually commit to talking to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and making arrangements for that purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of a powerful report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts linked together in various fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
This panel recommends that the government amend the penal code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia where this choice is made, and that is in patients who are considered capable of making such a choice.
As a starting point, the experts cite a recent survey by the independent EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that "medical euthanasia in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to discuss death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to pain medication, say experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians wanting to die at home, 68.6% of Canadians end up dying in hospitals.
In the whole country, Quebec has the highest rate of deaths in hospitals at 86%.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reach conclusions which are contrary to the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not want to make any changes to the penal code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
But now, according to the experts who have inspected all those countries whose approaches have legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and assisted suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would result in abuses in their practice, i.e. the practice of performing euthanasia or assisted suicide by incompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, there are far more cases of such violations in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, a co-signatory of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Also, assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Let's remember that according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll, 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia, because they believe it allows people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing euthanasia does not convey the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
For those who have already committed assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear for patients who are maintaining or discontinuing medication, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their recommendation that the criminal law should specify that the disposal of the means for which a valid refusal has been made should not be considered as criminal.
The panel also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained to respect end-of-life drug withdrawal without fear of criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health-care institutions, and doctors were working together on pain relief to provide the best pain relief available, even beyond cancer cases.
Finally, the Panel calls for the use of pain-reducing or life-terminating measures already widely used in Canadian health care institutions to be at least considered, since they serve no more than euthanasia to reduce physical pain and they refer to the same procedures.
Other experts' reservations
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
The report also calls for the adoption of a new approach to the problem of euthanasia, which is based on the principle of 'the patient is not responsible for his own death'.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 years old can ask someone else to help him commit suicide", said RA Deschamps, who had seen a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's own responsibility above all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But, he says, there are 'guidelines and obligations in a society'.
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, also voiced'strong opposition' to the report's conclusions, which she labelled as a 'pro-euthanasia manifesto'.
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly doubts reports of the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to step down
The EU is a party to the Paris Agreement.
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is countering it with the help of Russia and is claiming to be plotting against the country, intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League's exclusion of Syria, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, despite the fact that Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbours, have taken a position in favour of President Assad's departure.
The President of the Council, Mr Pisani, said that the European Union was prepared to take action in the event of a crisis in the Middle East, and that the European Union was prepared to take action in the event of a crisis in the Middle East.
"If Bashar cares about his country's interests, he would step down, but he should also create the conditions for a new era of Syrian political life", the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, had complained that the Turkish mediation efforts made with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
The European Union is also calling for the immediate release of all those who have been detained in the country, and for the immediate release of all those who have been arrested.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the 'strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime' as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have raised an increasingly sharp tone in the face of repression in Syria", observes Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government forces have been killed in the Dar'a region in southern Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Two more civilians were killed in "shooting and heavy bombing around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless said that the country was "moving towards the end of the crisis".
The EU's position on the Middle East is that the situation in the Middle East is worsening, and that the EU should be able to take action to help the people of the region.
The EU is also committed to the development of a more effective and more effective EU-wide approach to the fight against terrorism.
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now examining a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wants 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, media and military observers to be sent to the country.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé, had also spoken in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from repression by the regime, which is mired in its'paranoia'.
An unscheduled new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis management plan agreed on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from besieged cities and the release of detained protesters.
The Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described the decision of the Arab League as "incorrect" yesterday, to avoid advocating possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already warned Syria to implement the plan to end the crisis.
Italy
Monti calls for patience from the markets and for Italy to make sacrifices
Mario Monti, the future Italian prime minister, has asked the markets for a little more time to form his staff and to implement a programme that will 'sacrifice' to regain the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner held a negotiation with the political parties before the meeting of the trade unions and employers' organisations today.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in Parliament, composed relatively strictly of outside technocrats.
'Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims', said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the President-in-Office.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, had said he expected Mario Monti to give Parliament a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by Mr Monti of a list of cancellations, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness in the stock and bond markets had taken its toll.
In a democracy, there are certain deadlines for preparing a government and a government programme, he stressed, noting that 'markets are bound to be cautious and understanding'.
The President's appointment was initially welcomed by the markets, but unrest had since intensified, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro zone in September.
The incumbent Prime Minister was asked to set up a staff of mainly technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include 'politicians'.
The new government should only last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
The new government should receive the Parliament's vote of confidence by Friday, according to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies.
Mr Monti has, since taking up his post, pledged to work with all the urgency of the day to make Italy a 'new protagonist' in Europe.
A spokesman for the EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that 'our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change even with the new government in mind'.
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of balancing the budget in 2013 despite the austerity measures adopted in recent months, has in particular requested new austerity measures.
The Commission's proposal is to be submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council, and the Council will be consulted on the proposal.
Mr Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a 'change of era' in Italy after 17 years of 'Berlusconism'; the 'Professor' symbolises the 'trustworthiness challenge' and a 'different Italy', say the lead authors.
The big unknown is the longevity of its staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy has to pay for 200 billion euros of government bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iran's nuclear energy program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a nuclear-capable explosive, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risk confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS based its findings on the recently published report of the International Atomic Energy Agency and other documents issued by this UN agency to investigate this scientist.
The IAEA last week expressed its'serious concern' at a 'possible military dimension' of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to the detailed study of the IAEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked for over three decades, since the early 1960s, in a Soviet military nuclear facility in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds created by blasting.
In 1989 or 1991, he is said to have left the centre to set up a company in Kiev producing 'nano-diamonds'.
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He was also involved in the 'Crimean Tatar' regime.
In its last report, the IAEA cited 'strong evidence that the Iranian development' of a nuclear explosive device system 'has been assisted by the work of a foreign expert who is not only highly skilled in this technology but who has also, as one member state of the Agency has indicated, worked on this technology throughout his career, essentially directly in his country's military nuclear energy programme.'
Anti-Islamic crimes and offenses have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes either decreased slightly or increased only slightly during the same period, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to the data, the total number of violent crimes against Muslims rose by 49% from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, while there was a 13% increase in crimes against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews, and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes globally.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% for racial and 20% for religious crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a decrease in 2009, it is alarming to see these crimes and crimes on the rise again", stressed the human rights organization Human Rights First. "The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant", the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long emphasised that violence against Muslims, like all forms of hate crime, should be considered a serious human rights violation", added Paul Legendre, an official of the organisation.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks", he added, suggesting that this could be done by improving policing attitudes towards 'hate crimes'.
The "hate crime" in American federal law is a legacy of the civil rights era.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence directed against race, color, religion or descent and now also includes crimes of sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing the platform and becoming more like Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter introduced changes to its platform presentation on Monday to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activities of those who follow their posts, making the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new 'Activity' tab and a new 'Name' feature will make it easier to read and follow the live activities of other 'Twitterers', the Internet users whose tweets you follow and who follow your tweets.
This allows you to find out if they allow you to follow their news, if they subscribe to new posts, if they favour certain news, etc.
The new Twitter menu was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before it went live on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter was known for its uninstinctive functioning, with a text that seemed esoteric (RT for the referenced repetition of another person's contribution).
The network's users debated this innovation via certain 'tweets' on the Internet.
"It's useless, intrusive and too much like Facebook", writes @jemb123.
"The 'Activity' feature will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter stream", said @dannykronstrom.

The 'golden rule' of the budget is enshrined in the Constitution
The ruling Social Democratic/Christian Democratic government in Austria decided on Tuesday to incorporate a "Golden Budget Rule" into the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid any degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top credit rating (AAA).
It was the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann who personally announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, even though Austria's public debt is 74.6%, well above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had not dropped by one stroke from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an extra €3 billion in interest every year", argued Michael Spindelegger, the deputy chancellor and Christian Democrat foreign minister.
Austria also responds to a request made by the Brussels summit of euro-area member states on 26 October: the heads of state and government had demanded the introduction of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to public balance in the constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government is similar to the 'German model', as Germany was the first European country to incorporate such a 'rule' into its constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 onwards the structural budget deficit of the federal state should not exceed the 0.35% of GDP threshold, while the regional states and municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eliminate budget debt below the 60% threshold set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.

Noda threatens to intervene in the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene in the currency markets again if the yen continued to rise.
"If we find excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, "we will intervene as we did last time", Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was again close to the historical levels which forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo had sold yen for dollars in a massive way to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which is about to set a new record since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has steadily risen above this, supported by purchases by investors who see the yen as a 'refuge' in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and European debt crisis.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped below the symbolic 105 yen bar to near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth about 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of Japanese currency is damaging to the archipelago's exports, as it increases the cost of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the value of income earned by Japanese firms from abroad, as they convert it into domestic currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild after the earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast) on 11 March", said Mr Noda, who feared that the rise in the yen could kill the weak recovery in its infancy.
The third largest economy in the world, with growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared with the previous quarter - has gained momentum for the first time this year, thanks to the rapid growth of exports and the consumption of households "clogged" by the catastrophe.
The Prime Minister, however, believes that the yen's rise does not reflect "Japan's economic fundamentals".
The Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, was urged by Finance Minister Jun Azumi to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, said that the Bank of Japan had already taken "appropriate measures", indicating that no further monetary easing was expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the central bank increased its purchases of government bonds by 5 trillion yen (EUR 47 billion) to cover the 55,000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) of collateral it had spent on various purchases of financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
The euro area:
Interest rates soar, stock markets are backing down
The contagion risk of the debt crisis is constantly undermining European key figures.
Despite the new heads of government in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weaker countries are steadily rising.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are drifting a little more in the negative direction on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC lost 1.4 percent and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
"Due to new tensions over sovereign bond yields in the troubled eurozone, global equity markets are continuing to release some of their recent gains.
"Investors are nervous and only too aware of the risk of contagion", said Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which is suffering from the renewed fear of market participants regarding capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, closed with a loss of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and trading is moving along a limited corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation has stabilized", said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency, which continues its downward trend on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 o'clock the European currency was worth $1.3570, so it was down 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it fell after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, which met in Congress on Monday, accepted a proposal which, in particular, envisages the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% threshold.
The interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain are still at very worrying levels.
This morning the yield on Italian bonds of 10 years was 6.85%, while that of Spanish bonds was 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, as well as in France, continue to feed investors' fears.
The future Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, demanded more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, which was threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was 'the main task' of his government.
Spain is in the eye of the markets as parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread between German and Spanish 10-year bonds has reached a new historic high.
Expecting growth in the euro area
Statistically, France recorded household consumption-driven economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the decline in the second quarter figures to a loss of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it's the fourth quarter that economists are most concerned about.
Germany, for its part, grew by 0.5% over the same period.
A first upswing of the eurozone as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts Should Prevail over Dogma
If there is one subject which cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, it is certainly energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of firms.
It is reasonable to hold an election meeting to reflect on this subject and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it examines the full range of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are seven billion people on this planet, and demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world's population should not be deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, we must alleviate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity on a sustainable basis, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a subject that has disappeared from the environmental debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Germany therefore remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case in Belgium, which has made its decision based on the need to find a substitute source, or in Switzerland, which is currently planning to build only the latest generation of nuclear power stations.
The UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few, are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, decided to add another unit to its Fukushima plant by reopening the Three Mile Island plant, which had been closed down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, focused on renewable energy sources, is sometimes held up as a model, the reality is contrary to the discourse.
The Berlin vote will have an impact on the price of electricity, on energy dependence, in particular on Russia, due to the increased use of imported gas, and on the increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal power stations.
The sum total of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark is a sobering one.
Denmark is the European leader in wind energy, which provides 30% of its electricity, and one of the largest users of coal and gas, alternating with wind energy, which result in CO2 emissions and electricity prices that are 65% and 50% higher than the European average, respectively.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals in the past, and I am sure that the Commission will make them in the near future.
Since the price of energy is a key factor in the competitiveness of the global economy and a guarantee of stability for industry on a national basis, French companies have an advantage in having the cheapest electricity in Europe.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and Parliament, and I am sure that the Council will be able to support them.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are not prepared to pay, nor are they opposed to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industrial sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
The strong export character of the Community means that it brings a large number of specialised small and mediumsized enterprises to international markets and makes them creators of many jobs.
If France were to decide to phase out nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual €6 billion in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to last for sixty years if the downfall of his manufacturer was pre-programmed?
To solve the energy equation, you have to accept that there is no magic bullet for generating electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by the Areva company for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are a testament to the complementarity of energy sources.
The highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France we have a safety authority which carries out uncompromising and transparent checks on existing plants, such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their teams, which have made a name for themselves by their professionalism, are obsessed with the idea of safety.
In the space of 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major failures.
Only one, at Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, and thus without consequences for humans or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the tragedy was caused by the construction of the reactor and by an innocent human failure.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented proportions, which caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident as it did from the previous two.
The EPR is the result of this approach and of cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German nuclear power plant operators and designers. It is a design that will make it resistant to such phenomena.
The Commission's proposal is to make a further contribution to the development of nuclear energy in the Community by providing for the development of a nuclear power station in the Community, which will be the subject of a joint study by the European Commission and the European Atomic Energy Community.
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and partisans dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overloading of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "land of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students by the authorities had been the subject of a weekly show, with the Minister of the Interior declaring incidentally (see Libération of 23 May) that France "did not need any foreign talents, masons or waiters".
But this policy has rarely been analyzed from an economic point of view.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are used in a proper way.
On the right, Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that '900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrants, should not be a problem for a country', was struck by the tone of the left, and on the left, Michel Rocard, who had said in 1990 that France 'could not absorb all the poverty in the world'.
The only difference is the degree of grossness.
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both the right and the left in 2005.
Both camps perceived immigrants as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity which one is willing to show towards immigrants.
Francois Hollande is confining his programme to trivia, which suggest that partnership development will allow us to solve our 'migration problems'.
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the latest immigration knowledge (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of the influx of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
Restricting immigration would weaken growth and damage the labour market.
The fear of the influence of migrants is based on the idea that they threaten to replace native workers, especially the less qualified, by putting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in reality much more complementary to native workers, since they are mainly engaged in occupations in sectors which are not technically occupied.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors which are unattractive to local wage-earners, the more skilled immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not commensurate with the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, this complementarity between natives and migrants also has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the immigration tide will lead to a related long-term increase in real wages of between 0.6% and 0.9%.
This is in spite of the fact that the diversity of ideas brought by immigrants is beneficial to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make a net contribution to social systems, in the European countries, on average about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 will contribute on average a net (revenue minus expenditure) of around €150,000 to the public budget over his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to make the missing intersections "with his teeth" at the beginning of his mandate.
These teeth, which were supposed to deter immigrants, did the exact opposite.
Europe has invented democracy, now it is time to rethink European democracy
Democracy is a precious commodity; it is also a fragile commodity.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had to endure the whole of the 20th century through the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some people may have thought that it was enough to exercise the right to vote in the most direct way possible to see democracy defeated once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon "the Little" that it was a characteristic of the state of mind.
The universal suffrage, which is a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition for it and can become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
The Commission has not yet taken a decision on the question of the future of the Community, but it is still too late to take a decision on the future of the Community.
The crisis in Europe that we are in is an economic crisis, but it is also, and above all, a political and democratic crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek referendum on truth or falsity would have been doubly revealing in this respect: on the one hand, the need for a vigorous return to politics, but on the other hand, also the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by pressing for the success of the internal referendum, organized according to necessity and in the wrong order.
A free-for-all for the European monarch or a blindfolded leap into the void of nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want a collective task, based on full rights, clarification and consistency, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - and we do not know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is all of Europe that is bowing to the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, which are suffering from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is all of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
The European Community is not a mere institution, it is a political institution, and it is not a political body.
The urgency is to hand back the leadership of the European project to the people's sovereignty.
The European Union must be able to reduce its debt burden, free itself from the markets and build a future through investment.
The European Union must be able to take action to bring about a change in the situation in the region, and we must be prepared to take action to bring about a change in the situation in the region.
After being opposed for a long time by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, this proposal is now being pushed by everyone in the European economic leadership.
I'm with you.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it is proposing to the citizens - would be another folly and another dead end.
We must embark on a new phase of European construction.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction remains in force.
We must build a Europe which is more integrated on the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more democratic Europe politically, a truly European sovereignty of the peoples.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
Contactless smart cards become commonplace
The World Chip Card Fair opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris with optimism.
Eurosmart said 2011 should have ended with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards, phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most promising segment is contactless technology, which allows payments to be made in public transport or to make purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless cards will be sold worldwide, compared with 320 million a year earlier!
Their market share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in contactless payments after a long time of lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards already have this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless cards were distributed.
However, consumer markets are in a state of flux.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCards this year.
In order to move to a higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to provide their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out contactless chip bank cards to their customers in the future", announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first step towards the future of the mobile phone as a means of payment.
A very small percentage of devices are equipped with the NFC technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
"They're in arrears".
"But they should see a real upward trend at least next year".
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units worldwide in 2012", says Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE is running a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And yesterday, Société Générale also said it was preparing to launch a service that would allow its customers to pay contactless via mobile phones.
Terrorist front, of course, from the Sahara to Nigeria
The French authorities are concerned about the relations between Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspected links between the terrorist group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "achieved certainty" about the issue.
The Commission is therefore proposing to extend the scope of the directive to cover all the activities of the European Parliament and the Council, including the development of the internal market.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The Commission has also been asked to present a report on the implementation of the European Year of the Environment, which will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped by supporters of the AQMI in a restaurant in Niamey, were killed the following day at the same time as several of their captors in an operation carried out by French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators say they found several phone chips belonging to the terrorist in the rubble at the scene.
Terrorist axis
Analysis of the recorded telephone calls reveals several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria that is the birthplace of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt that more evidence needs to be produced before we can speak of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"It is conceivable, however".
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and intellectual support from Auβen and that it is becoming increasingly active", says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
The Commission's proposal to the Council and the European Parliament was to set up a European Union-wide network of information and communication networks, to be set up by the European Parliament and the Council, and to be implemented by the Member States.
The international community, starting with Washington, has been putting pressure on Abuja since then to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed long regarded the group as a community of Illuminati who need not be given special attention.
A quick success
The group, which was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf - which in Hausa means 'Western education is a disgrace' - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the merger is rapidly succeeding.
It is politicised and demands strict observance of Sharia law, while its affiliated activists are engaged in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists are targeting churches, bars and government offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active in their increased attacks on the commissariats.
The reaction from Abuja, however, is as usual indifferent.
The army is surrounding the city, 800 dead.
Captured Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming increasingly radical and is abandoning its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to a bombing in Jos that killed 80 people, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was blamed for a suicide bombing at the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local United Nations headquarters became the first international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to extend from Mauritania to Nigeria and Somalia, has since alarmed all security experts.
While the Aqmi have occupied Mali and Niger, the Somali have been operated by al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem appears to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, even Alain Juppé, in a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, warned against Boko Harem and said he was ready to "give all indications".
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival each other in simplicity and ignorance about China, Iraq and aiding Israel.
Can a crisis-ridden America lead a complex world with simple, not to say simplistic, ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate like that, voters might almost get that impression.
For several days now Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their cronies have been making their thunderous declarations and statements concerning foreign policy, a traditional Republican priority, repeatedly.
The European Parliament has been a very active participant in the debate on the question of the future of Europe.
The most popular candidate for the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", Mitt Romney, threatened to sue the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of "currency manipulation" - a leading issue in an America that is particularly irritated by the exodus of entire industries to Asia.
The Commission's proposal is to be submitted to the Council by 31 December.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost taken a breath away from his emotionally flattering gesture.
He had called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (as well as Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman is not being heard, because he's stagnating in the depths of the polls.
The image of Reagan
Romney had also vowed military action against Iran if the sanctions to halt its nuclear programme failed.
"If elected, I will stop Iran", he had said.
"If Obama is reelected, they'll get the bomb".
He also promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of failing to honour commitments to that partner.
The second-highest ranking candidate, businessman Herman Cain, has a shameful record of ignorance.
He recently called for countering the Chinese military threat as Beijing 'attempts to develop a nuclear power' - seeming to ignore the fact that China has had military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military action against Iran, has said he is willing to use the U.S. military against drug cartels in Mexico.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, which was outlawed by Obama in 2009, was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
It's a long way from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
The European Parliament has already been consulted on the Commission's proposal.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and had to put his money where his mouth is on the issue of counter-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive little talk with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also earned him a reputation for weakness.
This hostility is not entirely unprovoked.
The public is more likely to appreciate the positive national security record under Obama, which took out bin Laden.

Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and directly connects Western Europe with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is designed to supply gas to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with glitz and glamour.
The European Parliament has been asked to take a decision on the future of the gas pipeline, which is to be opened in the near future.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte symbolically turned the wheel of the valve that feeds Russian gas into the West European network.
The new gas pipeline is expected to deliver 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through a first pipeline of 1,224 km, connecting the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, which will allow a total delivery of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of France's total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012.
And the possibility of building a third line on the same route is already being mentioned.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this enormous structure is a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will allow direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any transit through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little bit of their power: it is now more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close off access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the most active in the debate, did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the Hitler-Stalin alliance for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically extremely sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
However, this came at the cost of weakening European energy, as the project has created a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has been able to achieve its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, which have a high consumption of gas and whose gas reserves are running low, in just five years.
'This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that links us in an organic way,' François Fillon said at the inauguration of the pipeline, pointing out the political and economic importance of the major gas contracts.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom managers, who are very much represented in Lubmin, in regard to the pipeline.
The construction of this pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel with a concrete sheath to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, about 200 meters deep.
The construction of the bridge had to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"About a hundred mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution", said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long metal snake, weighing 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted by anything along its length: neither valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned for the Swedish coast, but the project managers have refused to do so because the Swedes were not interested in seeing a Russian state company permanently settling on their shores.
"In the event of a breakdown, we will close the gas passage in less than a minute", Jens Müller said.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas transmission line escapes into the air.
This is considered by the designers to be unlikely, as the weld seam was estimated to have a leakage resistance of one per 100,000 years.
The state surveillance of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled from a seagoing vessel for external observation purposes and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It is shaped like a cigar, about a metre in diameter, is inserted into the inside of the pipeline and is moved by the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 metres per second, the device provides the most accurate information on arrival on any deformation of the metal.
The gas transmission line was designed to operate for fifty years without the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entry point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to make this project a reality.
However, the management of the company remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The German companies E.ON and BASF are also included (each 15.5%), as are the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (both 9%).
These five companies have formed a consortium called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company, on a renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the actual amount of gas transported is", said Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas transmission line was covered by 30% of the capital by the shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For example, GDF Suez's investment was 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are determined to recover their costs, since Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea on a sandy, pine-forested coastal strip near Lubmin.
The 15 feet (4.5 m) high valves form the gas outlet.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other parameters of the incoming gas before it is fed into the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour, and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand name notebook.
Created by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours added by candlelight with the writing.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular cover, its rubber band, its egg-white pages, as if aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch a distinctive design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a technical adviser to the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old production technique called mole skin, which is a wooden lacquer used, for example, for upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was in demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has brought back to life an old and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century", explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success is coming.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and reached 12.7 million units.
This is a far cry from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook is of interest to businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of a cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded clientele.
The small Italian company, which started with 12 employees, now employs over 100 people and has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York, since 2008.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in city centres and is committed to asserting its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of the times and its new writing needs, which persist despite the rise of e-mail", explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural character is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: the brand recently launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg) " in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a leopard-shaped cover for the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural zeitgeist and knew how to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer cases... The brand has the entire range of articles.
A success that sets Neider on the map: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of the disabled remain so high?
Approximately 19% of the disabled are looking for a job.
Today marks the beginning of the 15th Disabled Work Week.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is consistently twice the average: 19% against 9% for the general population.
Discouraging you?
"No", says Éric Blanchet, director general of the Adapt association, which organises the 'Working Week for the Disabled'.
"The progress made in fifteen years is considerable".
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but triple".
"Nevertheless, there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done".
However, it must be said that for the disabled unemployed, numerous obstacles remain before they can get a job.
The elderly are more likely to suffer from this problem: 37% are over 50 years old (on average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with a higher education.
Finally, longterm unemployment is also very widespread: 53% among the disabled compared to 38% on average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter the workforce, and these are "the core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, general director of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the objective brakes.
The unspoken remains, the attitudes of mind which, although they are certain, are slowly evolving.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for the magazine La Cité indicated that the managers surveyed had "a weak level of knowledge about disabled people", which was "overrepresented" by "people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually handicapped".
The result is that private firms with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, which was set by a law of 1987.
These latter figures, which date from 2008, refer to a ratio of 2,6%.
"We are now at around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, director-general of Agefiph, the organisation responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with the law.
The evidence: the number of 'fees-paying' establishments and the total amount paid have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46 000 (and from 606 to 480 million euro).
"The 2005 law providing for contributions increases put a lot of pressure on companies", said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies".
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises employ between 20 and 49 disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
"What a stroke of luck".
Even before they were called upon to face the "Blue Tuesdays" (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had made no secret of the pleasure that the friendly match had brought them.
It would be too far-fetched to say that there was a secret understanding between them, but the picture speaks symbolically.
Sitting side by side on the podium at the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have easily made peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had not received any praise for his person.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he's Belgian".
"I want to look ahead", says the native of Liller.
As for the contrast between his depiction in Club and National Life, "It's a unit that justifies everything".
"I'm in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to go to the start".
Hazard will be coming to Saint-Denis, brought here on Friday night against Romania for the match against France, to finally "shine".
But without missing the "pleasure" part.
He has been a member of the French national team since the age of seven, and led the team to victory in the 1998-2000 campaign.
"I was always supported", he said.
This inevitably contributes to the 'unique' character of this meeting.
"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there", he said.
"We just ran into each other".
"It's a great honor to play against them!"
Leekens, on the other hand, sounded "proud" with goodness.
"Pride in playing the galamatch".
The Commission's proposal for a regulation on the European Parliament and Council's role in the European Union's work programme for the period 2000-06 is a welcome step forward.
"Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job", he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, the technician is very much looking forward to sharing the plane with the Blues (the French national team)... towards Brazil in 2014.
"We Belgian children are coming out strong", he said.
"We're planning something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You'll notice that in the upcoming games", including the game against France.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team, led by Paulo Bento, is looking forward with great optimism to the second leg against Bosnia, which will be played in Lisbon on Tuesday at 10 p.m.
Both teams had lacked objectivity in their first game.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt that La Selecçao, his national team, which he has been managing since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this is really just 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and a match to serve, and that is Bosnia.
Given Friday's 0-0 draw in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the game for over an hour, but the team was unable to put the stamp on the matter that would have taken the pressure off them.
"This is a good result, but it does carry a certain risk, as we did not score a winning goal".
But at home, in their brightly lit Stadium of Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident of beating a crowd that should be equally keen to play, even if the game was, of course, announced as 'very close', said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very close game, but we are absolutely confident that we can win", said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being in the 2012 European Championship", said the successor to Carlos Queiroz.
The draw in Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
A draw may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but it is also a risky one, as we did not achieve a break-even point", Bento regrets.
"We will be playing against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese were to apply maximum pressure on the Bosniaks at the outset, so as 'not to give them time to think'.
A good idea, provided it is put into practice this time.
