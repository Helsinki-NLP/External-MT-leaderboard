Peter Chek: The Last Minute?
Everything is possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big passage.
Another chance will only come in the winter.
Peter Cech, currently the replacement goalkeeper of Chelsea, is now not on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He is sitting at the NH Hotel in Smíchov, speaking with Czech journalists, and is going to play with the Czech team for a game general with the Americans and then for a sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea, in the new Premier League season, Thibaut Courtois is preferred, Czech for the first time in ten years in the London club has come to the position of a replacement.
There was a speculation that Real Madrid could be interested in the Czech Republic.
In the beginning of the season, he lost the Spanish Super Cup in matches with Atlético and failed to enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
There was also a speculation about Paris SG.
In the season of the French League, he scored with two victories and two remises, and St. Etienne scored 5-0 on Sunday.
The most popular is the club AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 balance in the league, and in the weekend he split with Lille peacefully 1:1.
On the bulvaric English sites today came news that they could want a Czech in Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, Cech's departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not too likely.
Skybet scored the course 4:1.
Is it possible that you will change your dress in the remaining few hours?
I don’t count on it, but in football there’s never anything a hundred percent.
There will be an offer that will not be rejected.
How should such an offer look?
“I don’t know how this offer, which cannot be rejected, actually looks like.
First of all, it would depend on Chelsea’s attitude whether or not the club would deal with the offer.
Is it technically possible to do such a transition when you are now in Prague?
Would you not need to sign a new contract in a new place?
So I did not think about it.
But in such a situation today there are a lot of players, they are all somewhere on the representative crashes and a lot of transitions will be closed today.
So somewhat realisable it would be.
How many clubs are there on the planet that can afford you?
I really don’t know it.
Are you not pushing to leave?
The situation in which I didn’t catch in the first three matches of the new season is a new situation for me after fifteen years of career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
I want to continue to participate in that match for Chelsea's goalkeeper's position and it's on the coach who will choose what decisions he will make over the next few weeks.
What role does your family play in your decision making?
I take all factors into consideration.
For me, of course, the sport is important, but I look at it from the personal side, to which the needs of the family, of course, belong.
Is it possible that you’ll be captured for another club in England?
This is the question I thought it would never affect me.
But in football everything is possible.
I don’t want to exclude anything.
I don’t know the answer.

Judge Lady Rae has set the date for the judgment on November 17th at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
The restoration of the very American idea that labour rights are human rights at the same time
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a law to protect organizations in trade unions as a civil law.
“According to how trade unions work, jobs work for the middle class,” says Ellison, Democratic Senator for Minnesota, who is co-chairman of the Congress Committee.
That’s why I’m so proud to be able, along with John Lewis’ occasional rights pattern, to introduce a law that strengthens the employee’s status.
This breakthrough legislation will give workers the same legal options as to defend discrimination in organizing in trade unions, as with other forms of discrimination – and will stop the anti- trade forces.
To regulate the Labour Relations Act in such a way that all employees who face discrimination, if they want to engage in trade unions, to judge before a civil court - and to judge compensation or compensation for damage - is a right and necessary initiative.
This is not a radical initiative – at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other prosecutors in the law propose is to regain the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have occurred in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states – the Americans once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them when the country with one breath promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to gather.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his counselors supported the country to adopt a proposed constitution to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja will be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their trade unions play a role in forming the new Japan, included the language and openly recognized that “the right of employees to gather, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers encouraged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced with a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that workers will need to be organized and promoted in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly says: “The right to establish associations that will ensure and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or profession.
Agreements that will limit this right or will seek to damage it will be repealed. measures leading to the fulfilment of such a purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, it included the applicants and Roosevelt’s guarantee that “everyone has the right to form and join unions in the framework of the protection of their interests.”
Americans for all generations have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries how to build a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create labor unions - and their participation in collective negotiations with companies and government agencies in the position of an equivalent partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are attacked in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As the reverend Martin Luther King Jr said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the trade unions have not reduced the power of the nation, but expanded it.
They raised the living standard of millions of people, created a market for industry and raised production to an untouched level.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget and we should not.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights – and the extension of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organization of trade unions – has a great delay.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis restore the ideals that raised America and made it a real promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily blocked the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
The federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the Louisiana law, which, according to lawyers, would likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
The regulation signed by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is intended to enter into force on 1 September, would require doctors performing abortion to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles from their practice.
The judge's ruling means that doctors may temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions and must, at the same time, provide that permission.
“The proposing party will be able to operate its activities legally and, in the meantime, it will obtain permission,” Federal judge John deGravellese said in a resolution.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
Activists for the right to abortion resolution, which is the last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said it would give the doctors more time to obtain permission.
“Today’s decision ensures women in Louisiana to be safe from a false law to prepare them for their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who, on behalf of three of five clinics, demanded the blocking of the law.
It was unclear immediately whether the decision applies to doctors from two clinics who were not among the applicants, and also ask for the grant of that permission.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that have approved similar laws, with the courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures by provision unconstitutional.
The key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state blocked federal judges on Friday.
Fighters for the rights of women to abortion together with the American Association of Parent and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association claim that the need to have this permission puts on the doctor requirements that are not necessary from a medical point of view.
The opponents of abortions opposed the measures aimed at protecting women’s health, and some also welcomed the fact that the clinics would be closed due to the measures.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said that in Louisiana only one abortion doctor has permission.
If all the doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure due to fear of his safety, the group said.
In response, the Louisiana authorities said they would not punish the doctors who perform abortions while waiting for the processing of the right grant.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills more frequently in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video in honor of her deceased mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in Australian rural areas are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their neighbors in the city.
Researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1,100 Australians diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after the diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
New drugs can slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers followed the woman during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival influenced the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in older women who were diagnosed with cancer in a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about twenty percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan says the factors may be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
“The disease is best treated by gynecologists, who are usually located in larger cities,” she said.
Despite improved remote medical services to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help to strengthen transportation services that will allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who treat themselves far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of their geographical location, stressing the need for better treatment and preventive programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer today will be published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, the young mother Elisha Neave from Gold Coast was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Farmers are regreting the decrease in house owners
According to a HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary decline of household owners under the age of 35 could lead to the fact that until today’s young generation of consumers reach the “main age group of gardeners”, garden centers will lose up to £10 million a year.
According to the report, people who rent houses spend on their gardens, on average, 55% of the amount spent by people living in their gardens.
As other factors threatening the industry, which earns an estimated five billion pounds a year, it reports an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of sliding instead of pre-gardens used as a parking area and the decreasing size of gardens.
In the Great London region, where the share of owned houses fell from 61 percent to 43 percent over the past six years, one household has the lowest spending on gardening products in the UK.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society said that housing in a rental or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief gardening advisor for RHS, said: “There is a very popular plant cultivation in flower houses among rentalers – when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the “gold age” of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of household owners and economic prosperity lasting from the 80s to the mid-90s.
It also forecasted higher sales for this year thanks to the better weather, which came after unfavorable conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches democracy.
After Putin, at the collapse of his youth organization, which most reminds me of the Hitlerjugend, sacked with nuclear weapons and in essence revealed to everyone that their opinions were stolen to him, he gave us today a lecture about democracy.
But I have such a feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many characteristics of a fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both the nationalism, and that the complex of inferiority can be transformed into imperialist shakes.
The time goes different in the east than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of wars for the domination of Europe has long gone, the East, on the contrary, believes they have been overlooked for a long time and need to get back their international position.
Such mood and frustration ruled in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis took power and then followed the explosion of nationalism unlike the current situation in Russia.
And then, the entirely consistent cult of a strong leader, the melting of journalists, the eradication of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, that is, therefore, quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and a large portion of the Russians are probably missing after the time when Russia ruled the half of the world and the other portion trembled before them.
Probably the Western politicians blame themselves, little Vladimir was paying on their shoulders, they didn’t invite him where he wanted, and they began to underestimate him, and he simply behaved like a typical Russian man.
He made his order at home, he seemed that he didn’t really want anywhere, and broke the knife at home.
He decided to get back to the lost position.
It starts slowly, it has time.
The leader is probably forever, so where he would rush.
The Caucasians, now the Ukrainians, are on the row of the Baltic puppets.
The Russian bear has been scratched in the skin for a long time.
This is clearly noticed by China, which is somewhat hoping out, and is definitely making a breakthrough to the Far East.
And those Germans of that Vladimir are also nice, how good they are, and that I gave them in 45 so on the ass.
How to make a new Novorosia in Karlovy Vary.
This would be a base and our are there a lot and as they are pressed there and the dachu already wanted to destroy any of them.
For our veterans so far remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Their prime minister, Mr. Sobotka, is so soft, can be cracked like the cabbage, and I sweat the whole of their EU.
That would be the way they would go to the Great Russia.
They need to remember where their place is.
And as explosives we will use our private men who live on their territory.
There are enough Russians everywhere, and when it is said they’re pushing them there, they’re simply pushing them there and we don’t let them, we’re protecting them.
And again, Russia will rule, for for what else it is born.
Europe is good only as a preface on which the proud Ivan can dance a cossack.
Turkey calls U.S. diplomat for spying news
The Turkish Foreign Minister called the highest-ranking U.S. diplomat in the country to explain the report on U.S. and British spy activities in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. charge d'affaires and Turkish officials talked on the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept said that according to the documents provided by the former analyst of the U.S. National Security Agency, Turkey was the priority target of the U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan undermined the importance of the news and stated that all major countries are monitoring each other.
The earlier report, according to which the German intelligence service also focused on Ankara, caused more angry reaction in the Turkish government.

Police Director in Magalufu Accused of Corruption
The complainants on Friday submitted to the office of the Mallorce State Prosecutor evidence of the harassment by police and state officials of the municipality in the autonomous area of Calvia.
The head of the police in Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after accusations raised by entrepreneurs and bar owners in the famous party district in Magalufu.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was arrested after he was charged with corruption by several entrepreneurs from Punta Ballena, the street where the majority of the bars and night shops are located in Magalufu.
According to the internet newspaper Mallorca Diario, on Friday, the complainants submitted evidence of the police and public officials of the municipality in the autonomous area of Calvia to the prosecutor of the Mallorce Anti-Corruption Office.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish state police for association with the accusation of corruption and together with Navarro they will be heard by a judge.
The Spanish national newspaper ABC quoted unhappy night business owners that the benefit from public officials has a serious impact on their business.
“It has long been not about making money, but about survival,” said one of the entrepreneurs at the court.
Do not play with our life.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf came to the main pages of magazines around the world after a video of a 18-year-old British tourist who provided oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour appeared on YouTube.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to monitor drunkers and drunkers in the series of participants in the Magafulu holiday parties by reducing the number of unknown alcoholic tours in the bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where there was an incident with oral sex, was forced to close for a year and together with the organizers of the bar tour of Carnage to pay a fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is popular primarily among the British, has also witnessed many accidents under the influence of alcohol including the fashion wave known as “balconing” where people jump from one balcony to the other or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day marked by rain and storms that affected the flight at the airport of Adelaide
Spring brought a ice surprise to the south of South Australia, came with strong rain and strong winds that seriously hit the airport in Adelaide.
Another 5 mm rainfall in the city is expected to fall until nine o'clock in the evening and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night on Sunday.
The last rain was presented along with a few short exaggerations associated with storms and winds that began before eight in the evening and in about ten minutes brought almost 4 mm of rainfall.
After several early spring doses came after the winter last week, the temperatures in the city fell again to just 15.8 °C on Monday.
It is believed that storm weather contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft had to land a moment after 19:30, but on short distances it was hit by a change in speed or wind direction and was forced to postpone the landing.
The wind floods at the airport of Adelaide at that time reached a speed of about 50 km/h on Earth.
Flight data showed that the aircraft had to leave from the second landing and finally arrived around 20:40.
The flight delays resulted in further flights including Emirates flights from Dubai and Qantas flights from Sydney.
According to the forecast, the temperatures in Adelaide will reach a maximum of 16 °C on Tuesday and one or two excesses may occur.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after they spent the summer in anti-bomb coverage, while during the 50 day war between Israel and Hamas, their homes were attacked by missiles and minometers.
The beginning of the school brought to the communities in the south of Israel marked attacks a sense of joy and excitement, but the signs of struggles are still visible.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the staff of the school, which was hit by a rocket, removed from the wall the remains of the stripes and slowly awaiting the return of the children.
“We’re a little afraid, but otherwise we’re looking forward,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of the Saad Kibucu and a teacher of English at the local school.
Many children in this area already really need to return to their daily routine.
Her eleven-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, revealed that “it’s a little strange” to go to school once again.
“We had a few difficult moments and we didn’t leave the house at all,” she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the people.
Until the ceasefire last week war ended, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and went to safer areas far from Gaza to escape missiles and minometers.
Many inhabitants of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border, in which a missile from a Palestinian minomet killed a four-year-old boy, hesitate to return.
According to the Ministry of Education, about 12 families have not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in replacement schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border, which was severely affected by Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study urgently, and added: “We will provide you with education and safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on unlimited peace on Tuesday.
Although the ceasefire led to an immediate ceasefire, it did not solve key problems such as Hamas’ demands to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopen the airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
The new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to the Palestinians and the United Nations, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel questiones these figures and estimates that at least half of the killed were radicals, although there is no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza shoot at Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country, 4,591 missiles and minomet missiles.
The Israeli army, in turn, carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people are hiding in hundreds of UN schools that have turned into a temporary shelter.
Due to the tens of thousands of people still hiding, and due to the ongoing struggles, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope that the school will be opened soon, so that we can complete education like Jewish children and other children in the world,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school in the largest city of Gaza.
I’m standing behind you.
And Lafatu is troubled by the temperature
The Czech football team met on Wednesday in Prague before the preparatory match with the United States and the subsequent opening match of the qualification of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
Of the twenty-three-member squad, the Spartan attacker David Lafata is in trouble.
David is not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was about more players and David is still some of the problems he has.
But we want him to be here and he is fine as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"If it will be two or three days, or tomorrow it will be fit, it will be seen according to his health, which our doctor will decide," he added.
The other players are okay.
“Naturally someone has some pain, but it’s not that they can’t train or take part in the match on Wednesday with the US,” the Czech coach said.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called as the last player of the Spartan Deputy Lukáš Váchu.
He acknowledged that this was not an easy decision, and other centropolars were taken into consideration.
I decided on the basis of the fact that Lukáš is a prospective player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I stand behind it," Vrba said to Váchov.
What about Shura?
We’ll see what’s going to happen with Latino.
It is not excluded that in case of health problems the nomination could still change.
On the weekend with great performance flashed, for example, the liberal Josef Shural, who gave a hattrick.
Of course, there are players who have recently shown shape.
Let’s see how David Lafata is going to be.
In the event that he will not be able to be available on Wednesday, I don’t say that I can’t dominate any of the players who took place in the Czech league,” Vrba said.
Today afternoon awaits the representation of the training at Strahovo, on Tuesday the classic pre-match training before the duel with the United States on Summer, which will be open to fans and followed by the autogram.
The match with the Americans will be played on Wednesday at 20:15 and the national team in it will strive for the prime victory under Vrba.
In the previous three preparatory matches he played two remises and lost one.
The qualification match with the Netherlands is on the schedule on September 9 at 20:45.
Walk to the Netherlands to Italy
He is glad that he has more time for training, unlike the previous matches.
It’s a advantage when you have players eight days and you can practice certain things with them that we may not have had so much time before.
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing ourselves as best as possible for the Netherlands,” Vrba praised.
The Netherlands will be presented before the match in Prague on Thursday in Italy and the duel will be personally watched by former temporary coach Josef Pešice.
It gives us information about what the match is.
But it’s not just about him, we’re going to have a match and we’re going to break it out.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we’ll see what changes will be there,” Vrba said to the bronz medallists from the recent World Championship.
According to highly followed statistics, the prices of apartments in the winter season have increased the most in the last seven years.
According to the housing value index in the Australian capital RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose by 1.1 percent in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase resulted in a total increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price rise rose to 10.9%, more than doubling in one year until August 2013, but the profit was not equally distributed in the country.
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said that the market leaders are Sydney and Melbourne.
The numbers of RP Data show that the prices of apartments in Sydney last year rose by 16.1%, while the prices in Melbourne by 11.7%.
Other strongest markets include Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin with an average price rise between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale, Canberra was placed, which was damaged by the state ordered expenditure reduction and where prices rose only 1.4 percent during the year.
Lawless said that when the spring begins, the number of properties to be sold will increase in the coming months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the continuing high rates of auctions, the general high sales rates and the low interest rates, the value of housing is likely to increase further over the next three months,” he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me.
He never said “I love you.”
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in the factory, they had a cold relationship.
Henry tries a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partially based on an imaginary conversation with his father and is part of the Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and the melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with a few unpleasant memories from his childhood.
After his mother’s death, Henry passed a “depth” therapy and now he is thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have only heard his voice, saying, “Stop with that crack.
Leave your sister in peace.
Go out!
I want to watch the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were already adults - went to a bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a glass of beer or the beauty of a hit in a cricket.
I have never talked to him like that.
Most of my life it was a serious guy in the corner that read the newspapers.
Recently, Henry visited the Dudley slider, and although the conditions were better than at his father's time, he looked into what life had to be for him.
Today there’s a little more light, but it’s still a dark, smoked, cloudy labyrinth where flames explode and there’s a lot of smoke and seed.
My father always went into the bath and only lie there, then it was heard how slowly he begins to sing for himself, because he smiles the slider.
When I went around, I realized that this year he did to enjoy the family, and I began to appreciate him more.
Still, Henry lived his childhood without parental love.
My father didn’t take anyone, he didn’t say “I love you.”
When my mother was sick and died, we began to say, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
His daughter Billie, which he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying “I love you”?
Do not embrace me all the time!
Dad, I am 22!
The Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
It is a great mom.
The French, with whom he has been married for 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn is good.
Why should we not be friends with Dawn?
She is a great mom.
Henry’s mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of overweight and the symptoms of diabetes began to appear, the doctor told me, “You have to make a radical change.”
So I started going to a big fitness center and I also had to keep a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
and tired.
No one wants to eat carrots.
The change in the direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-covered bracelet.
After he received recognition from criticism for his Othella, he immersed himself in the theater.
The Comedy Full of Errors and the Plots of August Wilson.
It’s a different experience than sitcoms and comedies that filled his busy working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in the factory.
DJ noticed him on the stage as he paroded someone, and wrote about him in the talent competition New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: “I’ve been the only black imitators/comics on television for a long time.”
He taught at the walk.
In addition to being noticed by the public, between 1975 and 1985, I had to learn how to invent functioning jokes, be a star and perform on television, and it was really hard.

Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production The Black and White Minstrel Show, a entertainment program in which the actors were dressed as black men, Henry eventually performed in it with his comedy for five years.
My family was unhappy for that.
I wish it never happened, but I do not regret it.
Although it was a strange and shy position, I worked on large scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was “a year and years appreciated the main product of British television”, but was at the same time also “a grotesque parody of the black.”
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and presented characters that at the same time laughed and celebrated British black culture.
The first series The Lenny Henry Show began broadcast in 1984 and in the 1990s was known among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
The next decade took him ads, documentaries, television series and film roles, but after broadcasting his series LennyHenry.tv on BBC in 2008, he said, “So what you’re going to do now, Lene, a bit it seems like you’re stuck in one place, or a bit you’re missing the way.”
Next on a row was a documentary on Radio 4 titled What's So Great About...?/What's So Great About...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was seriously allergic to Shakespeare.
We did not learn it well at school and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone with whom we interviewed in the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, “You should try it.”
Don’t get into it when you don’t know what you’re talking about.
Try a few words and you’ll see why we all like Shakespeare so much.
Henry for the document presented twenty lines of Othell's final speech and was already in it.
It gave me the feeling that I could.
As if it gave me courage.
It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, learn something about it.
So the test was hard and I read the game months and months before.
And it was a success.
They seemed to have trouble, which did not happen.
He soon started playing in a comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre.I couldn't believe it.
At a moment I thought, “You’ve changed.”
There was a technical failure and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for capturing the audience.
“The gentleman in my head said to me, ‘Before the computer is done, you have to have them for ten minutes now.’”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the show will continue as soon as the problem is solved.
I went out of the stage and something in me said, “Hm, thank God.”
This is not my responsibility.
Somebody else can solve it for me.
“You play, so stay in the role.”
Henry in the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of the plots was a challenge.
Panic is quite good, adds determination.
The game was also well accepted, so it’s like a sign of God that says, “This is what you should do.”
Of course, it says it with a sound voice.
So I stay there.
I really like it.
I love the test room.
Henry's brain remains a comedian - all the time our conversation is interrupted by humorous performances, when he enters and comes out of the role of an imitator.
I decided not to do stand-ups because having satisfaction from a room full of foreigners is a bit dangerous, I would say.
If you are still looking for something, you can get into a blind street.
Sometimes, when I want, I do Live at the Apollo, but I'm not happy as before.
I asked if he would ever make a stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in one room with a director who helps to give the contours of the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey - I don't think I would ever want to give up.
Your new incarnation?
I think yes.
I enjoy acting.
It is fun.
You are telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers government officials to take care of non-existing employees
Kenya began with the biometric registration of all its government officials to try to remove from the government’s salary list of non-existing employees.
According to the government's statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will stop receiving payments.
The government believes that thousands of people receive salaries even after they have left the public service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to avoid corruption in the state administration.
The audit conducted this year showed that the state comes with at least one million dollars (700,000 pounds) per month on the salaries of unexisting employees and with further abuse of official power.
The government is suspected that wages continue to be deposited on bank accounts even after the employee’s death or after the employee leaves the state administration, BBC’s capital Nairobi reporter, Wanyama Chebusiri, said.
All public officials must arrive within the next two weeks to the identification centers where their data will be biometrically recorded, the government said in a statement.
Moreover, he says that anyone who does not come without sufficient apologies will be removed from the payment list.
“Through the designation of actual public service employees, this measure will significantly contribute to its efficiency and will also be used to cleanse the salary list at both government levels, solving the problem of non-existing employees,” said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Thousands of Turkish police officers arrested for 'conspiracy' against the government
Local media reports that a total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey for suspicion of a “government conspiracy.”
Police have not commented on the case yet.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, fourteen high-level officials were among the detained.
Some of them were involved in the December corruption investigation, which focused on government officials including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for alleged organizing a criminal gang and telephone listening.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at that time Prime Minister) called their actions part of the Islamic Spirit Fethullah Gülen’s action against him and other people in power.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened again on Monday (September 1) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jaceňuk took his daughter to school.
At this occasion, he told the present journalists that not all schools were reopened, but that he is determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not all schools have a traditional ceremony to be held on September 1.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at the school in Slavyansk, which is attended by the daughter of Jaceňuk, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of the school is traditionally celebrated by the children wearing shorts, bringing ballons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Ron Fairhead, the BBC found a boss for hard times
It brings with it a cloud of glory from the world of banking, media management and the internal conclave of the conservative party.
He has experience in the front lines.
She began her career at the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and to the media world Pearsons.
She was the executive director of the Financial Times for seven years. she resigned from the post when her younger colleague occupied the top post in the Pearson's parent company.
It is said that its departure was approaching a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former CEO of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed private expertise: she became a government office adviser.
Her husband is a former member of the City Council.
In May, I described the work of the director as a cup with poison.
Not only is the BBC an extensive and confused entity in the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inside to the top layer of the hierarchy of the BBC’s own leadership, but also out to the voice of the public in times of unrest when things don’t work.
This is a almost unstable monopoly that demands a thorough reform.
Which director would risk to come into a complex company like the Chinese dynasty, dissolve it and thus prepare himself for a job.
It is a difficult challenge.
If it wasn’t so difficult, many people would like to see how the BBC is decreasing – its power, its finances – and how its status is revised.
With the expansion of the circle of competition and the new technology challenging the old certainty, immediate negotiations on concession fees for the BBC bring great danger.
For a modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British public purchases a share in something that is the largest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households, each of which costs only 40 pounds a day.
Moreover, the BBC’s popularity is obviously rising: at 53% of supporters compared to 31% 10 years ago.
The modes of using the BBC services have changed: Today the newspapers are displayed on my mobile phone and the shows I have passed through can be viewed on iPlayer.
But the BBC continues to remain a very loved and amazing institution.
She needs a wonderful director - I hope she has found one.
Texas Governor Perry claims that the offensive tweet did not approve
The tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, which was published on Sunday, contained an offensive image of a Democratic Prosecutor who initiated a criminal accusation of Perry of abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and another was posted on Perry’s account, which distant from the previous one.
There was a tweet from my account that was not authorized.
“I disagree with the tweet and I downloaded it,” he said in another post.
Perry's assistants did not answer the reports with questions immediately.
Although tweets were sent from Perry’s official account, it’s not clear who is actually responsible for his management.
The previous tweet posted an unpleasant, humorous picture of Travis County Prosecutor Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to prison in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay funds for her office, which brought Perry, the potential presidential candidate in the 2016 elections this month before the Grand Jury in Austin.
“I don’t always drive with a three-fold higher blood alcohol level than the permissible limit... but if so, I regret Governor Perry that he calls me to be responsible for that.”
I am the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by the Lehmberg Office.
He was charged with Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and called the accusation a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the case supervisory judge to reject the charges because the use of the laws to prosecute the longest serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry has interrupted the payments of $7.5 million from the State Fund for the Division of Public Interest, based in Travis County and prosecuting corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection caused a formal complaint of a left-oriented group of civil activists.
Perry’s official account is active – and sometimes it’s even famous.
After he ended fifth in the committee of his party in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry replied to speculation that he could already end, tweeting his own photo of running near the lake, and saying, “Here I am, South Carolina!”
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to “normal”
One of London’s most prominent developing companies warned that the housing market in south-eastern England “returned” to the normal level of activity.
Housing in the capital was the subject of high demand and rising prices and widespread concerns about the credit bubble forced the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the developing company for challenging Berkeley customers, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current budget year, the market has returned from the top point in 2013 to the normal level of transactions.”
The London housing market succeeded well during the decline, as foreign buyers flooded into the capital.
According to the statistics, only last year prices in the city jumped by 18.5 per cent, far above the average of 6.7 per cent in England and throughout Wales.
The average sales price of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose about a fifth last year and rose to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, due to the boosting pound, it is not so attractive for foreign buyers of London real estate in recent months – some of them also threatened the introduction of new real estate taxes and the talk of possible “sitting taxes” with which politicians came before the parliamentary elections in May next.
The London real estate agency Foxtons last week warned that the April revision of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter rules for loans, will also slow down the pace of market growth in real estate sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New Bank of England data on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has lowered its forecast of London real estate prices to 3 percent for 2015 based on the fact that the prices of houses have already begun to fall.
The volume of transactions, according to the real estate office WA Ellis, in the meantime in London’s most expensive neighborhoods such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington decreased by a quarter each year.
Nevertheless, the demand for housing in the capital was a blessing for Berkeley, as it increased cash for forward sales to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “The pickup after the right, well-looking housing in a good location remained the same and thanks to this, forward sales remained.”
In June, the company that from the beginning of the year to the end of April it sold 3,742 properties, almost a third more than before the peak of the 2007 crisis.
Annual profit before taxation increased by 40 percent to £380 million, revenues by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
On Monday before Pidgley’s annual meeting, he said that it is predicted that Berkeley’s annual revenues will be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual earnings before taxation will be £450 million.
The Berkeley stock stops at £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange.
Hackers have posted photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrenc arrives at the 85th Academy Awards.
Photographs of the Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence fled to the internet due to a hacker who claimed that he had a “list” of photos of hundreds of other beginner actresses.
A spokesman for the Hunger Games film star confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were true and criticized the hacker for “a obvious privacy breach.”
The authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who will publish the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker's photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan image sharing server, allegedly gained thanks to a limit in the Apple iCloud internet storage system. The alleged list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is unclear how many photos are authentic, however the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" Winstead on Twitter also criticized the act.
“I hope that those of you who look at the photos we made in private home years ago with my husband are happy with themselves,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
But Victoria Justice, known from the Nickolodeon cable television series “iCarly” and “Victorious”, denied that the photos were true.
It’s better to put it down. * intentional word play. *
Buzzfeed on Sunday evening announced that pop star spokesman Ariana Grande denied that the alleged photos were true.
Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, this is the best way to describe it, they gradually dissolved like a carton box that someone left on the rain.
Only from time to time a woman told him that he was too serious, complex, sharp, isolated, and a little populous.
And then she broke his hand.
He admitted it.
He was able to throw like a puppy, yes.
The last sacrifice of this capacity was the beginning of the love pletch, which more than usual promised to relieve him from the lonely life’s boring and give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild harsh hair and a flying heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more remote and unhostily than Port Reuben.
To the south she came with an older companion, which Kevern believed to be her aunt, who inherited the property in a wet but wonderful valley called, conveniently, Paradise Valley.
There was no one living in the house for several years.
The tubes flooded, the baths were dead spiders, the slumers signed on the windows, as if they thought that place belonged to them, the garden was grown up, and the grass reminded the enormous heads of cabbage.
The house looked like a house of child stories, scary and at the same time charming, with a garden full of mystery.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” is on the preliminary list of nominations for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The closer selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn were sitting on the chairs in a long grass and holding their hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, missing the public station, which supplied the country with comforting music and calming news, when the sight on her burned crossed legs reminded him of the old song of a long-forgotten black comedian, whom his father loved to listen to.
You have big legs.
Because of their natural aggression, such songs were no longer played on radio.
They were not prohibited – really there was nothing prohibited – they simply didn’t play.
They helped them get to desuetuda, as well as the word desuetudo itself.
People’s taste has proved what regulations and status would never be out of law, and as people, in terms of books, choose memoires, in which the poor becomes a rich man, a cook, and love novels, so the ballads are chosen in music.
The cafeteria was shaken by the day and began to play imaginary piano, and with a brutal, comic voice he singed the serenade to Aillinin's big legs.
Ailin did not understand.
“This was the favorite song from jazz pianist Fatse Waller,” he said and automatically attached two fingers to his lips.
This was always done by his father when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started like a game when he was young.
His father told him he played the game with his father.
When you didn’t give two fingers before kissing the word that began with j, it cost you a pence.
It wasn’t funny at the time, and it wasn’t funny at the time.
He only knew that it was expected from him, it was all.
He has to explain what jazz is.
Alain never heard any of them.
Even jazz, although it was not directly built outside the law, didn’t play.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There was a place in life for only one “If”.
When she started playing the melody, people wanted to know where exactly it would end.
The same with humor.
His unpredictability went to people nerve.
And jazz was the humor expressed by the songs.
Although until ten years he did not hear about Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew jazz from his father's half-time collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn’t have to say that Fats Waller was a black man.
Because of her age, she could not remember the time when the favorite singers were not black.
No laws or pressure.
A permissible society is that in which every part of it, with gratitude – with gratitude of those who were happily saved – agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of African-Caribbean origin with temperament and constitution were fit for entertainment and athletics, so they sang and run.
People originating from the Indian subcontinent, as if the nature of the talent for electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family will be without a functional phone.
The Poles who remained were the installers, the Greeks who remained washed the dishes.
Those of the Persian Gulf and Levant states whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country while what happened was happening - they feared to accuse them of putting them in the fire, they feared that the fire would spend them the next time - they opened a restaurant where the labneh was sold and they smoked water smoke, they didn't pay attention to themselves, and the inactivity slowly fed them.
Everyone according to his talent.
Since she was only listening to the ballads, Ailinn was hard to understand how the stupid words that Kavern was just singing to her could create music.
Music is an expression of love.
“In fact they’re not foolish,” Kevern said.
Per only for people with big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden supplied the illusion of safety.
A word could not escape behind the sound.
Alain did not understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he refused to put himself in her presence again two fingers to his mouth.
She thought she was strange.
“It seemed funny,” he said at the end.
She scratched her head and shattered Kevern's sight.
In the whole world there was nothing else to be seen than the confusion of her hair cuts.
He didn’t want to see anything else.
“When you think,” she said doubtfully.
It doesn’t tell me why you sing it.
She seemed really angry.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
Walk is not so.
Maybe a bit of necklaces.
Do you say you hate me because I have too thick neck?
I hate?
This is not true.
It’s just a stupid song.
He could say “I love you,” but it was too early.
“Your thick necks are just attracting me,” he tried it.
I am so a little disappointed.
It did not succeed.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often caught him in trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to be able to shake the cruelty that in the jokes cried out.
Per his father was cruel intentionally.
Per he was intentionally cruel.
Despite good eyes.
Ailinn Solomons crushed and lifted up from the bedroom, dropped the radio and dropped the undrinked wine.
There was no wine, so the drink could not.
She seemed to tremble in her anger like palm leaves in a storm.
“I’m turning up that you’re a fool,” she said.
Except that it does not attract me.
He regretted her, both because of her unsuccessful words and the fear she had in her eyes at the moment she stood against him.
Did he think he would hit her?
She didn’t talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn’t doubt that in the foundations it was the same there as here.
It was the same large and ice ocean.
The same melted men, after what happened, even more indisputable and angry than their ancestors, the traffickers and the Cascavites, angry blumed from the bar to the bar, ready to stretch the hand on any woman who would dare to reject them or laugh at them.
The fool?
If they don’t care, they will show her their legs!
The first to smell her - smell became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antibody of the mdl ballads about the love that the radio crushed - first it was smelled, then it was one killer.
According to Kevern's opinion, excessive cultivation, because mastering was in itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons neverbally suggested him to leave.
He got up from the bed as an old man.
She felt frightened, but the weight of her sadness surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They are almost unknown.
She looked away — as if she was watching him from the window in the floor — a man who was hunted, what he himself caused.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart broke out because of him and because of all men in general regardless of the fact that a couple of them beat her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders swallowed, shameful, defeated, all the struggle left him—why did it seem to her that she knew this view well, even though she couldn’t afford a single moment, until today, that she would ever see it?
Ailinn Solomons, again alone, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic thirty-two-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, an unregulatory public mood monitoring system, prepared a short article about the persistence of light and medium-sized violent acts in the areas of the country where its relief or direct stop was most expected if enough money and energy were spent on its removal.
“There has been a lot done and a lot has to be done,” she wrote, “to calm the inherent aggression of the people who fought in many battles and won the majority of them, especially in the shattered, hardly accessible places of the country, where, despite the heights of the church towers standing above the living gardens of the breath of human kindness historically rarely appeared.”
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the pudes.
The inhabitants breathe over sentimental ballads, hunt unhappy stories and declare that they strongly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas old brutality holds as hard as in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that new and aggressive intolerance appears at home, on the workplace, on the roads and even on the sports fields.
“Unfortunately, you have a tendency to a too flowerful style,” said her boss.
I suggest you to read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped his head.
I have to ask myself: Are you an atheist?
“I have the impression that I don’t have to respond to it,” Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you lesbian?
Esme again defended its right to privacy and silence.
the feminism?
Another silence.
“I’m not asking for that,” Rabinowitz said, “that I’d have something against atheists, lesbians, or feminists.
There is no prejudice in this workplace.
We serve unpredictable companies.
But a certain kind of over-sensitivity, which in itself is completely acceptable and praiseful, can sometimes distort judgment as you have shown it.
Obviously, you are predisposed to the Church — things that you call “crude” and “brutal” others could also interpret as an expression of natural strength and energy.
Still addressing what Happened, if Happened, as if Happened, if Happened, yesterday, prepares the country with its basic vitality.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head on the light table pink blinked the recommendations that Ofnow sent to the world over the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, the word singing is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
“I fully understand your reservations,” said Esme Nussbaum quietly when she was sure her boss was over, “and I don’t say that the wound was not healed as we say it was healed.
My concern is, above all, that if we are not warned in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS.
But this time we will not ventilate anger and uncertainty on others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the ends of his fingers.
This means endless patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “when you describe the steps that your grandparents may have done and may not have done as mistakes.
You’re treating too far in talking about venturing your “wrath” and “disconfidence” on “the others.”
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and in protecting the present we are not talking about “we” and “their.”
There was no “we” and there was no “they.”
We only know that it was chaotic times.
“Through which, if we are honest with each other,” Esme gathered courage, “there is no one without guilt.
I do not blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened, it happened.
That was before.
There is nothing to add – we agree with it.
And just as there is no fault to be caught on someone, there are no things to be corrected, even if the correction is appropriate and possible.
But what else is the past than to learn from it?
The past exists to be forgotten.
If I can add something to it -
Luther Rabinowitz broke his fingers.
“I’ll take your report into consideration,” he said and released it.
The day after she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who walked on the road in a way that passengers described as “brutal and angry.”
Accidents are happening.
The Army of the Lesoth Kingdom says no coup is planned - Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officials of the Lesoth Kingdom denied that they would organize a coup in order to collapse the government, and claim that they acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has fled the country and says the army has surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital Maser.
After stating that he was threatened with death, the prime minister and his family went to the neighboring South African Republic.
The army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not a coup, but an army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police tried to disarm.
“Today morning, the Command of the Defence Forces of the Kingdom of Lesotha acted after receiving a number of reports from the intelligence service that there are several groups in the rows of the police that are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were going to make the country a launch,” he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said military actions looked like an attempt to collapse the government.
"Al no one has stated that he has captured government power by force, the actions of Lesoth defence components seem to be a sign of a coup," he said.
Military officials of the Lesoth Kingdom said that the soldiers returned to their castles on Sunday and there was peace in the capital.
During Thaban’s absence, Vice Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he was the target of the attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended parliament meetings due to internal disputes, tensions have been in Lesotho.
He stated that despite the opposite claims, he did not undermine his actions to the government.
Production in the Eurozone is at the 13 month low
According to a carefully monitored survey, the growth in the eurozone slowed to the thirteen-month minimum in August.
The final Euro Zone Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) dropped from June 51.8 in August to 50.7.
A number above 50 is an expansion.
New orders remained and the factory damaged the growing tensions between the EU and Russia due to Ukraine.
The figures come from the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will ask the bank for a clear plan to deal with the distant recovery of the euro area and the threat of deflation with a stagnant inflation of 0.3%.
There have been speculations that ECB director Mario Draghi may have suggested this week that he is considering a quantitative liberation of the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the United States approached during the financial crisis.
“While at least some growth is better than any growth, the brake effect that has the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the manufacturer is increasingly visible,” said Rob Dobson, the main economist of Markit.
The production PMI of Germany, Russia’s largest trade partner in the EU, fell to the eleven-month minimum of 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France is concerned, and Italy has passed the stagnation from expansion.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands has disappeared are also not too calming,” Dobson said.
The slowdown of the industry is likely to boil oil into the fire for analysts expecting the implementation of additional monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing that can be said about the production report of purchasing managers for August is that it shows that the sector continues to grow.”
Producers in the eurozone are currently living a very difficult life, as increasing geopolitical tensions – especially between Russia and Ukraine – adds even more uncertainty to the increasingly challenging conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty of the trade proved to have affected - especially the confidence of consumers, which will likely cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially those expensive.
He said that as “more likely” it seems that the ECB will eventually have to make some form of quantitative release, “although we expect it to be limited.”
10 Years of Hell of the Survivors of Beslan: 10 Years of the Horror of the Occupied School Children Still Suffering
Ten years ago, a thousand people were detained as hostages by Chechnya radicals at a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
During the three-day suffering that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of them were children.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death during the school brutality.
Just ten years after the scary occupation of the school in Beslan, which killed 334 people including 186 children, survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatic terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to the tragedy united the East and the West, which in this catastrophic disaster led to negotiations and the future.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the school brutality.
We found amazing young people who resisted misfortune, even though the memories of hell caused by terrorists in them will continue to live.
What is their greatest wish?
That the war that now destroys Ukraine – and in which children like they were dying – has already ended.
A girl trying to get back to the destroyed school gym
It was captured by the leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov, as only in the underwear trying to get back into the bombed school gym after a bomb exploded in it.
Confused Aida desperately sought her mother, Lariss, who is now 40 years old.
They were worried that both of them were dead, but they actually survived.
“A woman told me to flee and save my life, but I couldn’t,” said Aida.
My legs were from blood.
I got up and went back to find my mother.
He was saved by a soldier.
After several operations, she thought she was fully healed, but yesterday she said, “Three months ago the pain returned.
I’m afraid I’m going to have another operation.
In my knees there were pieces of straw.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people as doctors have helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but definitely didn’t destroy it,” she said determinedly.
“It just happened to me and it cannot be changed.
One time a year I go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with our friends.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future college student Jer Gapoev were killed there.
As a child, we played together and imagined how we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start a career.
I will think about my family later.
She says she hasn’t forgotten the prison, but her memories are a little blind every year.
I'm glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we're very grateful for the help we got from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my photo on the internet as I climb through the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand that disaster and prevent it from repeating it.
The boy who escaped by the rain of the balls and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia children school start at the age of seven) and survived a three-day school enclosure in the embrace of his mother Tamara.
At that time, the seven-year-old said, “My mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie on the ground and hold her in my hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dead.
She said to him, “Fug.”
He was afraid that she was dead, he fled and on the way he saw the baby crying, he caught the baby in his hand and they fled with a bullet spray.
His father Vladimir, who caught him out, said, “Damir told me that his mother is dead.”
He says, “I couldn’t save her.”
In fact, Tamara was seeking freedom and was lying in a hospital with a wounded leg and, on the contrary, she thought her son was dead.
After they met again, she said, “I was crying with happiness.
I couldn’t believe it.
He went in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London, where then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie were declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
“The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it,” he said yesterday.
I can say that the memories are blurred.
I remember that immediately after that I threw all my pistols to play.
But today I can play computer games that shoot, and I have no problem with it.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think of myself.
I remember the children with whom I played in the courtyard and who didn’t get out.
We will never say they were killed or killed.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I was able to choose anything I wanted in the toy shop, and how I was driving a cabriolet.
But now he is worried about places like Ukraine, where he suffered as much as he and his friends suffered.
That horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
“I am very sorry for everyone who has to go through such a horror,” says Damir, who took part in the volunteer activity in the monastery last week.
I want to help a lot.
One day I want to work with the police and I hope I will be accepted to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says, “Killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine it?
I remember that silence immediately after the attack. There were no children to scream and run here, and that silence lasted a few months.
He remembered his trip to London with Damire.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that although it’s been ten years ago, I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London and how I and Damir helped.
I remember how Damir had a taste for boršč, and so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember how he played with servants in the restaurant, Damir shot them with a water pistol and they fled and played with him.
It was just a month after that horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said, “I still think the world has not changed to better over the past ten years.
Now there is war in Ukraine, people die every day and I think many children have been killed and will still be killed.
They are the same children as ours.
I think that for many people, war is just something in the news they hear when they’re tired or while they’re doing something else.
I know what these people are experiencing, what it is horrible.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it’s so sad.
Damir grew up and is a kind and quiet boy, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn’t want revenge, this doesn’t interest him at all.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he’s very close to six fellow students and from time to time he goes to the gym and burns candles there.
When he was smaller, he had trouble with it - I remember how he was sometimes lying on the sofa with a face distant from us and sometimes lying for hours.
He didn’t sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember he thrown out all of his pistols or other weapons to play. Damir's today is 17, he's higher than me, nice, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I’ve been sure for a few hours that he’s dead and that I’ll never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and stood up on my feet, I looked around and saw that hell, pieces of human bodies were everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my boy had no chance to survive this hell.
“I remember when I cried ‘Damire, flee, flee!’ but I was convinced that he didn’t hear me.
He heard it and fled.
So our life goes beyond, unlike others.
Grigorij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
The Survivor of Beslan Grigorij Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, right Grigorij today
When he escaped for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his fellow schoolchildren, fear was wrapped in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of cruelty in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, sent him to school on his first day and rushed to take his older son, Vladimir, to the university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists hit the court, so my boy stayed alone there for three days,” she recalled.
Not all alone, because we had relatives there, but all died there.
Only Gregory survived.
As this date approaches, it is increasingly difficult to think about it and talk about it.
There will be no day to remember that tragedy.
It doesn’t seem to us that it has happened a long time ago, I feel it was yesterday, some moments still come back to me.
I promise that no one will ever forget.
Continuously returning memories: The photo of Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was wrapped as a statue (right)
I remember that day Grigory was very pleased to go to school, saying he wanted to embrace his teacher.
That he was alive, I learned when I saw him on television.
In San Marino there is even a statue of the crying Grigory.
Grigorij doesn’t like to look at the picture and at home we have it hidden in a library.
I understand it, but I also think that thanks to this image people around the world know what pain we feel.
Today, Gregory says, “It is important that this does not happen again.
I doubt that we will sometimes find out the truth.
Such tragedies are always being investigated, but no one will ever find the truth.
We are investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what was the cause?
This world is waiting for something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this happens, because when you ask people, no one wants war, so how is it possible?
A decade is nothing for such a pain.
To forget a little, it takes decades.
It affected my health and I still feel it.
I had three or four years due to a nightmare attack, but then it improved.
When I went back to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and colleagues who were killed.
When the 1st of September is coming, I am going to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is a past.
I don’t forget, but I don’t regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I finished my school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiovascular.
I first wanted to enter the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but because of my health I couldn’t.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won’t go.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived even though he was held at the legs of a murderer
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the foot of a murderer during the attack, yet he was able to survive
When the attack was in full flow, he was caught imprisoned in a gym while sitting next to the bomb at the legs of a murderer terrorist.
It is a miracle that he survived.
“It seems to us as if it was yesterday,” Gregorij said, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but because of the injuries he suffered during the attack, he couldn’t.
It’s still with me, it’s not something I’ve thrown in my head.
Now I’m older and it’s said that children with bad experiences can deal better – I have to say that it’s not true.
“I went to a psychologist in 2006 and then I was a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I was tired.
I will never go there again and don’t want me please to show you where I sit on that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregorij Farniev on a laptop with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know that I don’t like to think about it or talk about it and they never ask me at school.
When it comes to physical health, I’m okay.
I have to be careful about my knees that I have wounded, but I’m already walking normally.
But yet, because of my health, I couldn’t enter and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents including medical reports and they answered me that it was not possible.
My other favorite is animals, so I went to the veterinary.
I was there for the second year.
He learns how to treat all animals from “cats to cows”.
He said, “I know that I will never explain it to my children.
It’s not something children should know about and no longer anything they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This pain will always be here.
It is inside and deteriorates with the coming anniversary.
I will take part in commemorative ceremonies.
I know Gregory will not go.
It must be even stronger for him, because there, unlike me, he was.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn’t help him.
I am so grateful to God that he returned it to me. here in Beslan there are traces everywhere.
It remains with us.
Gregory is now an adult, but the horror continues.
It’s hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He’s a boy, he loves sports, but he can’t do it because of his knees.
He has undergone several operations, he can walk, but he cannot exercise.
I would say that from 50% it has already overcome the horror, but to overcome it completely and forget it cannot be.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
During the attack many of our friends and neighbors were killed and this pain only worsened.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but I am suffering by the loss of the dead.
I know the families in which other children were born, but also the widows who did not come again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want.
I will never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I’m watching what’s happening in the world – wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past we were one friendly country, so how did we get to the fact that we are fighting together now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could thus gather all those rebels and throw them away - as far as it can be.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The child carried a special commando.
Rescue: Alyonu Tskayev carries into a secure Russian Special Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and she doesn’t remember the tragedy at all.
In 2004, the world was flourished when a Russian police officer brought the little Alyon in his arms from the Beslansky prison.
The terrorists released her, but kept her thirty-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhara in prison in the school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old at that time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan married again and with her new wife Svetlana they have a girl who after the dead daughter they named Kristina.
Neighbors say Alyona, who is now ten, doesn’t remember the attack at all and has grown up a wise and happy girl.
A close friend said, “It’s a great happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great children.”
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep the children away from the memories he commemorates on his 10th anniversary.
You can understand why.
Man accused of crushing a girl on the passage to a sign in Fife village
A 70-year-old man has been sentenced to trial for crashing a three-year-old girl on a sign in the village of Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit the girl at a passage in Pittenween in East Neuk.
Prosecutors claim that Stewart did not drive his Audi Q3 with sufficient care and attention and wounded the girl.
Stewart (78) of Anstruther denied the charges at the Dundee court.
Judge Charles Macnair has set the date for January.
4 tips for getting better photos and videos under the water
If you are interested in photography or underwater filming, you have a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera of the type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs around $300.
These photos I took on a family celebration with several cameras, all of which cost less than $350.
It doesn’t matter what equipment you use, but a few rules apply to the best results.
Check out equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery and other parts are firmly locked.
Additionally, set the camera according to the type of photos or videos you’re taking.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or recording mode that optimizes exposure to dark underwater environments.
And before you get into it, find out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed only to 5 feet, the next to 50 to 60.
Read our guide to the purchase and evaluation of digital cameras in both regular and waterproof performance.
Always make a few pictures – a lot of them won’t come out.
Compact cameras have LCD that will help you with the composition of photos, but outdoor cameras do not have it.
Even if you have LCD, underwater will be badly visible and the composition of the recording will be unpredictable.
Always make more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with a slightly different exposure spread, take advantage of it.
Stay close to the level.
With deeper immersion, the light decreases significantly.
If possible, keep yourself while photographing in a swimming pool, lake or sea near the level.
This will also allow you to capture more light on the photos - the deeper you dive, the less colors you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
This is a great advice if you photograph on land, but under the water is even more important because of the more suppressed light.
This is important if you’re filming with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a solid and wide angle of the lens, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality was able to change things even in such a huge organization as NHS.
As anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieving the sick from the pain caused by disease and treatment.
His wife remembers that one of the people who sought his help was a MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of torture that smashed him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnoses and diseases, treated patients in the vast majority are interested in something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007 he was the one who began to suffer.
“I don’t feel in my skin,” he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He faced the symptoms of flu and found that he was impatient and his wife Juliet included with regrets.
He said, “I want everything to happen earlier than later.”
When Juliet went for a week on a job trip, Lawson was unusual and unexplicably annoyed.
Something was wrong.
He made a X-ray of his chest.
Two weeks ago, he skied in the French Alps.
The X-ray results have arrived.
He had a mezotelioma, an unhealing tumor that affects the brush or if the outskirts of the lung.
For most types of cancer, it is difficult to determine what was their cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer have smoked.
The Mezotelium is different.
In almost all cases, the cause of exposure is asbestos - a fiber building material, which was previously referred to as "miraculous", but today it is known to be fatal.
For most of us it was not difficult to ignore the mezotelium.
After all, Azbest belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in the industry entered into force.
Even at the time asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as isolation depositors, builders, tesaers, and shipping workers.
Toxin used in the industry in another era is hard to appear today as a reason to worry.
Such selfishness is not in place.
In the UK, the epidemic of mesotelioma is at the peak.
The number of deaths on mezotelium is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year from this disease is twice as much as the number of victims of car accidents.
The number of deaths caused by mezotelioma per year since 1980 and the estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason we only now feel its effects, although the use of azbest has been illegal for years (all kinds of azbest were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades to develop mezotelioma.
The disaster in the form of a mezotelium does not only affect the veterans of the construction industry.
Azbest has been, and in many cases it is still, present in the homes in which we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops where we shop.
The Mezotelium therefore does not respect the social layer, wealth, profession or age.
Privileged gardens from London business houses to public schools do not represent a shelter.
It is also full of asbestos.
Even hospitals where they should treat us are the storage of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He did not isolate.
He tried to find out where he could come into contact with azbest.
Then he came to it.
“It’s possible that a lot of asbestos was in the underground corridors of Guy’s Hospital, where I spent six years on practice,” he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gateways - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, this was a question that he was able to answer in part.
“Four of the doctors who were practising at the Guy’s Hospital and who have shown mezotelioma in the past five years,” he noted in a letter in 2010, “I’m the only one still alive.”
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is not usual.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mezotelioma die within eight months of the diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
Now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us are suffering from the same disease?”
According to the leading British mezotelium expert Professor Julian Peta, the best estimate is that between the years 1970 and 2050, when the azbest epidemic takes place in the UK, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them are not aware that they will die in this way.
Azbest Mines in Quebec, Canada
With a parallel look at the records from the archives of the courts, to which the persons with disabilities often turn and require compensation, it shows how much the mezoteliomic disaster has spread.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted to exposing Janice Allen asbestos due to negligence.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised in two shops on the clothing section - one of the places was the flag ship of the company, the shop on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when he started working for M&S.
Today he has two children who are over twenty.
“Before it happened,” she says, “I’ve never heard of mezotelioma before, I hardly knew anything about asbestos.
I never thought in a dream that he could touch me somehow.
There’s not a lot of people who know about asbestos.
In fact, azbest is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name was given thanks to its fibrosis structure, which gives it strength and weakness.
Three of the six minerals were used in the construction industry.
Most often, it is possible to find chrysotil, commonly known as white asbestos, in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor plates, boiler tenses and even in brake coatings.
It is not as fatal as other forms of asbestos, but the EU and the WHO still consider it a “big health risk” that can cause death.
More dangerous are brown asbestos (amosit) and blue asbestos (crocydolit).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos and experts say that “there is a convincing but indirect evidence that it was the main cause of unusually high incidence of mezotelioma [in the United Kingdom].”
Employee Marsk & Spencer has been exposed to azbest at a flag store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of mezotelioma, but the work of Julian Peta points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His patient study claims that “a substantial part of the cases of mezotelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exposure is caused by the “common use and ventilation” of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the center of the government may not guess that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that the office lifts and pipes behind the parliamentary committee rooms are contaminated with azbest, whose deadly fiber could be violated by something as harmless as “a strong air stream.”
Ministers are often accused of only taking care of their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although the Office of Parliament Services insisted that the Westminster Palace would receive a “worthy medical certificate”, it is now expected that one million pounds and several years of work will be needed to thoroughly review the Parliament, modernize electricity and eliminate azbest, and that after the 2015 elections, the MPs will be sitting in the rooms of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Center rather than on the Green Places in Westminster.
In Goddard’s report it states that “the presence of azbest is not in accordance with several regulations.”
It is impossible to say if this disagreement will cost lives.
Now everyone can only wait.
One of the people who never were able to determine when they were exposed to asbestos was Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) is suspected of being exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was proven,” he says, “but in my case I can’t prove it.
It’s hard to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But he remembers the day in early December 2009, when he got something like a cold.
He was 45 years old and was in the middle of the operation.
Suddenly I broke.
It came suddenly.
I was terrible.
I thought I would not go home by car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain was based on the brush, the outskirts around the lungs.
But just like Janice Allen, there was no reason to believe that it was a mezotelioma.
He spent a month at home.
Confused doctors made him a X-ray of the chest and introduced him a chest catheter to remove the fluid from his lungs that they sent to the examination.
They did not make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after he exercised and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients with similar symptoms arrived at the operation hall and was diagnosed with mezotelioma.
Even then, Abbott did not link anything to his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and at work he got into direct contact with azbest.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray images with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, a camera-equipped sonda was introduced to him in the space between the chest and the lung chest.
I am optimist.
I have a tendency to do nothing too much,” he says.
To be honest, I did not worry about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year: “They told me it was a mezotelium.”
Graham Abbott diagnosed with mesotelioma
Abbott began to meet with sisters from the Macmillan charity and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
He realized the extent of the epidemic.
“It has been shown that azbest has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have azbest thermal insulation in the pipes,” he says.
In people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now beginning to manifest.
So, Mezoteliom is now starting to affect younger people who do not have a risked profession.
The most dangerous thermal-isolated tubes were found in the underground in hospitals, so it was unlikely that they would threaten patients.
However, staff members who passed through the subterranean corridors between the buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in the subterranean dining rooms (such as often Graham Abbott) surely came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now shows, several decades after the war, hospitals were a place where they could save the lives of patients, but also a place that could threaten the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is still being eliminated.
Students build Bunsen's cahan on asbestos
It’s not just a hospital.
Azbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries and municipalities due to its excellent insulation and non-burning properties.
In schools as well.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos already in school.
Somewhere, in countless chemistry hours, students built Bunsen's cahan on an asbestos.
A web site has been created on the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things such as floor plates or roofs of tools in our homes usually contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison built into a large number of houses,” notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his case against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with azbest occurred, which a woman suffering from mezotelioma could remember, in the 1970s, when a garden house was broken.
So be careful when you break the garden house.
Being aware that the disease is untreatable, the effect of the diagnosis is huge.
“It takes a while for you to do it,” says Graham Abbott.
I returned to work and tried to continue, but I found that I couldn’t focus on what I did.
I was in the operation room for two weeks.
Then I realized I had to go and deal with myself.
I’m not going to live next Christmas.
One of the hardest things was the transition from the doctor’s position to the patient’s position.
As countless patients before him, he also remembers how confused he was with the amount of information he had to deal with.
“It was hard to understand it all,” he says.
I asked my doctor, “How much time have I left?”
I was told that twelve months.
I remember how I said to myself, “Well, I’m not going to live next Christmas.
So is it.”
Mezotelioma is destructive, because the mechanism of what keeps us alive – the breath itself – is what causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mezotelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Azbest is made up of small fiber.
When the asbestos are broken and the fiber is inhaled, they can settle in the cartilage, the lungs.
Asbestos fiber irritates the cartilage and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem is inhaled asbestal fiber in the shape of needles,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiovascular surgeon who entered Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
In the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically the leading center in the treatment of mezotelioma.
Treasure Lawsona knows and treated other patients who were likely exposed to asbestos during a hospital practice.
Asbestos get into the lung tissue, Treasure says, and “the breathing itself pushes them to the edge where the shell is located.
It is invasive from the very beginning.
On the mezotelium, the common treatment options used in other types of cancer do not take so much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is discussed.
Some think it is worth an attempt.
Treasure does not agree.
“You can’t remove the pudding,” he says.
You won’t get a scalp around it.
Cancer “too much does not respond to chemotherapy” which, though “has some effect”, but does not cure.
“Sometimes there’s someone who survives lung cancer,” Treasure says.
But at the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years since his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After discovering the mezotelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and advisor for equally affected people.
When they called, he joyfully presented himself, “Good day, you called to the Cancer Center.”
“He was very positive,” says Abbott.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott was offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would take four months, and likely would extend his life by just a month.
“I was desperate,” he said.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson “can show things in a more optimistic light.”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduskim from the Department of Breast Surgery at Guy's Hospital.
“I had the advantage that I didn’t have to wait until they sent me to him, but I just called there and they looked at me,” Graham acknowledges.
The normal patient would have to receive the application and they would have to approve the payment.
In order to get to the best available treatment, the issue of money is key for patients with mezotelioma.
But when different treatments eventually inevitably fail, many patients face another financial concern - about the future of the family they leave here.
They are going to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgana from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Since 1898, it was known that azbest is harmful to health,” says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was discovered that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we encounter the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled, but according to Morgana it wasn't a "full-value settlement" because Lawson couldn't definitively prove that mezotelioma was the result of the exposure to azbest at Guy's Hospital.
After investigating the case, however, a spokesman for the Guy’s Hospital confirmed that “asbestos in the incriminated subterranean part was removed in the 1990s.”
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Azbest
Cheating the exposure of deadly asbestos to one company or place of work – usually decades after it happened – turned out to be a huge problem for patients with mezotelioma seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed owners or failed.
The insurance card is lost.
And those who are now defending the charges have time on their side, which their prosecutors definitely do not.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation was approved this year, making it easier for patients with mezotelioma to demand compensation, even if their former employer is not possible to be searched.
The law created a 350 million financial reserve paid by insurance companies, which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos but have no one to appeal.
In such a case, the persons with disabilities will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court would normally assign to them as compensation – approximately £120,000.
Every year, 300 successful applications are expected.
Andrew Morgan, like the patients with mezotelioma, thinks that £350 million is a “good job.”
“This is an agreement signed by insurance companies for insurance companies,” he says, pointing out that the amount is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if time did not interfere and people with a mesotelium would be able to find the former employers and normally claim them.
Even Mike Penning, the former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law had “spaces.”
But Penning and Morgan acknowledge that due to seven deaths each year, quick negotiations were needed.
“People suffer too much and need help immediately,” Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the mezotelioma law.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, which he thought, unlike Tom Treasura, had a positive effect.
After the operation followed radiotherapy and chemotherapy – a triple treatment, in which Lang-Lazdunski can rely on a five-year survival rate in up to 40% of patients.
Abbott has strengthened it.
“But that’s not the most important thing,” Abbott says.
Patients see it all the time.
There is something that drives you.
When you give up, your condition can worsen very quickly.
Graham Abbott was undergoing an operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Inspections did not show any symptoms of the disease.
I went to the next check in March [2014].
I had a number of spots [cancer] in my chest.
My 50th birthday is just coming.
It does not threaten life.
Take him it.
Abbott again underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Currently, there are no traces of tumor in his body.
It is a physical and emotional process.
You have to think about practical things - about financial assurance, when I die, or to show a woman how the alarm on the boiler works.
When you learn the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As for the fathers Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14) it’s not always easy.
“It’s hard for my parents,” he says.
It’s hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition means I’m never old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told my friends and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more resilient.
He didn’t say much.
Such interviews must be faced by all cancer patients.
However, in patients with mezotelioma, such conversations are not relieved by hope or just an indication of a chance of survival.
The disease brings (and ultimately brought to Stephen Jay Gould) unpleasant certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mezotelium does not threaten life.”
The bodies of the pharaohs are packed into an azbest plate.
Azbest fiber is used to strengthen the cooking pots and increase heat resistance.
Plinius the Elder describes asbestos.
It has been invented a fabric that is unburning.
I saw out of it made towels that glowed in the candles at the dining rooms.
In Italy, azbest begins to appear in commercial use, it is used to produce paper (even banknotes) and fabric.
Large asbestos mines are opened in Canada and South Africa, shortly afterwards in America, Italy and Russia.
During the industrial revolution, it is an excellent insulation material in steam engines and turbines.
The global production of asbestos is increasing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Prudential’s statistics show that people working with azbest have a higher mortality rate and they are then rejected life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke confirms that the azbest particles in her lungs “was undoubtedly the cause of her death.”
This is the first case of this kind.
Kershaw’s employers, Turner Bros. Asbestos, refuse responsibility.
They will not pay any compensation.
During World War II, ships are intensively being built, work in ships represents the highest risk of exposure to asbestos.
Prohibition of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful lawsuit for health damage caused by exposure to asbestos in the UK.
The global production of asbestos is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tons per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139,000 tons.
The British Institute for Health and Safety requires that all asbestos suppliers have a license.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
In the UK, the use of all types of asbestos is prohibited.
In the United Kingdom, the law on mezotelioma enters into force.
A $350 million compensation program is launched.
Asbestos are banned in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbestos is still used as a cheap building material.
The global production is on two million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong authority to choose leadership - protesters promise revenge
China's parliament on Sunday decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for elections in 2017.
It is likely that this step will trigger long-loved protests in the Hong Kong shopping district as the activists began to organize and plan just a few hours after this announcement.
The People's Congress in essence allows communist leaders to remove any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
“It didn’t surprise us, but it annoyed us,” said Emily Lau, the President of the Democratic Party.
That’s not what Beijing has promised.
People are lying in Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we have to do with an authority regime.
To defend the Chinese decision, Deputy Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress Li Fei said that allowing public nominations in the Hong Kong leadership elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain has returned Hong Kong administration to China, Beijing has promised that from 2017 the people will be able to vote for the executive power.
The Chinese leaders presented the Sunday decision as a democratic breakthrough, as Hong Kong allows direct voting, but the decision also clearly shows that the Chinese leaders hold firmly in the hands of the nomination process, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded one of the largest and most observed protests in Hong Kong in several years.
The majority of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are behind the Central Occupation Movement with Love and Peace, whose organizers threatened with closing the financial district unless Beijing granted them the general voting right.
On Sunday evening, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Rain Occupation movement gathered in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement is entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that a wave of protests will begin in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, obviously they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement “was considering the occupation of the Central only as the last step if all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and no other choice remains.
We have to announce with regret that today all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central is inevitable.
Hong Kong authorities were preparing for Beijing's announcement all days and on Sunday strengthened the protection of the headquarters of the government and deployed police and barricades.
The incitement is a sign of Hong Kong’s slow loss of control over the city.
The flood of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of products and services.
There are also increasing concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are shaken by the growing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Central Occupation movement and say their demonstrations are threatening the trade - the rescue boat of Hong Kong.
“The protest he talks about could cause much greater economic damage depending on how many people will participate and for how long,” says Regina Ip, a politician who has long been criticizing the movement.
We do not want Hong Kong to get out of control.
This perception could harm investments.
China’s state media has also in recent days come with reports that democratic activists in Hong Kong describe as deceitful agents controlled by the West.
In the summer, the activists organized an informal referendum on voting rights, which attended 780,000 participants – more than a fifth of the Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands of people attended one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the region's history.
Pre-election agility ?
The League in Jihlava is named after the political movement
There are approximately 1,600 amateur athletes in the city of Vysočina.
And their highest competition is newly named Together for the Jihlava League.
The name was given by a movement that goes to the October municipal elections.
The twelfth on his candidate is, in addition, the head of the small crop in Jihlava Jan Mráka.
“There was a general meeting where there was no problem with it,” Mráka said.
The situation around the first league was already addressed by the lawyers of the Yehuwa Municipality and recommended a change in the system of allocation of grants.
Last year, according to the city’s website, the small crop gained about a million crowns.
This year, there are hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure is not a small crop in conflict with the law or the directives of the magistrates.
But the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for the allocation of grants and grants," the spokesman for the Magistrate Radek Tulis said.
To take subsidies from the city and at the same time express as a small crop support in the elections to one political party, it is probably no longer going.
For the high-level "big" football, such a demand from the politicians has not yet come.
That would have been created by the CSSD district, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
Classes and similar competitions.
I would not be pro.
On the contrary, I would like to have sponsors from the companies turned to us,” said Miroslav Vrzáček, the chairman of the regional football union.
The head of the small football other party and the movement to the title of the league will not let
According to the players of the small cottage, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own campus with six playgrounds, clothes and social facilities.
“For example, the stadium is not our, we are in rent there,” said Ondřej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
But there will be built, for example, according to my opinion, an immaculate area for skiers, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava," Mráka said.
Mayor Jihlavy Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) reacted that the small cottage uses the field with artificial grass in the streets of Rošického and Na Stoupách, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build such fields that have the maximum use.
We are planning to modernize or build sports facilities at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think it has made huge progress for a small crop in the past few years,” Vimeo added.
Other political parties in the names of the leagues will not appear, according to Jan Mráka.
We have restrictions.
If someone from one industry enters our partnership, then we don’t give the other there,” he explained.
“Political movement in the name of the league, I think it is at least a misfortunate step,” said Karel Voldán, a member of the municipal committee for sport.
“But let the voters evaluate whether Mr. Mráka is using the association of Little Jihlava and the subsidies of the city for political purposes or not,” he added.
American tradition penetrates university life - the first ones can fly with a jet plane
We are glad that we can respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in the UK.
In order to leave the best impression when you arrive at the university, the company also offers transportation options including a private drill or cars such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also said the service has its own security side.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drive their stuff across the state in a dangerously charged car.
We look forward to making our VIF (very important fresher - very important champion) variants this year to ensure that students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that since the services were just launched, they have no reservations yet, but added: “Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that although students pay an annual school fee of £9,000, it expects the service to find its place on the market.
Compared to the students of ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today’s students are different in terms of expectations and desires – it’s more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the right way to it.
The National Union of Students, however, criticized the service as unavailable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is unavailable.
Many students who go to the university this month have to deal with the financial crisis before throwing thousands of pounds for something as simple as to get to the college, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants can’t stick with the rising costs of basic needs.
Feminist women protest against racism and police behavior in Ferguson
Earlier this month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed young man.
The presents waiting for the funeral with their hands up and scand, “Hands up, don’t shoot!”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri for the shooting of unarmed young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez recorded a shift in the internet discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and equal income, white feminists prefer sex to race.
With the growing tension in the Middle West, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noticed that the reaction of the white people was 100% focused on the race.
Compared to the reactions of the black people shortly after the shooting on August 9, personal articles with titles such as “Feminism is not just about the oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
Perez said this is an important change.
“I think there’s not a lot of people in the feminist movement who would talk about race and privileges at such a level,” she said.
People felt that what happened had to be expressed.
This is characteristic of the crisis that we are facing, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racist that they had to notice it.
According to Corith Mitchell, a professor of English at Ohio State University, Ferguson brought the light of the problems that African-American women have to face every day and which in the cultural sphere are not perceived as “women’s issues.”
“I can post funny stories of my life with my partner on Facebook and it will get 150 characters from people from all over the world,” Mitchell said.
When I write something about the fact that colorful people are in the trap in their own country, it’s silent.
“How is it possible that a woman can speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in the public space?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have dealt with the issue of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between the issues of race and gender.
According to her, the black women could not afford luxury to clearly divide these problems: they live every day in this mixed reality.
Although white women today combine the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor lecturer of women’s question and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black people were lynched and the reason was in almost all cases white woman rape,” Hattery said.
To justify the lynching you needed the cooperation of the white.
According to Hattery, the gap between the white and the black came when voter fighters like Susan B. Anthony explored the fields at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people could have the right to vote - women or black people.
“They decided to bet cards on voting rights for women and on black people’s right to focus later,” Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why colorful women don’t believe in white.
We did not do a good job.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to start organizing against lynching in the Southern Women’s Association for the Prevention of lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after the black women first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the discouragement of white feminists’ responses to the questions that the events in Ferguson brought – the question of police behavior, racial discrimination – reflects the time when white feminists had to “go” the questions with which black women faced generations.
“Will it not be great if activists in these spaces [traditional feminism] take the right to raise a child as seriously as they take the right to contraception?” said Mitchell.
The second wave of feminists, who have made a career in the struggle for reproductive law and access to contraception, now find out what it means.
Feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot by a Facebook attack, where they posted a column of Guardians' Rebeccy Carroll, who demanded the White Americans to protest more sharply against racism.
“I hope that women who have different but yet similar reasons to understand the dangers in society – and the opinions on the race, which are significantly different in public opinion surveys – will pursue change,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem supports intersectional feminism, which includes racial and gender issues, her comments on the racial issue in America some people catch.
Christina Sommers, an expert at the American Enterprise Institute, author of the book “Who Stole Feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are “more vulnerable than their sisters,” but the comments of the Stein Party of Ferguson are faced with criticism that she has triggered before.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost no for boys.
But when the White House launched a small My Brother's Keeper program, which was intended to help vulnerable young black people and Hispanics, it caused many feminists including Glory Stein's angry reaction.
Police’s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that gets to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police arrested this year in the southwest of the country 63,000 unaccompanied teenagers, the question of the reform of immigration laws has emerged again – this time as a women’s question.
Andrea Mercad, co-chairman of We Belong Together, the organization that mobilizes women for the reform of immigration laws, said that in order to present the question as necessary for women, the only thing she had to do was to share the stories of immigrants.
“They speak for themselves,” says Mercad.
Since most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
“These stories have an influence in women’s organizations,” she said.
Swine housing in Ipswichi for sale
The real estate office removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when she published it, it was resting on it in the living room of a pig.
One-room separate house, which is for sale for £120,000, stands on a private road in Ipswichi.
Information photographs included a picture of the living room, in which he rests with his head on the sofa of a pig.
Reality office Connells said that the pig on the photo is the pet of the owners.
“The photo was found there by mistake, and therefore it was already removed,” the office spokesman said.
In the property information, the real estate office of Connells described the former prayer room as “a single separate one-room house.”
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house caused interest on social networks, where some asked if the pig is included in the price.
After winning the lottery, Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest.
A lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
The search is ongoing for a new millionaire in south-eastern Perth, one lucky man takes $1.1 million from the Saturday’s lottery draw home.
Harvey’s traffic has been happy in sharing for the second time in five years, the last time in November 2009 it was a million-dollar win.
The winner must only be registered.
The store owner Steve Forward said that the whole city in the southwest of Perth is talking about the win.
This is the main topic and everyone is annoyed.
We thought that the victory was a touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia shared one win last month, ending several happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of the five millionaries in August and just a few weeks earlier, a couple in Belmont won incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple has waged for twenty years and said the win will allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey Millionaire is the 59th only winner of the Western Australia lottery for this year, winning a total of $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn train will not run.
Manufacturers want higher wages
GDL in a press release described the protest as a warning strike, for which it deliberately chose time outside the traffic peak.
By the chosen time of the strike, GDL takes into account many people who return on the railway from the weekend until during the first working day.
At the same time, we’re also thinking about people going to work during the day,” the trade union said on Monday morning in a press release to announce a strike.
“Our first strike should affect mainly the cargo transport, less passengers,” GDL added.
The DB has not yet announced an official response to the announcement of the strike.
It is also unclear how the protests will affect international railways, among other things with the Czech Republic.
The trade unions demand a five-percent increase in wages and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
Currently, the average wage of machinery managers ranges between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year depending on the working years.
The engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DBs refuse to move on to increase wages by shortening working hours.
They emphasize that the remuneration assessment of the machinery managers must be developed as with the other railway staff, for which DBs do not count on the shortening of the working week.
It threatened that Christ’s car would start burning.
The Barum Rally ended.
What exactly happened?
It was a defect of material.
The car was completely new, so I didn’t even think something like that could happen.
Did it not be temporarily repaired and continued in a slower pace to the service, where would the mechanics replace it?
If we were going straight there, then yes.
But we were waiting for another two erzets and it didn’t.
There is a high temperature in it and the risk that the car will begin to burn was great.
I can’t afford it.
You have completed five speed tests.
What was your impression of them?
very good.
I felt like a young man.
We were fast, but I didn’t go through the wind.
Everything was caused by the fact that the car we pipled for more than a half year to be on some level.
The race showed that we succeeded.
You broke it so that you could really think of the victory.
I made my car so that we really had a win.
The work did not come.
The result we could think about was not achieved.
That’s a Barumka.
The tech said no.
You were not the only one in the top who resigned early from the struggle for the primacy.
There were also foreign favourites Breen, Abbring and Lappi.
Did you be surprised that so many favorites resigned?
Yes .
It was a disappointment for the audience, because the race ended early.
During a long time, Jaromir Tarabus was on the top, which you’re going to drive a car.
But he paid for the fact that he went out of the track and took a almost two-minute fault.
How did you be satisfied with his performance?
It’s a shame, because he could repeat the winners.
The first two times passed.
But Mira also confirmed that the car was well prepared.
He went very fast.
Just a year ago you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum rally.
Can a good feeling of driving make you a regular rally player?
Certainly not at this moment.
Last year I said Barumka was my last race and I did not follow it.
I decided to go her again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance again in a year, I'm going to do it.
But I don’t think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the trail just because of you.
Have you been pleased?
To a certain extent we started just because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, were constantly asking if I would go.
I wanted to make them happy.
What’s waiting for you after the barbecue?
The team continues.
Next week we will go to Vishkov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn’t hurt much.
In addition, he wants to borrow the Fabia Honza Sykora for this race from us.
We are in the middle of the European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We will have to prepare things for next year.
Can you suggest something?
Nothing is decided.
When the Corsica Rally belonged to the World Championship, the fifth place you reached your maximum in the series.
Do you want to try the trails again?
It does not.
Oral agreement with the employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you haven’t allowed yourself to issue a doctor’s insufficiency certificate, which serves as proof for the organization that you can’t perform your job duties for health reasons.
You did not immediately notify the employer of your absence.
After that, it was agreed that those days would be recorded as holidays, but the agreement was made only orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose the obligation to let the employer's consent to take a leave be confirmed in writing, in practice this procedure has been proven.
If there is only a oral agreement, you have no confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to taking a vacation, as in your case, may be denied and the absence at work may be considered as a long-term unforgiven absence, thus a reason for the immediate cancellation of the employment relationship according to § 53 of the Labour Code.
In the case of a legal dispute with the employer, there is no proof.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been cancelled in accordance with § 53, only you have the given days listed in the bill as an unforgiven absence.
The unforgiven absence in the bill does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the impossibility to obtain material insurance in unemployment), yet it makes it difficult to find a new job.
We advise you to visit the doctor again and let yourself confirm in writing that there was actually an accident, resulting in which you were unable to work (this is not the so-called "insufficiency", it is only a doctor's document).
When looking for a new job, you can submit the aforementioned document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issuance of a written medical certificate of incapacity, as well as the early notification to the employer or the request for a written consent to taking a vacation.
You will avoid any complications.
Tony Stewart crashes when he returns to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just a bit behind the half of the Atlanta Motor Speedway racing track.
Stewart got into play for the second time after his right front tires broke in the 172nd round, and the race for him ended.
Stewart brought the damned car into the garage, not commenting to reporters and left.
His team chief Chad Johnston said the 14th car team is disappointed, but will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
“I want us to have a better performance and a better conclusion,” Johnston said.
We’re going to Richmond and we’re hoping we’ll be better there.
Stewart got into play for the first time in a Sunday evening race after a collision with Kylie Bush, requiring a repair of the right side of his car.
“In today’s race we’ve put hope for a good finish,” Johnston said, adding, “It just didn’t work.”
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was charged and the team was packed and ready for departure.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a New York race, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to get a place in the table.
He returned to the race during the investigation of the tragic accident in which the twenty-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. died, who entered Stewart during the race.
The investigation of the cause of the accident will take at least two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-fold champion had a warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started on the 12th place, at the beginning of the race he worked on the 10th and then even on the 4th.
Then, at the beginning of the 12th round, the Busch's car No.
18 got out of control, came out of the second turn and hit Stewart, thus sending the two cars to play.
Stewart continued, but dropped to the 21st place.
Prague has chosen a new tax station manager, earning $12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for the new tax service manager.
For 103 parking stations it receives approximately 12.3 million crowns per year.
Until recently, for the same places for taxi drivers, the taxpayer collected 150 thousand crowns per year.
This was by the councillor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city used losing when choosing administrators.
The winner then received a rental for a fixed amount of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
The amount of the offer is currently determined.
"A year since the discontinuation of the original rental contracts and the opening of tender proceedings has proved that the new rental system is far more advantageous and generally more fair for Prague," the council said.
The most expensive is on the perforation.
The highest price was offered by those interested in a place in the street.
It will pay $2.1 million a year.
Approximately 1.5 million kronor new administrators paid for places in front of the Municipal House or on the Vaclav Square.
The new rules for the rental of taxi stations were adopted by the council in the autumn of 2012 and the original rental agreements were terminated in the summer of last year.
The selection process took place in four waves and the new manager found 29 stations.
For the second time this year, we had to clean the hole.
All of it was released every time, creating almost the second river around the chalet.
Then we put Savo.
An incredible bull!
Our hole in the underground has always provided enough wonderful fragile water.
It was not done by any expert, the grandfather helped her.
For a long time.
It was just so on three routes and in general, as everything else in the house, but as I say.
The water was great.
until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we exhausted the water.
When she was there for several months, she deserved it.
But even then it seemed that the water didn’t smell.
I wondered if something didn’t fall.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible at a little bit of luck, there the plate was quite untouched, so the hole was tired with a piece of rope.
Our inspection confirmed that the steel was moving.
Otherwise there was nothing to see in the water, and that we lighted it up to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it out.
Of course, we have improved the improvised tasting around the pump tube.
We noticed strange things in the bedroom.
On the ground was a packed pack with some bones.
At least it looked like that.
And a bit further.
It looked like a blurred mouse.
At the roof, in the places where there are bronches, the grandfather's invention, there were the remains of fish!
And hard to go!
Our bedroom is also overwhelming.
Someone would say that the grandfather was simply undercovering the chateau.
It would not be so far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are only drowned sand, only the ceiling is undercovered.
There are mainly ships.
and the car.
and leaves on the beach.
The door with a wide gap was mostly open, as there in one piece someone walked.
On the roof there are some of the above mentioned.
Without a network, so the birds usually fly there and build a nest on the thresholds.
There is no need to mention the mice.
My grandfather wanted it to fly, and that again.
But the air didn’t help.
The whole store smelled.
We also cleaned the whole store.
Particularly the fish on the trail was nutritious!
We thrown out the things that were around: the plate, the heraclite plate, and so on.
Our house at a distance welcomed the passing disinfectant odor.
We wondered, who could get these bad things out there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
It would be hard to go to dinner.
My grandfather was attacked by a neighbor who was not in good condition.
Did he don’t give us the weaknesses there?
He’s here almost all year round, stupid ideas, that’s what he has.
We decided to watch and regularly check the floor.
After a few days everything was okay.
We started using water again, for now only for washing and washing before the tests are finished, but it was already good.
Throwing water from the forest hole is nothing I would like to do for some time.
Once we heard a terrible anxiety scream of our fena.
Mother looked out of the balcony and saw a long strong black hole in the grass next to the veranda.
Reza jumped over her and scratched like a crazy.
The mother made it out because she thought Réza had picked up a waste hole from the washing machine.
Suddenly, however, the hadice partially crushed into the club and partially crushed.
The balcony was shrinking.
He had a hysterical attack.
We ran down.
Užovka, long a lot over a meter and thick like a bear, was going to sweat an enormous rope and Réza prevented her from doing so.
It was unclear if she wanted to save the rubber or if she wanted to eat it alone, but it was irrelevant.
When the coat saw a transile in the form of our whole family, she probably said, let us eat it when we are such a coat, and elegantly stretched out with a bronze into the basement.
We were flying for her.
As a flash he jumped through the hole.
By the way, we recorded another smelling package on her board.
The smell of fish.
He was not there yesterday.
Our new security around the pump was a little shade.
We closed the store over the day.
That would...
We went out and there we all fell to one breath.
We didn’t wait long.
It shrinked the hole.
First, a flat head appeared with yellow moons on the neck.
Then the whole shell went out into the hole.
She wrapped around the pump and began to get into.
The kidnapped employee repented, bought a notebook and sold it.
The kidnapped employee after his release bought a computer on the company and then sold it.
The money was spent before the police arrested.
In a short time, the man bought in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
“Notebooks were taken to Olomouc, where they were sold by basars,” said Rostislav Brückner, Chief Commissioner of the Shumpers Police.
The motivation of the fraud was revenge to the employer for the release and also earning money.
“When he was interrogated, he claimed that he used the money to pay the loans,” Brückner said.
Police also found that the fraudulent is a pathological player who has repeatedly been treated at a psychiatrist.
Money could also end in winning instruments or video lottery terminals.
“The fact is that we didn’t find any money from him,” the commissioner said.
The deceiver, who has been sentenced for theft, is now threatened to be in prison for a period of one to five years.
Police have not yet stated whether there is a threat of punishment to the basars who bought and continued to sell laptops under the price.
“It’s true that they’ve taken up completely new goods, which is at least suspicious,” the commissioner said.
However, no one of the basar owners has yet been charged.
Come, a little more, you can do it or how I We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have made a number of changes.
The biggest was the route change, which brought the destination to the swimming pool, instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a little from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the stand where we photographed and filmed videos together.
To reach my view from the other side to perfection, I assumed the role of a personal guide.
Together with my friend Katya, we set up at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted friends who walked around us into the sector for faster runners.
There was no longer much time.
A couple of climbs for heating, activate sporttester, counting and start!
The screams of joy, but instead of a fast start followed the cupiting to the start line.
After five minutes, we get to the gate, switch the measurement and break at a rate of ten hours.
We’re plunging with the yellow serpent of runners who, like Katya, run their first race.
Until now they all look fresh, the slowly falling sun on the sky gives the view of Vyšehrad almost to a crazy breath.
The pulsing meat stretching around the coast looks like the whole Prague is running here.
On the coast between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre traditionally begins to demonstrate who has how many forces.
A light hole on Palackého Square forces many runners to slow down or go on to walk.
Just before the passage to the Theatre I see a police accompanying and immediately behind him the Vitek Pavlišta flies at an incredible pace to the destination.
I hear the admired breathing of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the trail, I encourage him, he’s going to climb with me, but just before that my foot will be swallowed and our hands will go closely.
Running the Theatre Street gives a chance for a short rest and breathing.
There are places in front of us where the views will breathe.
The turn on the Mánes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the sunset.
I don’t breathe and my feet carry me alone.
After the first time, the moment of truth comes.
During the passage of the road, Káťa scobrtne on the brick and shows a jump plavmo.
I see if he doesn’t need help, and I run a series of encouraging words so that he doesn’t have time to think about pain.
It runs up and continues with the Kozí uličkou, it is one of the closest places of the track, in this stage of the race there is no more such swelling, yet it is necessary to monitor the surroundings well.
I still don’t know that the concept of the closest place will gain its true meaning later.
We are frenetically encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to praise with anyone who offers a hand, and I advise it to Kat, because ten praises with fans are like half the energy stick.
It really works, we’re accelerating again, and although we’ve fallen quite significantly, now the fighter race has begun.
We are ahead of dozens of runners, when I go through someone especially tired, I try to encourage him with a few words: "Come, a little more, you can do it!"
There is no one going ahead of us, we’re accelerating.
So far we run for an hour and a quarter, we add, there’s nothing to wait.
Three kilometers to the goal will be painful, but it is really necessary to stick.
The sun is already slowly over and the end of the day symbolically slowly ends the race.
The last run on the bridge, the turn and just the line to the goal.
The pace we run is wondering where this girl is going?
“Let’s go down at 13 a.m., we’re going!” I call.
We try it, sprint it, and there is a goal.
Thirteen and six seconds.
What can be done.
The coach had a 20 hour limit.
Seven minutes under the plan.
That is a great result.
Just behind the goal, Katty's legs shrink, I help her to the barrier, where she rests for a while.
It is on it to see exhaustion, but also happiness from well performed performance.
I slowly get it out of the target space.
Euphoria doesn’t let us think of the button in the passages to the closet.
It is clear that the street was not the closest place.
This is just here behind the target of a shipwreck, which is under the attack of ten thousand runners pressed to break.
If someone doesn’t like the crowd, it’s not a place for him.
I also lose my head after a while and I wonder if those wonderful views and more interesting routes compared to the past years were worth what is happening in the destination.
From my own experience, I know that organizing a race is not a fun thing.
If 10,000 people are added, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire Prague centre for all transportation, it is a huge challenge.
This year’s route change showed the runners a lot of interesting places, but it also brought a few really unpleasant surprises.
Excellent atmosphere pumped in the Yellow Baths was transferred between the runner and in the race itself.
Organizers around the track and random viewers scored it on every meter of the track.
When the city runs through the historic center, unfortunately, there must be obstacles that cannot be removed, but the goal of a mass race in a place that is bound by the wall on the one hand and by the river on the other, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say the race ended with a goal, I assess it as a very successful one.
For the goal I had a little concern about the health of the participants, but in the end everything went well.
Write to us in the discussion if you liked the route and what you say about the situation in the destination.
Prison supervisors in Bulgaria protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria attended a national protest assembly in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands to reintroduce the original working conditions that have recently changed.
On the list of demands to be discussed with the provisional Minister of Justice Christos Ivanov, there are also higher wages.
The monitors symbolically protested against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour exchanges.
Although prison supervisors’ syndicates and the representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
“The negotiations are still ongoing,” said BNR’s head of the General Directorate of the Prison Service, Rosen Zhelyazkov.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Labour Organizations at the Ministry of the Interior will also join the protests of prison workers.
Why the universe may have more dimensions and we can’t see them
Physicists usually do not write bestsellers, but Brian Green of the Columbia University in 1999 managed to hit the black.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for the laics to penetrate the gap of problems that a number of theoretical physicists are dealing with today – an attempt to unite two greatly functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: the quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that in the case of searching for a unified physical theory it is not a boring story.
Physics’ basic problem between two key theories (for at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been solved and solved so imaginatively that it is worth telling the laics.
Greene also advised the complex material so fresh and attractive that he cannot be guilty of how much interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, he has mostly corrected his "feil" in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and The Hidden Reality.
Probably even the author would not object to the fact that his book would age faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything that an informed laic with the ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a little more alive in this area (for example because the LHC accelerator will eventually go on "full gas"), and so it is a good time to enter the Green's nonviolently open doors of the world of modern physics.
How big dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may surely sound foolish, fantastic, strange or mystical.
However, it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let’s turn our sight from the universe as a whole for a moment to something more ground, namely to a long and thin garden cage for floating.
Imagine that you stretch a hundred-meter garden cage from one side of the canyon to the other and watch the whole scenario from a half-kilometre distance (as on the picture and on the following page).
From such a distance you can easily notice a long, horizontally stretched hole, but if you don’t suffer from bystroscity, the thickness of the hole is hardly recognized.
Given its large distance from the hole you would think that the myrtle forced to live on the hole has only one dimension in which it can pass: the left-right dimension along the hole.
When someone asks you where the myrtle was at that moment, you will answer it with only one indication: the distance of the myrtle from the left (or right) end of the thread.
With all this we want to say only that from a half-kilometre distance a long piece of the thread looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the wheat has a thickness.
If we all enlarge, we will suddenly see the second dimension - in the shape of a circle swinging the serpent.
In such an enlarged perspective, it is clear that the myrtle can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension by the length of the wire, but also in the "dimensions in/in the direction of the movement of the clock hands", that is, around the circle of the wire.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small myrtle you need to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the wire and where the wire is on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the thread is two-dimensional (see. Experts will notice that this chapter is focused purely on the disturbance theory of the thread.
It is discussed in chapters 12 and 13.
The surface of the pipe is two-dimensional: one long long length dimension is displayed with a straight sheet, the dimension in the direction of the circle, marked with a circular sheet, is short and curved.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size along the thread is long and easily visible.
The size of the rotating circuit of the thread is short, "sweeped" and worse noticeable.
In order to realize the existence of the circular dimension, we had to explore the hadits with a significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates the important characteristic of space dimensions.
They are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, widespread, and therefore directly visible, or, on the contrary, small, swollen and much worse observable.
Of course, in the aforementioned case, we didn’t just predict to reveal the “svined” dimension of the thickness of the thread.
It was enough to take a telescope for help.
But if the pipe was thinner - like hair or capillary - the swollen dimension we would only reveal with great effort.
Kaluza sent in 1919 to Einstein his article, in which he arose with the amazing idea that space geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions we all know.
Kaluza justified his radical claim by the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein’s general relativity and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory can be traced into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Immediately, the question is how this Kaluz's perception goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer Kaluza silently predicted between the lines and clearly expressed and clarified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and curved dimensions.
This means that, like dimensions in the direction of the length of the thread, our universe also has three large, wide and easily visible dimensions, whose existence we realize at every moment.
But analogously with the circular circle of the garden hole, the universe may have even additional dimensions, firmly swallowed into the space so small that so far they have remained hidden even from our most perfect experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluz's remarkable proposal, let's stay a moment at the thread.
Imagine that on the circle of the hole we draw a relatively density of circles in a black color.
From the distance, the thread looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope now, thanks to the drawing, we will reveal the curved dimension even easier, we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We clearly see that the surface of the thread is two-dimensional, with one dimension big and almost unlimited and with the other short and round.
Kaluza and Klein came with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but in addition to one small circular dimension it has three large spatial dimensions, together thus four-spatial dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, let’s notice the illustration on Fig.3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
On the picture we enlarge the view of the geometry of the space similarly as we enlarged the surface of the thread.
Each subsequent level represents an enormous enlargement of space geometry from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of enlargement) if they are swallowed into a sufficiently small space; this explains that we have not observed them directly so far.
The square network depicts the commonly known "big" dimensions, while the circles a new, small and swollen dimension.
Just like the slices of the nit in a thick tapestone, these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - only we scattered them only into the crossroads in the square grid because of the viewability.
The background of Figure 4 depicts the commonly known space structure - the ordinary world around us - in such common scales as meters,visualized by the side of a small square in a square network.
On each following image, we will focus on a small area of the previous image; we will enlarge it so that it becomes visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see at the first few levels of enlargement.
However, when we move on our path to the microscopic properties of space geometry further - to the fourth level of enlargement in Figure 3 - we will suddenly see a new, in the shape of a circle swallowed dimension, similar to the slices of the niche in a thick tissue piece of the carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions similarly as the pipe has a circular circle in every point of its length.
For the purposes of viewing, the circular dimension has been scaled only in some, regularly placed points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluz and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry.
The similarity with the hat is obvious, although we also notice significant differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-range spatial dimensions (of which we have only drawn two), while the hadice has only one large dimensions.
The more important difference lies in the fact that we are now talking about the space geometry of the universe itself, not just about some object inside the universe, for example our hadice.
The basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular curved dimension is extremely miniature, recognizing it is - as well as the circular circuit of the wire - much harder than observing obvious, large and wide dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will actually be revealed above the strength of our most advanced tools to enlarge.
The most important thing, however, is that the additional dimension is not just a bull bump within the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration erroneously suggests.
A circular dimension is a new dimension that exists in each point of three common wide dimensions.
It is a dimension on the remaining three dimensions independent as are the dimensions up-to-down, left-right and front-to-back independent (and round) each other.
A sufficiently small mercury could move in all four dimensions and to determine its position we would need four data, in addition to three usual still position in a circular dimension; if we count the time, then the data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

You can buy the book The Elegant Universe of Brian Greeen here.
The price of the e-book is 149.
To our surprise, we find that even though we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluz and Klein’s considerations show that this does not exclude the existence of additional curved dimensions, if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with a simple eye.
How small should they be?
The most advanced technical equipment can recognize the structures of a billion billion meters.
We can hardly observe a smaller dimension.
In 1926, Klein combined the original Kaluz's idea with several ideas from the newly born quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that an additional circular dimension could have the size of approximately one Planck’s length, which is far beyond the differentiating capabilities of today’s instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions by Kaluz-Klein theory.
Honza Homola Advice How to Exercise on Electric Guitar: Part 5
The whole essence of the "twelve" consists in a twelve-tact harmonic form, which you can freely repeat.
Whoever tapes in the music theory, will find its principle detailed here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By educating a doll and a doll guide, whose Facebook profile can be followed here, he has lived as a graphic since his graduation twenty years ago.
He is a guitarist of the Wohnout band, from which he may not be able to leave.
The guitarist is after his father, as well as his brother Matthew, the leader of the Wohnout.
Start the training on one string.
"The rhythmic model is on you, you can invent anything, you just need to apply it to the harmonious model of the twelve," Honza advises.
When you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen and watch Honza, what can be invented with the twelfth harmony on two strings and how nice it begins to sound.
If you get the third string, you can already cocktail with the melody some songs.
When you finally add the fourth, be careful to change the layout, Honza warns in the video.
The next time Honza returns to the pentatonic and you’ll try to put it together with the twelve.
Exercise it honestly.
As best as possible, you will read it in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school game on electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting.
It’s not a big celebration, it recognizes the castle.
We take the point and we are happy for it.
The first half we had more chances we, the second home," the attacker said, which this time scored from the penalty.
Did you not be nervous when he played, but he was accompanied by a huge sand?
Somehow I didn’t notice it, although in the second goal, where the domestic fans are, it would probably be worse.
You got a penalty after half an hour, but you got a goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We slept the beginning, we were passive, the corner emerged from it, and after it the penalty.
After that you got up and in the first half you were a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after a break?
Difficult to say.
I agree that we played well until the break.
In the cabin we said we wanted to keep the pace of the game even after it, but we couldn’t.
To say the truth, I can’t even explain why.
But it is also true that the households said something to their game about the break, probably they were not very satisfied with it.
You’ve won the match for the first time, but at home you don’t have a goal yet.
Why is that difference?
I would not say that this is the difference, it depends on us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brna, but then it was bad from us, Plzeň, this is a different category.
Four matches you were waiting for a goal, did you not be afraid that it could be the same after the last match?
It may not be, but of course we are glad that we don’t have to listen to the talk of waiting for a goal from the last match.
Now we have added another without waiting, but there are still only three in six matches, which is still not for a big celebration.
Iceland - the lava flows from a kilometer away crater.
The lava flying to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier, flows through a subterranean tunnel from a kilometre away crater.
It is located under the ice, as well as a part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
The scientists are most concerned about this...
The situation remains unchanged for the moment.
From yesterday morning (31.8)
2014) still flew from the puppy approximately the same amount of lava.
Compared to the original estimates, however, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is 50x bigger.
However, scientists are concerned that the lava tunnel could open even in places where it is under the ice.
If this happened, in addition, with the same intensity as the current eruption shows, it would mean enormous floods, both on the Jökulsá á Fjöllum river and on other rivers.
In the surrounding area of the eruption, a strong odor of sulfur is felt, a cloud of steam and gases rises from the breaks.
This is definitely not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was in the case of the 2010 Fimmvörðuháls eruption.
This is much greater and there is also much more gases,” says volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved significantly since yesterday, and in the morning the area was almost windless.
The traces of the sand storm were dried with rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange degree (second highest) for Bárðarbungu and the yellow (third) for Askju.
Heaven above Cheb belonged to the courageous Lady Peggy.
She went through the wings.
Flight in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17, the aircraft acrobat Peggy Walentin was introduced, who during the flight went out of the cockpit to the hrazda on the top wing of the twist and also between the wings.
There it is referred only to the strength of the muscles.
The flight day in Cheb took place this year for the fifth time and the organizers again managed to prepare a few interesting flight pieces.
The premiere was held at the oldest Czech airport, not only "walking by the wings" by the German acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang or the Beechcraft 18 aircraft.
He turned his attention to himself with his brightness.
The acrobatics called Wingwalking originate in the United States.
After the First World War, many former war pilots were attempted.
Due to the number of deaths, it was prohibited.
Today, however, it is slowly returning to the program of air days.
Peggy will go out of the cockpit to the upper wing.
He performs various exercises.
At the end of the performance, it will move to the space between the wings of the aircraft, where its show continues," said Luděk Matějíček from the Chebsk Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If the performance of Peggy was the main hole of the program, then the next show of the Mustang fighter was a famous cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter crashed on the surface with the Grippeny of the Army of the Czech Republic in a curtain (the so-called numbers).
It was the first time that fans in the Czech Republic could see such a set.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavsky then showed everyone a breath-taking acrobatic with an aircraft from 1945.
It was made during the war, but probably never attended it.
It was included in the military reserves.
He has been working in the civil sector since 1963.
Like a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich.
On the same place there is also another Pearl of the Cheb Air Day, the two-motor Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, a powerful machine did not go to overlook.
His aligned aluminum coat shines to a distance.

Lucie Borhy: A dramatic return before the camera!
The parents' concerns were exchanged by Lucie Borhy at least for this evening for those working.
Stress or nervousness - a blonde moderator obviously doesn't know anything about it.
Moderating television news went well, as if she didn’t stop with him for two months at all!
It’s just two weeks since the blonde ended six months, when women experience the greatest stress after childbirth.
However, Lucie will not appear regularly in the main news session of TV Nova.
Regular return is expected, according to Blesk.cz, only in a month.
Her daughter, Linda, needs her more than the TV viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a hit in black.
Exhibition in Prague?
The house will be sold out, Planning a Goodbye
It would be worthy if something like that was done during the World Championship.
But it depends on how the union will stand to that," he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called the Golden Match, in which a spectacular Nana team met again.
Players who participated in the Golden Hattrick.
Players have a taste, right?
of course.
It would be good to say goodbye to the Golden Generation during the championship.
I think during the tournament they can find one or two days, when there is full vacation and where such a match can be mixed.
Let’s say that to Gum (Jiří Šlégrovi) or Béď Ščerban (the organizer of the Yugoslav match), who would take it on account...
The arena will be sold out.
But what if you’re playing with New Jersey play-off?
So when I come...
You don’t want to play in representation.
Or has Jihad’s meeting somehow changed your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and in representation there are decisive performances.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but performance is decisive, especially at the World Championship.
There should be riding players who have to do it, and not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you enjoy the Nana meeting?
The meeting with the players was great.
He has lived the stories and experienced a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for our fans, but also for our hockey players.
However, the most important thing was the honor of Ivan Hlink.
And it’s good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that one generation is leaving that’s really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the shift.
Are you preparing your first match?
Such things are not forgotten.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young people: I, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we entered in one trio.
This was the first representative start for everyone.
But that we dominate in some way, it cannot be said.
In Jihlava, after a long time, Dominik Hašek was captured.
What did you say about his performance?
I will never be surprised by the ice.
I wanted to return it to him with that criticism, but I can’t (Hashek criticized Jágra for the reasons why he decided to end in the representation).
The hunt also performed greatly.
He was going to train with me one night, and he was there.
Now he got famous.
First the U.S. and then the Netherlands, football players are starting qualifications.
A prominent guest arrived at the NH Hotel on Monday morning.
People could see the goalkeeper Peter Cech from Chelsea, the team coach Pavel Vrbu...
And here, that character in the black shell, that is Tomáš Rosický!
Arsenal's backpacker and captain arrived at the match around half a twelve between the last.
There is a great match against the Netherlands.
Who would not be happy?" he said when he appeared before the journalists in the representative set.
Czech representation program
Monday 1st September: the start of the strike, the first training
Tuesday 2 September: Open training for fans (18:30, Summer) Autogram (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday 9th September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of the collision
Rosicki and his fellow fans can support before Wednesday's match against the United States (20:15).
The representation for them opened Tuesday training, which starts at 18:30 on Summer.
And after it will be the autogram, which Rosický and Czech will not be missing.
Otherwise, the national team will be more calm.
That is the praise of the coach Vrba, who just complained about a lot of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
We will focus on the Netherlands.
It is a advantage if you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that have not been so long for so far,” Mr. Vrba, who officially leads the national team since January, said.
The Czech football team will be accompanied by a musketyric image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The team has three matches, all preparatory.
Norway and Finland scored 2:2 and Austria scored 1:2 against Finland.
However, these results were not important yet.
It only now.
The competition with the Netherlands will start with the qualifications for the 2016 European Championship.
The Czech team would, of course, help if he managed the general against the United States.
The first half of the year was to meet.
The results are important now.
We need to think about it to be successful,” Mr. Vrba agreed.
The only player in the twenty-three-member nomination who has health problems is the attacker David Lafata.
He is troubled by the temperature.
If he didn’t get healed to the Wednesday match against the U.S., the coach Vrba would call another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed.
A woman from Britain describes how she thought she would die after a bad diagnosis for many years.
After she was diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence believing she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was the Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spine.
The charitable organization CMT UK said that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
It is believed that approximately 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which can manifest symptoms in motorics such as muscle weakness, unmotionful walking and scratched fingers on the legs.
In the affected people, insensitivity or pain may also occur, this condition is untreatable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she suffered from Freidreich's ataxia (FA) - a disease that has a very bad forecast.
She believed that before she celebrated her eighteenth birthday, she would be hanged on a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children, who is now 51, says: “As a child I knew I couldn’t do the same things as the others.
Every day I fell down and everything took me longer.
I was never able to ride on wheels or on a skateboard with other children, and in school I was harassed because of how I was walking and running.”
When Rodgers was thirteen and was after several operations that had to release her Achill's shells and fix her legs, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room and looked into her documentation where she learned that she suffered FA.
“I felt guilty because I followed, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I returned home, I searched for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” she says.
When they answered me, I was shocked, I was completely paniced.
I thought that before I was eighteen, I would end up on a wheelchair, and before I was twenty-five, I would die, and in the meantime I would gradually lose all my abilities.
I was alone and I was planning a funeral.
When she was seventh, she realized that her walking ability did not worsen as much as she thought, and she asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her and said, “Zlatíko, I don’t think you’re sick, otherwise you’d be on a wheelchair.
I think it will be something much less dangerous to life.”
After several genetic tests it was found to have CMT.
“When he explained what CMT is, I thought I was a child lucky,” she said.
The CMT UK charity has launched a month of CMT awareness to alert the disease.
Entrepreneurs in the Washington region: with the turnover of the economy, taxes are rising
A growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
Also higher taxes.
According to a new survey, which was published last week, state and local corporate taxation in the country with accelerating recovery last year slightly increased and companies in Washington were not an exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia combined $27.6 billion to state and local treasures for the fiscal year 2013, a 3.8% higher amount than $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
Tax burden – both state and local – rose 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion compared to $3.9 percent last year and was the third year of growth in a row after 2009 and 2010, when taxes dropped.
According to a study conducted by the professional firm Ernst & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster, 4.3 percent, than local deductions, 3.9 percent.
More than half of the tax income of the district, 56% is from business tax, and 36% of the income of Maryland is from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, reports proportionally the lowest tax revenues from business.
Researchers say that the majority of tax income growth comes from the value increase of the property belonging to companies, which real estate tax increased this year after three consecutive years with growth of -1 per cent by 3.7 per cent.
Although most of the profits come from large states such as California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same situation is in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Vriginia paid over $10 billion on state and local real estate taxes last year, a 4.2% annual increase compared to $9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the obvious increase in the value of real estate is not so much to push up the state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate tax accounts for less than a fifth of the corporate taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C. the real estate tax accounts for almost half of the state and local taxation.
“In Maryland, many companies own real estate, especially the tax base around the D.C., the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay taxes,” explains Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more, for example, on income tax to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from business cannot be attributed only to the healing real estate market.
According to the data, the revenue from the business is also increasing.
Companies in the region have published $2.3 billion corporate income tax, which increased from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland on corporate income taxes took one billion dollars, most in the region.
Although they go in the same direction, the local tax burden of entrepreneurs does not grow in these three places as quickly.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average level, at 4.3%, while the growth rate in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia the tax increase was below the average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest income tax on business companies, 6% of all three districts (all of which have the same taxation).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, while the average D.C. remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the American Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and a generally more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. study did not evaluate.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law that reduces corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, just like Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state will continue to meet the income targets in the coming year, the law-defined income tax rate could be reduced to up to 3 percent in 2017.
According to a recent study, small entrepreneurs in Washington are doing better, and therefore they pay higher state and local taxes.
The living tax paid by small entrepreneurs as a personal income tax – the structure of compensation of cost increases by pricing, according to which the majority of companies are organized – in D.C., Maryland and Virginia increased last year by 20% to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and national increase in business tax will likely continue next year, with the total tax revenues from sales to state and local governments increasing to 6.2% compared to the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014.
Washington, however, may be behind others, because reducing government spending is choosing its tax on the labour market.
What you escaped: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorussia and Lafat's knife
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin calls for negotiations on Russia
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of the creation of a new state in the southeastern part of Ukraine, where government units have met with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, it will be difficult to return to the Russian market.
The support of the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine is contrary to democratic values.
The end of the conflict depends on Kiev, so it cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
Another sanctions against Russia?
The Czech Republic has the right to disagree.
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is expected to propose a form of further enforcement of anti-Russia sanctions within a week, the EU summit decided tonight.
This was stated by Herman Van Rompuy, the permanent chairman of the EU meetings.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, specific proposals to change the form of sanctions are to be prepared on Monday.
Tusk will be the new "president" of the EU.
Van Rompuye will be replaced in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the head of the European Council at the EU summit, the so-called EU president, who runs the summits of the Member States.
From December, he will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years.
Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini will be the leader of the European diplomacy.
The Italian, who will become the Vice-President of the European Commission, will still have to be approved by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, but it is not spoken about it.
To help an unhealable and long-term suffering patient with leaving life?
In the Czech conditions where the laws do not allow euthanasia, it is legally not possible.
However, the opinions of the doctors who addressed LN show that they are hearing of such requests.
ALS: The hardest chapter of neurology, says the doctor about sclerosis
About three hundred people in the Czech Republic suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 21 patients undergo experimental treatment with stem cells in Prague Motole.
We do not know 100% whether it will be successful.
But if we don’t try it, we won’t find out,” says Radim Mazanec, a motol neurologist.
It's in knowing the CIA manuscript, they needed war, Huml writes about the crash of the MH17 flight
The CSSD deputy Stanislav Huml is clear in who shot down the Malaysian aircraft over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "hard sanctions, which were declared in connection with the crash of a civilian plane with 300 dead, were intentionally caused by the Ukrainian army."
According to the lawmaker, it is also known by the CIA's manuscript.
Impossible promises.
Elections are approaching and the parties offer the impossible.
The end of the homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and the railway over Prague.
This is repeated before every election: the parties promise the impossible.
Also now, with the upcoming municipal elections, politicians are predicting who would like the voters more.
The server of Lidovky.cz has chosen unfulfillable promises from the present and past.
70 years ago, Czechoslovakia landed at Dunkerque.
Started a striking circumference
It was on August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak independent brigade moved to France.
Her commander Alois Liška continuously asked for supplementing technical equipment and shipping to the front.
The British party eventually agreed and included this ground unit as one of its forces in the circumvent of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German troops.
SOUHRN: Plzeň leads the league before the Prague "S", Liberec declassifies Minik
Viktoria Plzeň is the new leader of the football league, which leads a point ahead of both Prague "S".
Changes in the head of the table caused the defeat of Slavia 1:2 in Mladé Boleslav.
After two defeats in the home league Sparta recovered, thanks to two Lafat interventions, Jablonec defeated.

How to get back from vacation?
Do not rush and get to sleep.
The last days of vacation are ahead of us.
To get used after returning from the sunny beach or chalet to the normal work rate can be for many nuts.
It can even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are good tips on how to deal with the changed situation: don’t rush and give you a good quality sleep.
Family Joan Rivers: “We keep our fingers”
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was taken to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today she is not losing the hope that the eighty-year-old comedian will heal.
“Thank you for your greetings and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hold her fingers.
Her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the rescue service, according to which she had a heart attack at the Yorkwill endoscopy in Upper East Side, a source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of the sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains “serious.”
The reactions have not left long to wait, including the incredible support on the internet from personalities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is titled.
The fact that the media with their titles disrupts reality is (unfortunately) no news.
I know that the titles "sell" the newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
And that’s the fact that has been very troubling for me recently, more accurate is the word shade.
This is concerned with articles about the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The title is “Israel attacked Gaza.”
Only in the text you can read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the missiles launched from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
It will then appear the title "Both sides violated the ceasefire."
Does the journalist community realize that it is directly involved in the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
60 years have not passed since the end of World War II.
There are people who survived.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd cried the motto "Jewish pigs" and similar confidence, I was trembling.
Does the world want to finish what did not succeed Hitler?
Do our journalists realize the fact that after the Jews they were destined to destroy the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen journalists, please take a little more care of your work.
You are often referred to as “the dogs of democracy.”
So defend her.
As long as he is here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you want our government to be preserved if one of our neighbors decided that the Czech nation would be destroyed and the Czech Republic would be removed from the map of the world?
You may also have to realize another fact.
About 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the territory of Israel.
They are well there.
When you ask them why they don’t go among their own, for example to Gaza, they will answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel they have work, social security, and high-end health care (I have seen in my own eyes how to the high-end private hospital Hadassa, which is funded from the sponsorship gifts of Jews from all over the world, Arabs are usually going and they are obviously treated there).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers.
The only true help to Gaza, and thus to this unrestful area, is to get rid of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, even indirectly in the titles.
Inform about Hamas’ practices, about its abuse of people as human shields.
Please inform that Hamas aims to destroy the State of Israel at any cost.
The death of innocent Arab children.
Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Please note that in nine years of self-government in Gaza this area could be flourishing thanks to humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which the governors of Gaza do not pay and even are angry that the power supply is sometimes interrupted at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels to allow suicide attackers to penetrate the territory of Israel, but in the construction of houses, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would have lived significantly better.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.4 billion
Amazon just confirmed the statement on Monday morning: The Internet retailer – a video producer and hundreds of other things – purchases the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement caused a surprise not because no one would expect someone to buy Twitch, but because it was expected to be the buyer of YouTube.
Three months ago, the sales of Twitch to Google for a billion seemed secure, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded by Justin.tv just three years ago, had to become a widely used video streaming service – the live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online broadcasts of games to it - the words of Business Insider "YouTube for live streaming gaming".
The Twitch Interface.
On YouTube, there are already popular “Let’s play” videos, a kind where mudrlanti (mostly older) give games processing the Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube when describingTwitch comes to a lot of trouble, so the news that YouTube purchasesTwitch didn’t annoy anyone much, it was a tutorial example of how a established company will pay for a possible competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube failed, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
Twitch CEO Emmeta Sheara said: “We’ve chosen Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and a long-term vision and wants to help us meet it faster.”
Another mystery is - honestly - the incredible success of Twitch.
For snows like me who claim that sports are better doing than watching, it’s hard to understand what’s so amazing about playing games instead of actually playing just watching.
One thing is to watch at three in the morning a friend over the shoulder as he plays Resident Evil, and a completely different thing is to watch someone stranger as he gets twenty interventions into the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you can watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today’s most popular games are from the player’s perspective, so looking at their recording without being able to check the perspective by yourself is a pretty good recipe to get a canlav.
I admit that the speed run game, in which the Rogeers of our electronic time finish the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone is not a master of play or humor, his channel on Twitch probably won’t be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about that?
Twitch has 55 million visitors a month and is the fourth on top of internet traffic.
How does Amazon use this?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch is mixed into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it could be swallowed by YouTube.
But Twitch has something that every company wants to attract: the hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Twitche Shear’s director said, Amazon and Twitch “believe in the future of the games” and the media don’t seem to be distracted, neither as – swallowing – the audience.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of the American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the theme "The Holy Scriptures are God's Word."
The original video is attached.
The second basic lies of creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers discuss one of the many things that are contrary to their religion, they often ask us the question: Who will you believe?
The word of God or the word of man?
As if the human examination was entirely nonsense compared to the authority they imagine that their doctrine has.
But when they say “man”, they talk about science.
And when they refer to the "Word of God", they refer to the myths about God written by people.
If there really is an intelligent with the creator with any purpose, then it is he who created a fossil record that reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be he who added another series of evidence that show exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why would all these things exist?
It seems like he was trying to tell us something.
People could not create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabulate.
And they were the people who wrote all those texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by people, not gods.
People who were “mounted” or “inspired” by their favourite gods, or listened to the dictates of angels, but those texts were not written by anyone other than merely mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels and no gods at all.
If there really was one true god, he would be an integral part of all gods of all religions, the over-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the whole universe.
If a creature of such a size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only Holy Scriptures.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because human authors would not be able to measure with such a work.
And people shouldn’t have to believe it blindly, because it would be consistent, understood by proven and true evidence, and reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would constantly inspire every reader to the unity of common faith.
If God had written it, we’t expect anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions without a common origin, and all of them are constantly divided into increasingly separated denominations, seeking controversial truths, and each in some way claims the guidance of God, regardless of the continued divinity and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Tora, the Christian Gospel, the Islamic Qur’an, Bahá’u’lláh’s Kitáb-i-Akdás, Zarathuštra’s Avest, Sikh’s Adí-Granth, Mahabharat’s Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Book of Urantia are all considered as “absolute truth” and “the revealed word of the only true God” and the corresponding believers each of them say that the others are on the scest.
The only logical explanation is probably that, to a certain extent, everyone is on the scest.
None of the above-mentioned books have any advantage over the others.
None of them have evidence support and no one can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I am a professor of ancient history at the Western Michigan University.
I don’t say I’ve proven that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it is not.
You have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apology (defense), because they contain irregularities, absurdities and primitive concepts once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So it cannot be claimed that they are proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them are promoting wicked brutality instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy — with the fact that each can also contain a prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
The top theologists acknowledge that all the sacred texts of any religion have been written by human hands and therefore are subject to interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often binding political motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and irregularities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I would not call it contradictions, rather mutual comments.
We must again point out that here we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and definitely isn’t the story of an eye witness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentecost, i.e. five Books of "Moses" and Moses does not attribute authority to any of them, because it almost did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
The other documents were refiltered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as the believers think.
The Lights of the Dead Sea are the oldest archaeological discoveries of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monoteistic beliefs, and yet are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druidic cults, Chinese or Egyptian religions.
Christianity began as a gnostic faith, followed by docetists and ebionists, and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined into a kind of compromise called Orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups, such as luciferians, were divided and discredited by other Bible revisions.
One of these amendments relates to King Ugarita, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Because his followers represented a major threat to the young Mosaic religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to laugh, and Ba'al Zebula, "The Lord on the Mountain" changed to Belzebub, "The Lord of the Mouse."
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently modified for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened to the New Law was canonized in the 4th century BC in a series of commission decisions at the parliament in Nizhny Novgorod.
The four Gospels were accepted and the sixteen others were rejected by simply raising the hand, as if the fact of something could be accepted or rejected by voting.
The way the canon developed depends on what was read on Sunday in the Christian centers at that time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Church of Jerusalem?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually discovered that they were approaching the same evangelical stories.
And so the core of the canon developed from the earliest church.
So the Council simply accepted as the Gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at that time.
But they also consciously removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they referred to them books that were approved.
Among the rejected items we find the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should the word of God refer us to books that are just the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor?
The Bible often cites human authors.
But how could it be approved in this way if God was the real author of this random mixture of reputation, similarities and Psalmic lyrics?
The Bible was written by people and not too illuminated, rather the opposite!
That’s why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, regardless of almost anything from the beginning to the end.
We are talking about people who believed that serpents and bears can speak, believed in magic, bloody sacrifices, ritual magic, charming objects, fire lektvary, astrology, and five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magical strip to spray someone with blood, it will heal him from the lepra.
We’re talking about people who thought the rabbits were swallowers and the puppets were birds and the whales were fish and the puppets were the whole number.
These people believed that when they show a pregnant cow striped patterns, they would give birth to striped tells.
How can anyone know something about genetics?
The authors of this book did not know.
If the Bible was written by a higher being, it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would not contain anything of what it contains at all.
As a moral guide completely fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigot wilds who ignored or promoted cruelty against animals, incest, slavery, slavery abuse, family members abuse, child abuse, child violence, abortion, peeling, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudices against race, nation, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming that they do the will of God.
However, the creationists are ignoring all this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why?
For if the creationists had no loved books, they would have no God.
The one and the other are the same in the world.
It’s ironic that they reject God’s “work” as “the incitement of creation instead of the creator.”
But they themselves consider the word of man as the word of God and God himself, and even insist that the rejection of their alleged “happy” books somehow rejection of God as such.
Not the verses of God, but the verses of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God lies.
They cannot accept that God may exist and the Bible may be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate the doctrine from the divine.
So it is a kind of worship, where believers worship the compilations made by man, as if these books were God himself, because they think they are His Word.
But God has never written or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected in their allegedly “immutable word” of any god has been invented, compiled, gathered, translated, interpreted, modified, and often also deliberately modified and disrupted by merely misleading people.

A Chinese school attack killed nine people, three of them killed
A man named Chen, according to the New China agency, violently entered the elementary school building in the morning and attacked around half 11 local time.
Three of the nine people he killed later died in the hospital.
Chen later killed himself by jumping from the height, New China said with reference to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public therefore calls for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where many married couples, in accordance with government policy, have only one descendants.
Zeman showed the first students how he had to sit in school
The youngest schoolchildren were taken by the nine to their classroom, where she and her teacher were waiting for the presidential arrival.
He then showed the children how he had to sit alone in school.
“We had to sit with our hands behind our back, that’s not waiting for you, you’re already free people,” Zeman said to the children.
His wife then gave the first-year-olds as a gift.
President Miloš Zeman is in the first class of the Primary School in Lane.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek started a new school year at a private sports school in Lithuania.
“This year I want to connect more Czech education with Czech sport,” he approached one of the reasons why the first school day went to the north of the Czech Republic.
The head of the school recently addressed him at the hockey match in Lithuania.
“They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to participate at the beginning of the school year,” the minister added.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) started the school year at a private sports school in Lithuania.
This year there were 115,000 first classes.
More than 850,000 children will go to primary schools and more than 405,000 students will be educated in secondary schools, the Ministry of Education estimates.

Apple’s iCloud claimed to fall down to hackers, naked images of celebrity came to the public
Screenshot with the list of escaped files
Until now, an anonymous user on the 4chan server publishes naked and pornographic images of American celebrity, the U.S. server Mashable.com said.
They were allegedly obtained by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where affected users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not commented on the issue yet.
Some celebrity rejects the images as falsified, but the authenticity of the images has already been admitted.
Among them are actress Jennifer Lawrence known for the title role of Katniss in the Hunger Games series or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in the Death Fist 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the images and videos obtained to enrich.
According to news from 4chan, the hackers prefer money from the community.
According to The Next Web, it is very likely really a weakness in iCloud security.
On the GitHub server two days ago, a tool appeared that enabled you to obtain passwords to user accounts through gross power, i.e. automatically repeating attempts to log in with different passwords.
The tool proved to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had a lot of time to get access to different accounts before publishing this tool.
Thus, iCloud users should change their password associated with Apple ID for preventive reasons.
The importance is the length of the password, not its complexity.
The length is at least 12 characters.
The escape of naked images celebrity considers a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are secure many times better than household computers or smaller, the upload of sensitive photos in unprotected form is unnecessary risk.
If you want to backup explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, first encrypt the files before uploading.
It is also reasonable to set the automatic backup of photos from the phone so that it only takes place on the Wi-Fi and after connecting to the charger.
So you’ll have the opportunity in time sensitive images to move “to safe”, and most importantly you’ll have the space to delete unleashed images, so they won’t unnecessarily occupy space in the online storage.
Guidelines on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer readers HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altaira Valáška in PDF format.
Smart ways to save for a college script
Since the price for a college script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the upcoming second-year student came with a smart way to reduce costs.
He invented a book lease system from high school fellow students with a nominal compensation offer to delay their re-sales.
“A book on calculations, which usually costs $180, I got for ten and for chicken nugets per semester,” says Schroeder, 19, who studies at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
I lost 120.
According to the University Council, an average student will spend more than $1,200 a year on books and utilities, but students have different options to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students becomes online stores and creative solutions like Schroeder.
On the rise is the lease of books, which allows students to use a semester book and often with a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 bookstores in campus, says the book lease has doubled since 2011.
A survey in the industry shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of teaching texts are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Businesses.
Here are the 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower on the internet than in a university bookstore.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edward and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but on the internet it is possible to buy a new one at Chegg.com, a retail store specializing in books, for $239.99.
Buy Used
If you don’t care about the notes of other people or the usage and destruction, the appropriate option is the use of teaching texts.
On Chegg.com, “Calculus” is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for the print “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” used.
The new was sold for $48.
University teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls suggests that students with their teachers verify whether older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes in workshops are not significant.
If so, older versions can be sold for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, the popular alternative to buying used books are also eBay Inc's Half.com.
Loan
It is also worth considering to borrow books, if you treat them well, don’t forget to return them and don’t need to have them even after the seminar ends.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow “Calculus” for about $20 for the entire semester.
Find out the terms of the store in which you borrow the book, including a penalty for notes, highlight or usage and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the penalty may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to make an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrowed “Calculus” for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, the most affordable offers can be found by students of literary courses, as many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
Go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon enter the Pepperdine Law School, recommends that you follow the ISBN because it guarantees that you’re buying the right book.
Before you order the book via the internet, make sure it’s really a warehouse, Gault advises.
He convinced himself on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for the book from a university bookstore.
The Bahno, the Bahno.
And then they found in the torzo hole gun from the end of the war.
It stands a little away from the church of St. George.
We discovered a porost around and we began to pull out a flying nános - about a meters and a half of a shell and shelled leaves.
“When we approached the yellow bottom, we met the head,” Radomil Novák said.
We pulled it out, cleansed it and found that it was a torzo-attacking German gun that was used by the SS units.
The find is allegedly unusual.
According to my information, such weapons were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand,” Novak added.
All of the wooden structural things have been broken down over time, therefore it is unusable.
Their body, however, is preserved – it keeps its shape.
How was it in the hole?
There is one explanation.
Per it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the SS units, probably because of the fear of not being dismissed.
The fascists in the escape would probably not do that.
They threw the weapons in the forest,” the finders think.
The gun was the only thing the enthusiasts of the Autumn Spirit Movement found in the hole.
“There could also be hand grenades, those once there was a lot around, so we slowed the mining work, we carefully broke the shell so that there was no misfortune, but nothing else there was not,” Novák said.
The discovery will end in the museum depositary in a castle in the nearby Silesian Rudoltics.
Ukrainian general: I haven’t released the captured Czech
Exclusive interview with Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Sorry, I have to take it ... they call me from Donetsk," apologized eight times during an exclusive interview with the Ukrainian Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also the director of the Center for the Liberation of War Prisoners there.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in a television debate.
At each such interruption it was not possible not to hear the names of people, their numbers or the places where they are – or should be – that Ruban clarifies with his counterpart on the other end of the phone.
"It will be that - go there," he ended one of the flash discussions with Donetsk and again dedicated to our.
Volodymyr Ruban is a backup general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in the anti-government protests in Majdan.
Even yesterday - when we agreed to the conversation - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the prison of pro-Russian separatists is dedicated 24 hours a day.
You may know that the Czechs are fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number to thirty.
However, there can be much more of them.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have released the prisoners of the Serbs, the Dagestan, the Chechen, one Swedish, the Georgian... but the Czechs have not yet been released.
But I know to whom to turn in Prague if we could encounter your prisoner and release him.
Ukrainian soldier detained by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian soldiers take them?
They should understand that if the Czechs fight in Ukrainian volunteers and separatists take them, then they will be shot without grace after interrogation, like any other stranger.
Separatists consider these men to be rent payers and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers take a group of Donetsk separatists – and among them a Czech – they put him in prison and act with him as a prisoner of war.
That man will survive.
The Ukrainian party also acts as a state in the war.
A.K.: And how many of you have already managed to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand it, I am in exchange.
Some sources say that it has already exceeded a hundred men.
We have stopped counting how many people we have helped.
We only liberated them... they didn’t save them before the war if they decided to continue the battle.
The rescuers are in the war doctors, surgeons, but we definitely don’t.
So is it.
And every day there are more and more.
Every day we save someone.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
It is not always about exchange.
Sometimes a human request is enough to release the prisoners.
A.cz: It is heard that in a few months you have gained great authority and even confidence among the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in the Ukrainian society.
How did you build respect for both parties?
A difficult question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the surname “the crazy general with steel balls.”
It doesn’t hurt me.
And that may also highlight the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Officers' Corps, I have gained some authority before.
I’m never fooling, I’m never fooling, I’m always holding a word.
Whatever happens, I act honestly and speak the truth.
Even when it is very unpleasant to the Ukrainian government, or to the Donetsk or Luhansk.
They torture and kill people.
They say they are tortured and murdered.
And that they are crimes.
Often I risk my life, even I’m caught in the exchange of prisoners... This work can mean the end to me at any time... I don’t have to go back.
Q: How many people are killed and killed?
Ukrainians and separatists are seeking to torture prisoners.
Unfortunately .
And the execution?
It is only on the Donetsk side.
I have no information about the fact that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
There is no indication that the Ukrainian army is doing something similar.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I can’t and I don’t want to indicate the numbers.
A.cz: Describe to me the character and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are seeking independence and democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk – that’s at least what they say.
They no longer want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
Separatists already have oligarchs full of teeth and are their untrue opponents – to life and to death.
As we say, they went through to their throat.
The same dreams and desires were revealed in Majdan.
And now I speculate a little: Russia supports separatists and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
One speculation is big and the other small.
But this phrase hides in itself an immeasurable contradiction.
A.cz: What do you think, for example, of one of the hardest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Whenever I cross the line of the war front, I am without weapons and I show troops or armed forces broken holy hands.
And I always have both sides of those two hundred or three hundred meters on the mouse or in the optical focus.
I see the faces of the people who are targeting me every time... and they can at any time push the launch of their weapons.
He is an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, then just like a small governor in the great Russian Empire.
In any case, they are constantly talking about it and consider Ukraine a sort of misunderstanding.
Such a state should not exist.
He is the unbeatable enemy of all the Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: When we’re talking about characters – in the discussion show of the Ukrainian television, you described your Prime Minister Arseniya Jaceňuk as a weak, unhelpful and tired “leader” who would do the best if he would quickly leave.
At three hundred meters, I always get at least five times the fear.
So why should I be hidden with the opinion that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that it is harmful to our country?
Q: Do you think that there is a part of the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians call Jaceňuka a “coon.”
And the rabbit is not in the eyes of the Ukrainians an animal from which fear or respect and authority would go.
His behavior directly copies the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister he has no right in war to cry in the parliament, to ask him, to play with him his intrics, to threaten him to put his office... he must govern the country, manage it, and in time of war protect it.
When the country is threatened, the prime minister has no right to family, friends, rest on crying emotions.
He is the first Minister of Ukraine.
What about Jace?
She behaves like a puberty girl.
Yes, he’s tired, but he’s also weak, because he’s never strong... he’s not fighting for Ukraine, he’s only constantly complaining about everything.
He should therefore leave.
The earlier, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Didn't Save Sales
The missing 3 of Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from the US's $90 million budget and Sin City: The Woman I'd Kill returned only $12 million from the $70 million budget.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz during the first weekend earned only $14.6 million and also children's movies like How to Train the Dragon 2 were a disappointment for the cinema.
According to the article of film critic Robbie Collin in Telegraph, what matters to children’s films is the fault of their own quality.
Collin described 2014 as the “badest” year of children’s films, and How to Train the Dragon 2 called it a “functional” continuation.
When it comes to films placed on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem necessarily doesn’t have to be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average summer film premiere ratings broadcast in at least 2,000 cinemas during the period between War Victims Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, taking into account the opinion of both viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film harvest is similar to last year’s hits.
According to some commentators, the fault may be the change in viewers’ access and the increased popularity of Internet servers like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's Jungle Book processing, said on the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times are changing."
We must admit it and do not try to pursue what has already been.
Unlike the current crisis of Hollywood's cash brokers, Netflix's profits through internet services reached $1.2 billion, which is twice as much as last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for too much relying on the rights to comics, and predicted the “rise” of Hollywood.
In the light of the current fall, some commentators claim that something may be on his catastrophic news.
With the introduction of possible big cash crackers in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Foreigners and the Jurassic World, other figures are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in sales as simply “cyclic.”The Hollywood Reporter said: “The next summer will be the summer of the biggest cash breakers in history and no one will worry about sales.”
North Korea threatens Seoul, another short-distance missile has been launched
North Korea has launched another short-distance missile into the sea, Soul said.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the end of the joint military maneuver by the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as preparation for an invasion.
Changang Province is located in the northwest of the KDLR at the border with China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Ministry of Defense said the missiles were launched from a place in northwestern North Korea and reached a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea was the first to launch a missile from the Chagang province, the South Korean media said with reference to military circles.
In the province there is a subterranean launch ramp for Scud-type missiles.
This is another of a series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has carried out in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusual number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, protests took place at the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to participate in the anti-NATO march.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to the council in Cardiff for a meeting, which was described as a counter-top.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation during the weekend and spoke with the protesters who arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be transported from Blue Mountains
Two young tourists were picked up by a plane and transported to safety after they spent a night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
The sixteen-year-old girl and the eighteen-year-old man went on a tour to Govetts Leap in Blackheath on Sunday afternoon.
When they didn’t return home, concerned relatives called the police around eight in the evening.
A police and a rescue team were sent and the couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11 a.m.
The girl wounded her knee and the man fell and hit himself in the head.
The police stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
They were transported to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
He brought only a point, the victory was on his foot.
The 23-year-old forvard was able to decide, but in two greatest chances he failed.
After the goal called mainly the shot close three minutes before the end, but ended on the goalkeeper Opava Josef Květoň.
I had it on my feet, I have to give it a chance.
“I’m angry on myself,” he sinked the sand on his head.
“Maybe I had to put it up under the cover, a little bit of it came to me,” he thought.
Sigma's defense did not allow Opava much, with the exception Mikul's 11-minute attack, which, however, covered the goalman Reichl.
Then they began to push the Hanats, but they were not allowed in the block of the domestic defense, and the missiles from a distance were captured by Květoň.
We compare for 15 minutes, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But the outstanding chance was not changed by Vašíček, and so it ended 0-0," the coach of Hanák Leoš Kalvodu regretted.
Opava took the point because of the absences in the composition, where in addition to the two injured missed also Petr Vavřík with the three-gol shooter Peter Shevčík, who in Silesia host from Sigma.
Unlike their previous policies, they did not make it possible.
Deputies deserve an abolition.
Sigma worked more football, but unless one standard we didn’t let it go to anything,” said Slezan’s coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggressiveness and combat.
Remise is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma has reached four points, which means the 13th place.
Nothing could satisfy the club boss Josef Lébra, who after defeat with Znojm conditioned his million deposit in the cash with diametrally different performance in the next matches.
"We realized the warning of Mr. Lébra, so it can't be a talk about the guys don't want to fight," Kalvoda noticed and added to the address of the sleeping shooter Vašíčka: "I believe it will come and when he gives a goal, he will begin to fall there.
But after the first hit, I will replace him immediately, so that he will save his goals for the next matches," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has twice struck Venice.
Film Festival is in crisis.
After an enormous enthusiasm over the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritu was ranked among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, other days showed the impression that the interest in the 71st anniversary of the festival in Venice slightly declined.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen hundred, or because after Birdman followed critics recognized but less attractive images for the viewers as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s With a look of silence and other social-themed movies from the American 99 homes to the Iranian Stories, the cinemas simply remained empty seats.
Heroes of Comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not been occupied by the crowds as in the past, and it is said that it has ceased to be a problem to get a place at the last moment in the hotel.
The crisis is speaking more than elsewhere in Italy and it is no wonder that it has affected even so valued institutions like the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not manifested by a lack of personalities, but present exclusively in connection with films.
While younger fans wished for autographs of representatives of comic superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who successfully played dramatic roles in 99 houses, for all generations without a difference, the main event was the visit of legendary actor Ala Pacin.
He appeared here in two films.
In the Story of the Disclosure Out of the Competition, filmed by Oscar Barry Levison according to Philip Roth's novel, the seventy-year-old Pacino has a role that is close to him: an actor at the peak of glory, suffering from depression from the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the next day as a strange iron farm owner from a rural town in the film Manglehorn, filmed by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for the best acting performance should not be missed - but does the artist of the Pacin format still need awards?
Per the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and that of the Italian especially, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country from which his grandparents come.
Points for Italy
This year the Italian film is going very well in Venice.
The Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first film after Birdman rewarded with a long compliment of the rise.
Calabria's mafia foot is seen in it with a look at the family relationships between the klanes who struggle for power and money, and the director was able to match all the prerequisites for a good film: quality scenario, camera, music and actor.
He was also interested in the camera psychothriller Hunger Heart, filmed by Saverio Costanzo and Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who by her scestly anxiety will almost destroy her own child.
On the contrary, from the French competitive films there was no warm acceptance, neither the Rescue for Glory, nor three hearts, both of the works cheating on the traditional model of consumer films, which rely on the popularity of acting representatives.
But after all, two really excellent movies, namely Birdman and Black Souls, are not so few in the first half of the festival.
And although the festival images have all depressive subjects, Peter Bogdanovich’s new film She’s Funny That Way, a funny comedy released in Venice out of competition and filmed in the style of the American joke games of the 40s, managed to raise the mood for more than one day.
Police arrest four pervitine manufacturers in Prague, drugs were carried from Poland
“The detectives have arrested three men aged 42, 42 and 37 years and a twenty-five-year-old woman who from November last year to August this year manufactured and sold the drug pervitin in Prague 9 in the past days,” police spokeswoman Jana Rössler said.
First on Tuesday, 12 August, the intervention unit in the Cihlarsk Street captured a 42-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman, who in the group appeared as a drug buyer in Poland and a donation dealer.
The following day the detectives arrested, on the basis of the previous consent of the prosecutor, another member of the group, a 37-year-old man.
The last of the four police were arrested on Wednesday morning on August 20 in the area of the Maleshic combustion station," the spokesman said.
A woman receives one-third of drugs from Poland
The organizer had a wide field of activity.
In the workshop of the airport, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Konevov Street and in other places in Prague 9, he produced pervitin, supplied the various utilities and chemicals needed to produce it, and provided the transport of drugs with pseudoefedrin from the Republic of Poland.
He weighs the drug, divides it into plastic bags and then sells pervitin.
With the transport of drugs from Poland or the sale to drug addicts, he was helped by a twenty-five-year-old woman, which has not yet been punished.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rössler added.
Criminals, on the basis of the judge's order, also conducted several home inspections, where they secure the drug, industrial chemicals, digital weights, salary bags, injection sprayers, serpents and other utilities and objects that can be considered, according to expertise, a complete equipment for the production of metamfetamine.
The dealer has been punished seven times since 1995.
"From the available records the police found that the main organizer has been sentenced seven times since 1995 for property crime, the woman was not sentenced," the police spokesman added.
The latter detained was condemned in 2006 for a crime of sexual abuse and the 37-year-old car mechanic, who is prosecuted for freedom, has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
This was mainly a property crime.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing the crime of illegal production and other handling of narcotic and psychotropic substances and poison, threatening them to up to ten years in prison.
In the case of three persons, the investigator eventually submitted an initiative to the prosecutor's request for the arrest, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokesman said.
The fourth accused, a 37-year-old recidivist, was released.
His position and role in this case was not as crucial as with the other accused.
Police continue to work with this man.
Ferrari offers chess from wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers in its other products very interesting things at a lot of “interesting” prices.
A good example will be handmade chess in Italy with a playboard of 42 x 42 cm.
If you like it, get more than 40,000.
The exact price is 43,405.
The customer will get a set of black and red-lacked wood figures stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fiber.
Per no one will be surprised that instead of a classic rider, players have a figure of a rising horse.
If the chess doesn’t seem to be a sufficiently valuable gift, there’s also a Ferrari 500 F2 manufactured (of course hand) in the scale of 1:1,8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
The interruption of high schools and high schools has no meaning.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people and statistics further show that high school students have good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There has been a lot of training in the schools over the last 14 days.
Mostly, it is about routine matters, such as transferring flowers from the summer storage back to classes and nafasing crops.
At the gorgeous high school they will have a little greater frmol.
A few days before the start of the season, they are searching for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature into the library.
There was no robbery or fraud, the four-year gymnasium in Hořice after three years opens and renews its activity.
Not on the public, but on the private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not caused by the founder being so incapable.
They had to wait for whether the existence of the school will be confirmed by entering the register of schools managed by the MŠMT.
“French socialists should climb and put France in order,” said key ally Francois Hollande.
Valls calls on the strongly divided left to “show its support” to the battle-made socialist president whose new division of functions did not meet the majority of the French.
The President deserves universal respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
“Our duty is to stay on his side,” he said and gathered a praise.
As a peaceful gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not challenge the controversial French thirty-five-hour working week despite the passionate arguments by Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who on the beginning of the week proposed to release the rules.
On Saturday, Hollande called on the socialists to remain “coherent” with the government.
But Justice Minister Christiane Taubir made him a line over the budget when she appeared at the rebellious socialist parliamentary meeting, where she criticized the Socialist Party for the fact that “the French lost their faith in the future.”
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extreme conservative right, laughed at the constant internal disputes among socialists when she stated that she did not expect the new Valls government to last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls too.They were forced to form a new government when the previous government did not last until the end of the summer.
“And the new will not last until the end of autumn or winter,” Le Pen told his fans.
She repeated the call of her party to dissolve the Parliament and stated that she is convinced that it could win early elections and that she is ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections, and in May, the extreme conservative right man succeeded in the European Parliament elections.
According to a public opinion survey by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think the Socialist Party is at risk of dividing itself into several rival factions before Holland’s term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon be patient if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
“It’s a limited space for opportunity, but the public must think that there’s a change in the situation,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer limit Prague to elections
The amendments to the relevant regulations should be prepared and approved by the new headquarters of the capital.
The streets of Prague will not disappear before the municipal elections, and the city will not limit street art.
Dog marriage will not be restricted.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve the amendments to the relevant regulations in the parliament until October elections.
"In addition, the decision on the changes should not be made by the current city leadership, which will end its mandate in a few weeks," said mayor Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Cancelling platform gambling on its territory has been decided in recent weeks by several municipalities, such as Prague 5 and 7.
But the game will not disappear, the gambling regulations will not change yet.
This is the task of the new government after the election.
Now we would not get it technically, for example, due to the deadlines for commenting and so on,” Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current parliament, which must approve the amendment, will take place on September 11.
The referendum on the plain prohibition of gambling is scheduled on the day of municipal elections in the city parts of Prague 1 and Prague 8.
Currently, gambling is prohibited, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
This Regulation shall not be amended for the same reasons even in the case of street art, the so-called busking.
Prague 1, which has already sent to the magistrate a proposal of places, would like to extend the current list of prohibited places.
The musicians do not want Prague 5 in the surrounding area of Angel.
The law regulating the marriage of dogs is scheduled for several months, yet it is not completed.
The location of the games and the problem of busking is addressed by the city regulations.
It can only be issued or modified by the City Council.
The councils have only advisory votes, they do not issue decrees themselves.
Last week, the victory was placed on the hand of the Scottish independence proponents.
The campaign for Scottish independence was at risk of making this mistake for the third time when it almost placed on the billboards throughout Scotland the question whether the Scots want to be rich.
But you won’t get to the hearts of Scottish voters by applying to their wallet, nor won’t get their respect when you start threatening them.
The morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to the church today.
Scots are much more likely to expel exchangers from the temple than to let them dictate how to vote.
The head of the Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and therefore he repeatedly asked his rival, the unionist Darling, whether he is willing to respect "the sovereign will of the Scottish people" if the Scottish voters voted for independence, and to start supporting the single currency for Scotland and for England.
This forced Darling to vote between the Scottish civil society and the London finance, and with grimas fell into this trap.
Of course, Darling will not support the mandate of the Scottish voters.
However, the discussion about the currency that Scotland will have has already been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, employment opportunities and the defense of public health care that citizens have for free.
Darling in monetary matters supported London bankers and also caused the impression that he would not protest against the privatization of healthcare.
As Salmond said, “He went to bed with the conservatives.”
This is a very dangerous situation for every Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to the voters, but to the association of "boss", to the Confederation of British Industry.
It begins to be clear that Cameron’s refusal to discuss independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the unionist campaign.
Cameron so looks like a scary absent home.
The Scots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron at least managed to say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country."
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it makes him almost physical pain.
What he tells is clear: Scots should not jump out and have to accept what they are.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic start of school by Miloš Urban
Illustration of the Longest Year
Miloš Urban The Longest Year
The end was the best of the holidays at all, the last week that was no longer anywhere and we just swallowed and swallowed with the baby summer, the silence before the storm, the calm before the stress.
New clothes, when it was possible to get from Tuzex, shoes from Eastern Germany.
Reading the Fast Ships, already the fifth, cycling the mountain around the Imperial to the back behind Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, it was no longer hot, the sun glowed the back and shoulders, the rays climbed to the goodbye.
Evening mild nervousness, still still a vacation regime, sleeping until half the eleven, in a week will be worse, the moments before sleeping extend from a few minutes to two hours, in the morning then wake up at half the seventh.
Monday will come.
Mostly it doesn’t rain, on the contrary, the summer is misleading before school.
To serve yourself in the ghost light on the plate and feel like a plastic figure in a glass wheat, there is the school, ZDŠ A.
Zápotockého with a monstrously pink omítka, and before it old known faces and a couple of new, boys closer, girls brighter.
They’re grassy, they’re avoiding, it’s also interesting how unmistakably they keep together and how they’re here early.
And these adult-looking girls, who have come to scream, are now laughing hysterically to something, something has changed in their lives over the holidays, while with me everything is old.
And again the new beginners, some nervous and other enthusiasm, why do they go here at all?
Because it must, education war obligatory.
So therefore inside, the cold moisture of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned schoolchild with a mop, unfortunately still the same, which is said to borrow the student the keys from the sheet box, where they can leave the textbooks and which are still so few.
for a bottle.
The smell of the dress remains in memory, now it does not happen, it is well ventilated, but in a week it will be worse.
It is just from that idea that the stomach turns up and the head begins to hurt.
A head that even worse understands the lesson of mathematics, that devil game for the elected, among which I am not and will never be.
Again those three and four, the God of the Five, to hide from the trial, to fall into the labyrinth and best to sublimate, to be there and not to be, to exist only as a name in the classroom and to dream yet stories about more loving girls and beautiful buildings, about antennas into the universe, where no one competes with no one, no one is humiliated and no one's foot is drawn.
The longest year is ten months.
It’s just the first day, now as years ago.
The daughter was born to die.
It is in danger of an extraordinary punishment.
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the cabin of public toilets at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without a foreign help, she was born a little girl, which she packed in a ready cover, hid under a jacket, and took it to the road carrier, where she placed it in the trees located a few dozen meters from the road.
He was born on the way to school.
It came to me a little earlier.
I was on the way to school.
In the bus I had to go to the toilet, there I was born.
She was born alive and looked at me.
I cut off the puppy thread with the knives I was wearing to school," the accused said and said she was ashamed for pregnancy.
“The next day she returned to the place, put the baby’s body in the bag and took it out, removed the body from the bag, packed it into a black igelit bag and hid and left it under the stairs in her grandmother’s house in Havlíčkovo Brodá,” the prosecution states with the fact that it is not quite clear when the newborn died.
It could be in dozens of minutes, but even a few hours after the birth, drowning when covered with a deck or when placed under a jacket, cooling or bleeding from the unbounded puppy.
A similar scenario was repeated next year in the spring.
The woman in a closer uncovered time from February to April 12, when the body of the child was found by random witnesses under a cave at the river in Havlíčkobrodsk, again secretly gave birth.
This time in the bathroom of the underground apartment in the family house.
Without checking whether she was born alive, without cutting and binding the puppy that was rounded around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic packages including an igelit bag and left it in the bathroom.
In the afternoon, he and his partner were taken to the bar.
Finally, a friend gave her.
The father of the two children was the friend of the accused, who did not know about the pregnancy of the partner.
For this reason, he is not now in court, he was only punished for a crime against the funeral law.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don’t like it to be punished as a co-vinny.
I manipulated my child against my desire.
I know that my solution wasn’t correct, but it came to me at that moment as human,” the accused did not hide the anger, who allegedly was subject to the man’s relationship and feared him.
During his discourse, the young woman spoke quite balanced.
The tears went into her eyes until the moment she talked about her relationship with her parents, from whom she left after achieving full age.
She did not want to kill.
“They go for me every 14 days to visit, they do everything for me, even though I know I don’t deserve it,” she said.
I didn’t make my equipment because I didn’t want kids, I felt young.
Furt I wanted to put him in the baby box but I don't know what happened that I didn't do so.
I can’t explain it to you,” the judge answered.
But she refused to act with thought and intention to kill a newborn.
The second child was said to have been born dead.
During pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
I have limited it.
Not drunk hard.
I also smoked,” she said.
Although her pregnancy was seen in both cases, she claimed to everyone and on repeated questions that she had health problems, that she was swallowed.
And the friend too.
The main trial will continue on Tuesday at the Court of Justice with the statements of judicial experts.
A judgment may be issued on Wednesday.
A woman is threatened by a criminal rate of up to 18 years in prison or an exceptional punishment.
Norwegian Cruise is approaching $3 billion purchase of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the whole matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O), the third-largest ship travel operator in the world, has progressed in negotiations on the purchase of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion competing with the larger competition of Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), has made it possible to access the luxury Prestige Cruises cruises and rich customers.
The agreement may be published this week, a source said on Sunday, but noted that the negotiations may still not be successful.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a twenty-percent share in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want to be named because the negotiations are not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the request for a comment, the spokesman of Apollo refused to comment on the situation.
Norwegian Cruise, headquartered in Miami, operates thirteen cruise ships on ships in North America, the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company’s revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships flying to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
In 2013, the company announced sales of $1.2 billion, 6% more than in the previous year.
It is expected that the twenty-nine-billion segment of tour travel will benefit from the rise of the middle class in growing economies such as China and India in the coming year.
Companies are competing to make these customers a preferred option when choosing travel trips.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public offer at the U.S. regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has a majority share in the company since its closure in 2007 worth $850 million.

Pro-Democratic activists in Hong Kong day after the vote provoke Chinese authorities
A group of people who were loyal to Beijing were standing near the Chinese flag.
The National People's Congress' permanent committee on Sunday approved that only two out of three candidates will participate in the 2017 Hong Kong elections.
All candidates must first receive the support of the nomination committee, which will likely consist of loyal members to Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get to the voting cards and to force pro-democratic activists to restore the promise and shake Hong Kong’s financial center by the protest of the “Central Occupation” movement.
In Hong Kong, the political reform is the main reason for tensions, and Chinese leaders are concerned that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report on China’s official power in Hong Kong in June, Democratic activists held an informal referendum on the election in a special official district and hundreds of thousands of people entered the city’s trade district and occupied it.
The press conference, which will be held by Prime Minister Li, is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Contact Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the Vice-President of the Permanent Committee of the Legislative Commission, Zhang Ronghsun, and the Vice-Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Feng Wei, were to speak at several press conferences.
Study activists said they will gather in the afternoon in front of the government's office in Hong Kong.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin calls on Kiev to start negotiations on “state sovereignty” with eastern Ukraine
According to the description of the events by the Russian newspapers on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop the struggles with separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the “state sovereignty” of the separated areas.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin with his note did not intend to indicate that the regions of eastern Ukraine under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be re-evaluated so that the Russian-speaking region gets authority to protect its rights and interests.
Putin’s call to the Kiev government to deal with the pro-Russian rebels as equal to itself is in line with the obvious strategy that has been followed since the outbreak of the five months ago: Help the separatists to occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorussia the actual independence, so that it can join Russia instead of the West.
In an interview for the first state television channel, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to regain the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which in March and April were controlled by separatists after Moscow on March 18 annexed the Crimea Peninsula belonging to Ukraine.
The Kremlin and separatists called the recently occupied territory “Novorussia” or “New Russia”, a term referring to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian news agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words that "the prisoner of illusion" is anyone who believes that peace talks are on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians launched a campaign before the parliamentary elections on October 26, while government units attack civilian population in areas controlled by separatists.
“In the interests of the people living in these areas, we need to immediately begin meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and on the status of state sovereignty of Southeast Ukraine,” he said.
Peskov said Putin's insight on state sovereignty was thought in the context of a broader autonomy, which has been discussed with the leadership of Kiev for several months and which aims to mitigate the concerns of Russian-speaking areas about the threat of cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said the necessary autonomy can only be granted to the eastern regions by the Ukrainian government.
This is not a matter to be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The Kremlin spokesman's step, which was intended to correct the "fake interpretation" of Putin's remarks, emphasized the Russian leadership' approach to addressing separatist rebellion in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where the majority of the two million population originally belongs to ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much greater difficulties in annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and public opinion surveys, which took place before the conflict, have shown broad support for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to establish their own trade agreements and international relations, and in essence thus give the Kremlin the actual control of the territory that would unite the Russian continent with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula annexed five months ago is the headquarters of the main Russian marine fleet, the marine trade background and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between the Russian Rostov and Crimea are also a center of mines, factories and slices that produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko during his inaugural speech on June 7 proposed that Ukrainian legislators – after the new elections – consider changes in the constitution that would give the various regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy differs significantly from the vision of the Kremlin and separatists. Moscow is accused of armed and inciting violence.
Putin's last call to act separatists as equal to Kiev followed the further progress of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks from a previously quiet area along the Azov Sea penetrated eastern Ukraine.
Separatists strengthened by the Russians took over the control of Novoazovsk by such a force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that it is a struggle to occupy the strategic coastal territory up to Crimea.
This has accelerated the enormous civil and military efforts to reinforce Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at the meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and urged to take action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent over the past 23 years.
“We are approaching a point from which there is no return,” Poroshenko warned.
There are thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take any definitive steps – the leaders call on the adoption of further sanctions against Russia in the event of a closer unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday told reporters in Kiev that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after last week two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the Donetsk region to support the occupied separatists.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in Ilovajsk during the Russian invasion were replaced on Sunday with 10 Russian landers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrity and Gabi Grecko are also involved in the scandal with revealed photos.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disappointment over the hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his boyfriend Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after in the biggest scandal with hacked photos of celebrity got on the internet a series of explicit photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker claims that he has 60 photos with the naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell and actress Kirsten Dunst.
As a result of the flight from iCloud, personal images of Australian actresses Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actresses Grecko were to be made public.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Greece for his hand last month, told the Confidential magazine: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, has told the online newspapers that the hacking is “no shameful” and those who have become its target “seem humiliated”.
It is believed that the hacker has obtained thirty pictures of Palmer with his former friend Scott Speedman, including two pictures on which he goes up without scratching at the pool.
Palmer performed in the movie Love and Honor, where her counterpart was Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, television series star Chuck Strahovski and thriller actress Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen images yesterday.
Lawrence’s TMZ representative said: “This is a clear breach of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on Twitter: “Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
The footballers of Sigma have won a lot, even without a win.
Olomouc - The storms and flashes that co-owners of Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent on their subordinates last week seem to be a past.
At the end of the day, they brought only a point behind the brinkless remission.
At the end of the day, the club’s leadership and commitment were a bit better.
Money for payments could soon come to the club.
“I leave another match as I talked about last week, but I’m far more optimistic,” Lepr said that despite the fact that Sigma didn’t win, the players convinced him with improved performance.
The fighting and engagement with which we played mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
I can forgive that he won’t.
If we were playing so from the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we haven’t lost yet,” Lepr said.
Sigma in Opava stopped the initial pressure of the home, then the game balanced and in the second half it was better.
After the triumph of Kalvod, the trusters ran, but their possibilities did not reach the goal, and so they couldn't win.
The result is not according to our expectations.
To complete satisfaction we missed but only one changed chance," said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the footballers' attitude was caused by his threat.
There were more aspects.
Whether from my side, from the coach or the fans,” said Lébr.
The pressure has to be counted.
The players did not want to comment on the event last week.
I try to get these things completely away.
I tried not to admit it," the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl dropped his head.
Completely without a comment then left the question on Lébrov's statement last week attacker Václav Vašíček, who didn't change Sigma's biggest opportunity in the Saturday match.
Then he spoke a little about the pressure.
We will always be under pressure.
Everyone wants to pull on us.
Today we’ve shown that if we’re fighting and riding all by the fuck, it’s going to go,” he said.
Warning to the heart.
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not assert that preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere in Olomouc last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was seen that they took the warning of Mr. Lébra to their hearts.
Even before it wasn’t about they didn’t want to fight and flock it out,” Olomouc coach said.
It was the same as the first 15 minutes.
It took us to compare to hardness and realize what the second league is about.
That it’s not just about football, but especially about the fighting,” Kalvoda said.
I hope that in the next few matches it will work from the beginning.
“I would really like to believe it,” he added.
