I don't drink alcohol. I'm not a man.
There seems to be no way out.
We fell asleep.
I was very annoyed by him.
Why should we help you?
I've put the plan into action.
He made a list.
For a while, I was really addicted to Coca-Cola, and I drank it every day.
I think Tom is circling around.
Africa is exporting beef to Europe.
Did you tell Tom why you wanted to go to Boston?
Tom and Mary have gone now.
The more the merrier.
She helped us.
She asked her teacher for advice.
It scared the hell out of him.
What are these things?
I need it.
Is your dog a German shepherd?
We can fix anything.
She wants to buy a gift for her boyfriend.
I went to the beach with Tom and his friends.
Good luck with your exam!
You don't even like fish.
Will you go with them?
Tom finally left.
I don't want to go near them.
He is sure that the weather will be good tomorrow.
I don't usually sleep at night.
I want to stay at home and read a book.
I want Tom to like you.
We don't want him to leave.
I'll be very busy next month.
Due to bad weather, the plane's departure was delayed by two hours.
Sami is reading that book.
All employees are in a union.
I don't like homework.
Tom is diplomatic, isn't he?
What does he say?
This website uses cookies.
Don't you want to stop them?
You can't do this to me!
What did you get me?
You don't have to go.
I read your book. It's very interesting.
There he is!
What are they doing here?
I tried calling him.
Do you travel a lot?
My car is German.
I'm so glad Christmas is here.
I just need to rest a little.
She said she wasn't convinced.
I am totally satisfied with my new house.
Why do you study English every day?
I'd like to cross the United States of America in a convertible.
You won't find them there.
Your explanation is too abstract for me.
These monks live inside the monastery.
I just have to find him.
Can I see this?
He is able to speak Japanese.
I could be wrong.
You're afraid to sleep, aren't you?
Tom will find a job soon enough.
Correct the underlined words.
Did you tell him you were joking?
Keep watching.
When the results are made public, I'll let you know.
I wanted to return to his village.
Tom is satisfied with his success.
You are reliable.
I didn't even consider it.
It's better to have friends in the streets than money in the register.
You can only smoke on the terrace.
I agree with you 100%.
These flowers are not only beautiful, they also have a good scent.
He's at the university now, isn't he?
We should call him.
It's interesting how that happened.
You should remember that.
Tom said he likes teaching French.
He took out a coin from his pocket.
Are you related to her?
Who broke this window?
I'll go and tell them.
If you heard him speak French, you would mistake him for a Frenchman.
He came ten minutes later.
We waited for him yesterday.
Tom said that Mary was short.
Where's the exit?
If I remember correctly, Tom sold his car to Mary for just $500.
I'll call you after lunch.
We didn't agree on anything!
It's highly unlikely.
No doctor can explain it.
I have to try it.
She is depressed.
You're wasting my time.
Aren't you the husband of Mary?
It was all in your imagination.
I'm not voting!
Why can't you do that?
Tom didn't save anything for retirement.
Tom never yells at us.
Lalita called.
I thought you hated us.
I was in my bedroom.
They died.
She met someone.
Tom wanted me to visit Mary.
I ride my bike to work.

I'd be grateful if you could do that for me.
I'm the twin of Tom.
Do you like Mary's new Halloween costume?
He discovered the secret.
Don't give her any ideas.
What's your favorite video game?
Sami's hands are perfect.
Kyoto is an extraordinarily beautiful city.
I can't accept this gift.
It'll be our secret.
It will happen soon.
I saw my sister there.
Why don't you try to fix it?
We've made way too many mistakes.
I hope to see you tomorrow.
What does this have to do with my family?
Let him stay home if he wants!
I've lived here for ten years.
I'd be happy to give you a ride.
He tried to get up early.
I like the blue.
They have many different fish to try.
What is the difference between real diamonds and imitations?
Could you call me later?
I'd like two copies of each of these documents.
I expect I'll have to do that for Tom.
What do you think of the new teacher?
If actions are mightier than words, why is the pen mightier than the sword?
She bought a tea service.
We're all going to die.
Tom continued to cry.
I can't do that yet.
George was out of his mind!
You misled me.
Are you willing to learn?
Poor people have feelings too.
I'm sure Tom is just trying to help.
You smell so good.
I forgot all about them.
He doesn't use it.
I'm messed up.
I know a good Italian restaurant.
We can't let him die.
As far as I know, Tom is retired.
What time does it leave here?
I usually drink a lot of milk.
With a smile, anything is possible.
I like black coffee strong.
He says nobody cares about that kind of thing.
Tom works for a bank.
I had three options.
Tom and Mary won't be happy to see you here.
These goats are very friendly.
The two sisters are so similar that it is difficult to tell them apart.
Why don't koalas have a navel?
Please leave a message.
When was the last time you connected to the Internet?
I played with Tony yesterday.
We can't let that happen.
The thief entered through a broken window.
How do you say "I love you" in your language?
Let's get this started.
You look really pale.
Tom forgot the milk.
That song sounds familiar.
Do you have some chalk?
I'm bringing Tom some food.
I'd like to see some dancing.
I don't feel like eating right now.
Wouldn't you like to eat?
Everyone knows you're rich.
I study at school.
What would Jesus do?
He says he hates studying Berber.
We need to be warmly welcomed and supported.
His handwriting is illegible.
Let me finish my sentence.
I don't understand the politics.
Have you ever read a book in French?
I'm not your angel anymore.
His leg was put in a cast.
The girl likes horses.
Your brother got married, didn't he?
Do you think Tom went to Australia?
Don't blame me for this.
Now, it's your turn.
You were confused.
You don't have to do that without permission.
I like your novel.
Who wrote the Bible?
You will be ready.
We're not drinking.
I came home from school, then I went out with my friends.
I arrived at the station this morning.
Does this make me look fat?
Everything is getting cheap.
He's not our son.
You have osteoporosis.
You can tell her I said that.
I thought you wanted a divorce.
Look at that moon!

Now give me your hands.
I shouted.
Mary also likes bananas.
I'm a housewife.
I want to meet them.
Tom is going to the mall.
Tom wants a big family.
Did you like it?
I should have stayed with her.
We're going to be friends forever.
I never stole anything.
Tom tried to ignore Mary.
I got home late last night.
We ran out of gas in the middle of the desert.
Don't worry, I'll get home safe and sound.
Ask Tom if he'll attend the meeting.
I can't run a business, it's too hard for me.
Is she learning French?
Is that your son?
Tom never asked why.
He was often up late.
I don't often eat bananas.
Get them out of here.
I've never seen them wear hats.
Do you know Tom?
He had a book in his hand.
Give me an ashtray, please.
Who found her?
What exactly did he say?
You need to go to the hospital.

I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

I wasn't impressed.
It's nothing to me.

I really like what I do.
I'm shy.
We're all going to miss him.
Tom started reading.
Fadil bought a house in Cairo.
They spent six months building the house.
The sky was gray.
She's two years younger than me.
We have to go there, whether we like it or not.

Mary saw a mouse.
My father died when I was seven.

I hate to say it, but Tom is right.
I already gave him your number.
Show me another watch.
You want to stop them?
You should have seen them run.
He and I were in the same camp at the time.
Tom doesn't know how much you love him, Mary.
I think I'm being objective.
Tom hasn't heated his car yet.
I'll be happy to help you.
How long will you be staying?
This is intolerable.
I'm grateful to you for inviting me to the party.
I found the book very interesting.
You should buy a new car now.

What are you doing tomorrow?
He was talking to himself.
A $10,000 fine is nothing.
Take me away from here.
I really want to impress them.
What caused the accident?
Have you ever been to a foreign country?
I think I've had too much to drink.
I wrote to him to ask why.
He doesn't have much time.
Skip the boring chapters.
He didn't even touch it.
It's kind of weird, right?
You need to study more.
She'll be seventeen next year.
You learn fast.
You have to save him.
Tom pointed to Mary's car.

I cut my finger with a knife.

Did you vote for Romney or Obama?

I did nothing!
You still don't understand.
I'll tell you more.
I'll call you.
Call me if it rains.

I can't be happy when Tom is so sad.
I want to share this with you.
I'm studying at the university in Hyogo.
We're going to the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life went on without any problems.
No one wants to help us.
They speak very fast.

Don't break my heart.
I don't have plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We had fun.
She is dishonest.
I read books often.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got annoyed.
I'm already old.
I have a bad rap.
Good night, my friends.
He bought an English book in a bookstore.
I'm going to the bookstore tomorrow to buy some books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What's your favorite historical film?
We can't see her.

Tom needs to eat.
Get out of here.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I'm being followed.

I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her !
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?

Tom wants to get to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.

I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I got him.
He adopted the orphan.
I assume they speak French.
Step forward, please.
You need to get more active.
Are Tom and Mary kidding?
It's all gone.
I have no choice.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
You're smarter than him.
What are you doing this summer?
He got irritated.
Can you speak Shanghainese?
It's shrunk because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what had happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was he paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
I'm in London, is that it?
He's still there with her, isn't he?
This is gonna make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a great appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
Who's your favorite female rapper?
Say hi to Tom for me.
It's nice to see you so happy.
I usually swim in the summer.
Why is he leaving so soon?
I'm rather proud of it.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's a picture of him.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom is lucky.
Pass the ketchup, please.
I happened to sit next to her at a convention.
There's no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for class.
It's a little overweight, isn't it?
Who is the man playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
I slept in the car.
Tom and I will go to Boston with Mary.
He spent all his income on drinking.
You have to Google it harder!
That's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
Do you want me to go with you?
I came to see you.
Does this look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I have no feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We've landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When does your new novel come out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.

You're good at that.
How would you like to change it?

I can't raise our son by myself.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot if he drinks wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give you 50,000 for this statue.
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
You should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay in a hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I laugh almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't spoken to him yet.
It was a hot summer evening.
I always walk.
She's determined
You're not very fun at parties, are you?
He looked in his bag for the car keys.
I really don't want to talk.
So he must be Argentine.
I really like my job.
I suggest you be more careful.
She's in shock.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of the American way of cooking.
Tom is dancing with Mary.
Your fate is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
Nobody wants to help you.
It'll clear up this afternoon.

What do you imagine when you look at that painting?
How many continents are there in the world?

We have to inform Tom.
Tom is still sleeping.
Tom is a bit impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.

Do you really think Tom is handsome?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
When does school end?
Tom and I are pretty busy.
He hired me.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I might know someone who can help you.
Can you ride a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a pattern.

It was published in 1969.
We just need to relax.

Why are you so jealous?
Do you think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you have anything to say?
Scandalous! What are you doing?
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Watch your mouth.
I drank the wine.
He is more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're early again.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
You want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.

It was a really scary story.
He's in the truck.
I'm not introducing them.
Do you like golf?
Forgive me for interrupting the other day.
Can you believe this?
I waited for a bus to come.
He found the bug.
You'll never guess where they are.

I heard that Tom is learning to drive.
She knows I love her deeply.
He's trying to kill himself.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is that we don't know where Tom is.
It's under the bed, isn't it?
I cut the branch with an axe.

There are some books on the table.
Come at least at six.

I like my language.
Why won't you answer me?
We are Tom's classmates.

Tom lost his new watch.
Tom sang with Mary.
Is that what you told Tom?
Do you remember your license plate number?
He lied to us.
She has seven children.
Let's listen to some music.
I think it's dangerous for children to play in the pond.
She bought me a nice coat.
The bell rang.
Take it to the men in room 318.
I'm falling in love with her.
We must postpone our departure.
Tom doesn't care either.
We were separated.
It's really early.
You saved Tom's life twice.
I don't like big cities.
This happened to me.
He has quite a few friends in America.
I didn't live in Boston last year.

I remembered that.
It's not impossible.
What do you want me to do?
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
I heard the door close.
She got him drunk.
How are you feeling today?
Would you be interested in working for me?
It reminds me of my childhood.

Tom arrived in Boston last night.
You are stubborn.
I'm not feeling nervous.

Sami isn't here to ruin your day.
I took off my shoes.
I'm learning Esperanto now.
He hired mercenaries to kill Sami.
Are those yours?
The woman is drinking water now.
Tom was a lawyer.
People here are picky about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is cheap, it will soon close if the food doesn't taste good.
The man Tom and Mary are talking to is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He's a man of his word.
I'm free this evening.
Do you think I'm too tall?
What should we do now?

Why don't you do it yourself?
It's finally here!

Everybody was talking about it.
Are you telling me you're not busy?
He hates decks.
Go home now.

Come home before it gets dark.

I will never forget that night.
Be cheerful, add an exclamation point to all your sentences.

I don't want to forget her.
I can't open it!
Tell Tom that I'm innocent.
I bought a pair of shoes.

He asked how to cook the fish.
No one will believe your story.
Tom is a golden boy.
You seem to be prejudiced against ideas that come from foreign countries.

I didn't mean to hit Tom so hard.
She makes me sick.
I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll meet her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Finish the sentence.
The clock broke.
I won't wait forever.
Just give the order.

What are you pointing to?
I became friends with him while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by his intelligence.
She stuck the balloon.
We have to go.
Staying home is no fun.
I'm sure Tom will be awake.
She can't find her hat.
Mr. Young would like his son to study more.

How much paper do you need?
Can you confirm that?
It was a waste of money.

Bring some wine.
I was very proud.
You're very fast.
How about a beer?
I had no idea you were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You are a brave man.
You're not surprised?
It only costs a coin.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a moment.
We're eating together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the picture on.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where did you have lunch?
He's the last person who can tell a lie.
June's not that far away either.
Why do you hate Tom so much?
You know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He kicked me out of the house.
My shoes are wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you leaving me?
Tom has always liked you.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, OK?
You wanted to ask me questions?
Don't make fun of Tom.
You'll land on your feet.
I took risks.
Two people were killed in a car accident.

Tom actually apologized to Mary.
Why doesn't he sit with me anymore?
I want you to look for them.
I left the party too soon.
I should have eaten more.

I lost him.
I almost dropped the plates.
There's a phone in my room.
Is it serious?
Tom dialed 911.
We're brother and sister.
Are you interested in Buddhism?
It's been a good week.
You want a tray with that?
You don't know me.
Nobody wants to work.
Please drive slower.
How do we fix it?
This is last month's magazine.
They're not back yet.
She's about your age, isn't she?
He's in the back.
We can't let them die.
It's a bundle of nerves.
Tom arrived late.
Tom stayed behind.
This will be discussed tomorrow.
How did you spend your vacation?
When he left the Army, Roger Miller moved to the country music house in Nashville, Tennessee.
Mary corrected it.
Did you ever talk to him?
I think Tom won't be able to do that.
When did you get back from London?
Tom is always in a good mood.
Can I get you some coffee?
He left the village to study.
I've never seen you dance.
Tom bent down to take a closer look.
Can you save them?
So you and Hanna are thinking about getting married?
You can drive, right?
They need us to finish the job.
I've been here twice now.

It is interesting, isn't it?
Mary accidentally ran into Tom.
I'm not anyone's enemy.
I forgot her number.
The two teams fought very hard.
I think there's a mistake in my account.
Tom didn't convince me.
Sami had some painful secrets.
You want me to be honest?
What are you going to do?
Tom looks tired. Please take him home.
May all your wishes come true!
He already has.
He is an expert with a word processor.
He was at the gate of death.
You're hurt, aren't you?
Your table is ready.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?
Tom and Mary have a car, don't they?
Let's talk about it.
I can't solve this problem.
He hit him in the head.
It's going to be so much fun.
Tom told Mary what not to do.
Mind your own business!
It was extremely scary.
I'm telling you a story.
You're homesick, are you?

Here's what to do.

Tom decided to risk everything for love.
We heard him coming down the stairs.
I'm the best.

You're a part of me.
She took her brother to the zoo.
You look perfect.
I'm actually a bastard.
I don't want to sit next to you.
Look at that!
They know who he is.
Let's open it up.
It is a disease to be obsessed with winning, it is a disease to be obsessed with using martial arts, and it is a disease to be obsessed with presenting everything you have learned. It is a disease to be obsessed with attacking, and it is also a disease to be obsessed with defending. It is also a disease to be obsessed with getting rid of the disease. To fix the mind obsessively on anything is considered a disease.

Where did I put my keys?
Have you ever read the Bible?
We tried everything.
"Look at that!" he said, triumphantly.
I'll give him a piece of advice.
How are your summer vacations going?
I don't like poker at all.
How's your job search going?
I heard Tom was killed.
I was ready to do that.
Tom is silly.
Mike came back from the library at five.
I did not vote for Tom.
He was seen crossing the street.
I'm like my brother.
I will go.
Do you really think that's necessary?
Everyone who came along the way was surprised.
What about here?
Write your name here.
He's very selfish, isn't he?
I could try.
He got lost while he was walking in the woods.
How long are you staying?
Tom and Mary are really jealous, aren't they?
They gave an answer to every question.
Please fill the front.
I came here to learn.
Drink your medicine.
I can see a pattern.
He was unable to attend the party.
Do you still collect stamps?
It's not for them.
They're both brave.
He spilled his drink on my tux.
Why don't you wear that hat anymore?
The report soon became known throughout the country.
I love your daughter.
Are you bored like me?
Mary kissed her father on the cheek.
What kind of beer do you have?
We're used to living in a big city.
They are our dearest friends.
In general, the climate of Japan is mild.
I had three exams today.
I had no idea you were coming.
I'm sorry, but I'm not paid enough to worry.
Where do you keep your bottle opener?
Don't you understand?
Can you teach me how to play chess?
What time should I wake you up?
There's no one here.
You should apologize to them.
I'd like to buy a dog.
Layla wondered where Sami was.
Take Tom outside.
I was happy then.
I told him I'm not hungry.
Tom is messy, isn't he?
They said they were embarrassed.
Please take them.
Please come home.
I like professional wrestling.
Tom is smart.
Don't be so formal, please!
You think that's a clue?
I don't think Tom's jokes are particularly funny.
He does everything very quickly.
Please don't kill me!
I bit my lip.
You're a moralist.
She's always been a hothead.
She likes beans.
I'm having trouble falling asleep right now.
The relief is instantaneous.
Lida is a close friend of Mary's.
Please don't interrupt me while I'm talking.
I hope to attend.
I never lied to you.
She ate an apple.
Don't judge people by their appearance.
She is jealous.
Right, I see what you mean.
You'll be safe here.
Are you proud of your father?
Tom is grumpy.
You've been to Berlin before.
You're too young to be in love.
Stay with me.
Where did Tom put my passport?
Now lie down.
He's finally decided to get married.
Can I use your phone?
Is there nothing we can do?
The relationship "A loves B" is not reflexive, transitive or symmetrical.
Add more salt to the soup.
You just have to sweep the floor.
Don't give a child more money than he needs.
Tom thinks Mary lied.
I'm not talking about it.
I'm a fucking economist, you know.
Tom wouldn't understand.
Would you like something to drink?
I'm here to help you.
He was too drunk to drive home.
I heard some rumours.
I respected Tom.
So what happened next?
She's ready now.
Go play with him.
Now go brush your teeth.
I can't fire them.
He had a fit of rage.
Don't make a sound while you eat soup.
Please go to the supermarket and buy some fruit.
I realized I wasn't ready.
Mr. White went to Canada.
Do you think Tom is funny?
It's not certain she'll be going back to her husband's house.
I'm getting a lot of that right now.
He said he wasn't interested.
What does the note say?
I don't have to answer to you for my actions.
Mr. Gomez did not apologize for my mistake.
Is he a foreigner?
I think you're perfect.
Let's send them all home.
The thermometer is three degrees below zero.
Even though Marcel works hard, he only makes 30,000 Canadian dollars a year.
Where do you put them?
Can I have a euro?
Tom was the only one who wasn't eating.
I wouldn't want to do anything against the law.
Evaluate your progress.
How many runs does this bus have per hour?
She wasn't a very good pianist.
You have cats?
Women like men with moustaches.
He fell out of the tree.
He's going to contribute to this project.
The tree is sick.
Tom will probably be bored.
It was a good choice.
The frost has caused a lot of damage to the crops.
Tom deserves an explanation.
Try to think about it.
Are you ready to study Klingon?
Who wrote "The Prince"?
I'll pretend this never happened.
Sometimes a little pride is all we need.
Tom lost his money, his family and his friends.
He lives here all by himself.
He convinced me.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
You kissed him, didn't you?
Why isn't Tom here today?
That should be interesting.
He moved west to Nashville, Tennessee.
I'll call you later.
Where do you want to go?
Tom knows exactly how Mary feels.
Have you ever heard Tom sing?
Didn't Tom tell you?
She misled me.
Can rabbits swim?
Sami was trying to learn Arabic.
You've grown taller.
Call my wife.
They'll understand.
He read an article.
She couldn't come because of her illness.
Sometimes he's late for school.
My son is brushing his teeth.
I always liked this restaurant.
I couldn't understand anything Tom said.
Dogs are territorial.
Tom is playing in the park.
Can someone open the door, please?
I was just doing my job.
I want to ask them when their big day is.
Feed the bird.
You know I love Tom, don't you?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
He comes at noon.
You're a busy man, aren't you?
Tom asked everyone to leave.
I am very frustrated.
She cried when she heard the terrible news.
I'm afraid it's too late to say no.
You are important.
He convinced his wife not to divorce him.
My answer matches yours.
There is no life without electricity and water.
I'm right about that.
They won't see me without an appointment.
She threw her boyfriend out of the house.
Have you ever written a letter to Mary?
He behaves very shyly in her presence.
Tom is spoiled.
It's probably a mistake.
He's a famous painter and should be treated as such.
Our cities create serious pollution problems.
Tom has a job.
How dare you talk to me like that!
Tell him to go.
I like autumn best of all.
Tom is suspicious.
The good news is that we'll be able to help her.
I usually take a bath before going to bed.
What I want is a word processor.
What brought you to Boston?
Do I bother you sometimes?
You want me to leave now?
We are outraged.
I hope you had a great day!
I'm feeling stressed out.
Mary chuckled.
We all wanted revenge.
Tom will never agree.
I'm a diligent one.
I'm sure they're talking about us.
I got lucky today.
He looks like a baboon.
"Do you have a dog?" "No".
He has a strange temper.
Have faith in God.
Promise me you'll help her.
I wonder why Tom isn't here.
A lot of people thought he was too young to be president.
Tom wondered if Mary could speak French.
Our train arrived late.
Why is Tom looking at me?
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
What's Tom like when he's angry?
He is so lazy.
Help Tom with his studies.
Do you like to travel?
Do you like Tom?
I don't want to be afraid of Tom anymore.
What's keeping you up so late?
You don't have a wife, do you?
It was sudden.
Just use mine for now.
He risked his life to save her.
We can't be friends anymore.
He didn't give me anything.
Your father was right.
Tom is very generous.
Did you let Tom kiss you?
How old could his grandfather be?
They're too deep in debt to get the small business loan.
Do you have any oranges?
Tom seems to be annoyed.
I know you spent the last three years in prison.
That's the norm.
The office is empty.
He sleeps a lot.
Don't hold it upside down.
We must preserve our peaceful constitution.
This is a man dressed as a woman.
Tom is unfeeling.
Could you call him?
You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
Tom has a two-room house.
Don't say such stupid things!
Give them the keys.
Could you tell me how to get to the station?
It's good already.
I think Tom is flexible.
We'll wait for Tom in the lobby.
I made a fool of myself.
She was dangerous.
She was pleased with the new dress.
You see this?
Tom has no empathy.
Is Tom busy?
He could die.
He's too dependent on him.
Tom is kind to me.
It's not gonna happen.
Tom is at home, but Mary isn't.
Forget about him.
You are different.
I wasn't mad.
Tom passed away.
I know you hate school.
My fiancée's daughters signed up for Facebook.
Sami called Layla for her birthday.
I was very annoyed by him for being so late.
The princess is wearing a golden tiara.
You're still in shock, aren't you?
He is a little jealous.
He weighs over eighty kilos.
She doesn't drive for fear of having an accident.
Send him that paper.
A couple of red sticks broke.
The train arrived in London.
Do your colleagues like their work?
Where do you think we are?
Thirteen Americans were killed.
I was disfigured.
I have frequent contact with foreign students.
I have a very pretty fiancée.
I don't see him anymore.
It is unpredictable.
This dive watch is a little expensive.
The torch doesn't light at the base.
Put your books away.
His days are numbered.
Tom does what he wants.
The river flooded the entire region.
You better fight sleep.
It really sucks.
I have to go help her.
Sami waited.
I forgot his address.
Were you in love with them?
Hey, did you hear that?
Tom went to France two months ago.
I'm pretty weak right now.
Tom couldn't control himself.
You never trust Tom.
I don't look anything like Tom.
Our work is never done.
You know Tom likes Mary.
Why was he so slow?
We've seen three wars.
The flowers are blooming.
Let's go and find them.
Do you study French?
In 1900 he left England and never returned.
Tom is saving money for college.
The city has been abandoned by its inhabitants.
Tom is rich and powerful.
He can't be more than 20 years old.
Have you read any of Agatha Christie's books?
He deserves a promotion.
I want you to stay where you are.
Was I really boring?
Are we getting pizza?
Tom and Mary visited Scandinavia.
He's the fifth man in line.
I hate watching TV.
Iran is planning to send a monkey into space.
Do you have any brothers and sisters?
You didn't listen to me.
You convinced me.
Layla left Sami.
Can you type?
Tom isn't my boyfriend. He's just a friend.
Tom never apologized for what he did to us.
What method did you use to quit smoking?
The Morales are in the room.
We went to the beach.
I think they'll be late.
Tom is annoyed.
You shouldn't listen to me.
It doesn't make any difference.
You don't have to change.
Oh, look, they're making out!
I wish he had attended the conference.
Tom was taken to the emergency room.
I have a question for you.
Tom called at 2:30.
I live in Osaka.
I'm a doctor, Jim, not a lawyer.
I'm saving this place for you.
Tom didn't know who Mary was.
I'm not going to find a girlfriend.
The weather is nice today.
It didn't matter to anyone.
Are you from Urumqi?
Let me take you to the hospital.
We love what we do.
Together, anything is possible!
I want you to be better.
He didn't come back.
You'd better go help them.
He ordered him not to give orders.
I think Tom is in trouble.
I'd like you to accompany him.
Have you been to Cairo?
She must have gone out.
I'm not worried about you.
What do you want to do for work?
We want to meet him.
Do you like the songs?
Do you really think Tom is honest?
I'm getting married soon.
They added a woman to the committee.
Tom didn't frighten me.
I'm working here.
He can't swim.
You can talk to me, you know?
Are you always busy?
Did he tell you what to do?
Don't fuck with her!
How long have you lived in Kobe?
How do you like your new job?
Tom skipped school.
It wasn't so cold yesterday.
I like Tom a lot.
Tom threw up in the bucket.
Sami doesn't celebrate Halloween.
You'll never see them again.
I tried to contact him.
He made room for an elderly woman on the bus.
What's he doing here?
This is a delicate issue.
I went to see a movie with Tom after work.
He'll always be there.
I'm trying to avoid them.
No one can understand it.
I'm getting weak!
He's a little overweight, isn't he?
I never believed him.
I'm not his angel anymore.
Tom probably won't be shy.
He can recite the poems.
She closed a door.
I don't want Tom to do that here.
I'm in Rome.
Tom gave Mary a Christmas present.
I can tell you're angry.
She passed away yesterday afternoon.
Were you blindfolded?
We're getting help.
This guy tried to kill me.
We got to New York at night.
Why did Tom kiss Mary?
Come on, you two, don't be foolish.
It's a little late for that, don't you think?
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Everyone knew you.
Why did you sign the confession?
I know Tom is guilty.
You only have two options.
You seem surprised.
I'll ask around.
I don't remember any of it.
Tom speaks French perfectly.
He bought bread.
Tom started working immediately.
Do you like this flower?
Do you know Mr. Jackson?
I shouldn't have stayed.
Tom is trying to fix his car.
Do you think Tom is still awake?
Why are you giving Tom money?
It could be better.
He really hates this way of thinking.
Do not associate with them.
I speak French.
Here's an even better idea.
We're all finished here.
I don't have a plan right now.
She calls him often.
She's a musicologist.
Why are you giving Tom money?
Even the children know.
Mary prepared breakfast for her husband.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
We should have tried harder.
Which one of these is yours?
I just changed my mind.
I said I was hungry.
I haven't read any of those books.
Liisa was tired of the noise.
Tom was in the garden.
It's a pain, isn't it?
Do you wear glasses?
Are you sure Tom won't be angry?
Tom will call the cops.
Please fill the front.
Tom forgot his umbrella again.
Do you have a cell phone?
He seems honest to me.
Don't turn off the light.
They still live with their parents.
Who doesn't like that?
They used the truth serum.
You're allowed to do that.
I didn't know what to say.
I'm feeling really good.
Give me some of that.
This is Tony.
He is rich, but unpleasant.
Read the book out loud.
I think I'll go and get them.
Where did you exchange them?
I asked Tom and Mary for their keys.
He said he'd call me.
He's never had a wrench in his hand.
I was able to save them.
Do you think Tom is guilty?
Why would we want to punish you?
We are not disappointed.
Your handwriting is illegible.
Do you like Tom's tattoos?
Do you have any books on Armenia?
He's as busy as ever.
He called his lawyer.
Are you drunk?
Tom seemed stunned.
I'm tired of singing.
Tom won't buy a new car.
Do you love her?
Tell her we're not available.
Is Tom around?
I need to talk to him now.
I can't see them.
No one will know.
You want to do business or not?
He asked for a beer.
