28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead in San Francisco Shopping Center
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the slope of a local shopping mall this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he doesn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt him, and says, “His affairs finally went well.”
The body, which was found in the Westfield Mall shopping mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the San Francisco Office of Mortality Investigation said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was defined as a murder and that an investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a line chef in Boston, had received his dream job as a line chef at San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were “horrored and shocked” by his death.
“We have a small team that acts like a close family and we will miss him very much,” the spokesman said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first spent the night in the hostels, but recently “his affairs finally went well.”
“He found an apartment and met a girl,” Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a big heart.
His way of feeling a part of the family was to make food for us, to make dinner for us,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to get involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother who was riding with the river.
“In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a slippery diamond that shone brighter every day,” he said.
Anyone with any information on the matter is requested to call the San Francisco Police Department's emergency line at 415-575-4444.
Medical practitioners on strike: demands for new work fighting measures
Representatives of medical practitioners have asked their trade unions to approve new labour struggle measures in their dispute over the new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is calling on the entire council to support new labor struggle measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers have failed to address concerns over the deal.
In July, medical practitioners and medical students voted to reject the agreement agreed with BMA.
58% of voters rejected it.
In a letter to members via Twitter Thursday evening, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the board had remained “extremely silent” on issues that she said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: “In light of this, the JDC board has voted to completely reject the proposed new agreement and to call for formal renegotiation of all your concerns.”
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Board of Directors has today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain a mandate for a gradually advancing and expanding work struggle program starting early in September.
The controversy has resulted from the fact that medical practitioners have participated in six strikes this year, including the first complete job shutdown in the history of the NHS healthcare system.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the head of BMA’s medical practitioners, resigned after a vote rejected BMA’s recommended terms.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54,000 medical practitioners and students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the deal would be prescribed to British doctors.
Russia and Turkey: a coalition of foreigners?
It ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to formally end the eight-month battle of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
At the time, we were handcuffed.
But Putin’s smile looked overwhelming, and he didn’t threaten the heat at all, even according to his own restricted norms.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, continuously talked about his “beloved friend” Putin – five times, according to one report.
In the bills.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even better.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan behaving as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his intonation depicts the opposite.
But the coolness radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction was furious.
Putin accused Ankara of knocking Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, impossible.
The opinion of the general public in Russia has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media led an astonishing, thorough assault on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled Syrian territories.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received his apology from President Erdogan.
Russia achieved a victory.
The benefits of a strict cease-fire agreement are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost removed from power in the failed coup last month.
The continued terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motivation.
Russia’s economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which typically carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
As for Russia, local tour operators and subscription airlines are relieved as flights eventually continue.
They are hoping for a late season of rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week the state television has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after the import of agricultural products from Turkey is again allowed.
“Tourists there, tomatoes back here,” as the Vedemosti newspaper.
But the visit also had a political added value for Moscow.
The West is angry at what is seen as a weak response to a coup attempt.
Added to the long-lasting outrage over the rapid progress of EU accession negotiations, Putin emerges, eager to take advantage of the coolness and break Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader was assured to get free points from Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a survival for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of a change in power.
So this meeting at the palace on the coast of the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present a “coalition of outsiders,” as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries who feel the West has rejected them and mistreated them, uniting their forces.
However, these two have great differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adjusted itself to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It may be much-talking that after three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the matter.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their disagreements, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for a common basis on Syria.
After months of open hostility, and considering the possibility of a complete catastrophe with a NATO member Turkey shooting down a Russian fighter jet, it is better for the two leaders to be again even in talks.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank’s chief executive, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be removed from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank’s international goals.
After the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued, it has given up on these goals.
The bank’s strategists have now used the “RBS” brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to let more national brands come to the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is operating with Scottish clients, but it will not be restarted from scratch.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except headquarters and stock exchanges are converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of clients and staff at the Inverness Show.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will become our investor brand and the employer of our employees, as we now become a much more brand bank.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
We no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their respective communities, and our staff work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“Now is the time to move toward the banking of brands, because basically (we’ve been asking) it’s about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers,” said the CEO.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for our customers and offer these brands.
But with the work we’ve done focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I believe you’ll see a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Predilection and reaches 3,000 winnings
Dettor Spray Champagne After Double-Winning He Has a Total of 3,000 Wins
Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone with his second win on the home track in the evening when he competed with Predilection, which was coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing.
She follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggot, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion hockey Dettori, who previously won with Ghayyar, said, “This is special.”
I am very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because here I started 30 years ago.
This is not a big event, this is not a Royal Ascot, but an ordinary Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettor suckles his pleasures as he drives Predilection out after the victory.
Two racing riders have achieved this milestone in obstacle racing - champion hockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4,300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racing riders of the current era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactical excellence distinguishes him from others in the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador for competition, his intonation and charisma have attracted fans to the genre for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have ridden with 6000 winners if he wasn’t just a weekend and big game jockey!
Seriously speaking, Frankie has been riding winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is amazing to see.
He’s a vibrant person who’s a good thing for British competition, but in addition he’s an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated a milestone with a flying landing from the seat.
From flying landings to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This was a mountain.
He won numerous big races, including his famous ‘Magnificent Seven’ victory at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane crash and suffered a competition ban due to drugs.
Three years ago, he had a hard start when he returned after a six-month ban, but he showed considerable character strength in challenging the doubters and returning to his best shape.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years old.
Russian President Vladimir Putin removes Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin had “ordered Ivanov to resign from his position as head of the Russian presidential regime,” but no reason was given.
Ivanov’s deputy director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, Estonia in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he headed the presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin’s website says.
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the main task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in drafting laws and in controlling the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that Perseo be appointed in his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a move that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies and, like Putin, served in the Soviet security service KGB.
As a commander, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
During a meeting on state television with President Putin, the two men claimed that the chief of staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, only a few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.
Is this just a form of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man, once advertised as a potential presidential candidate, suddenly wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy, has been received very suspiciously.
In comments quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov told Putin, “It is true that early in 2012, in a conversation, I asked you to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex, maybe even work, task.
Now I’ve been chief of staff for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov accepted the task in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the state security service in the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy head.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, because Putin's third term would have been unconstitutional.
However, this task went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson gets kicked after beating producer
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at the series' shooting venue in Los Angeles.
The series’ producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his resignation in a joint statement.
Gibson, who starred in Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
There were creative differences and quarrels.
I regret that this happened,” he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson’s character will be removed from the series telling the team of FBI agents will be expected later.
The 54-year-old star of Dharma & Greg has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
“I love the Criminal Minds series, and I’ve given it my best for the last twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but it is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team and above all the best fans the series can have.
The 12th season of the series is scheduled to start on September 28.
Mysterious fish ended up in the garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windshells left behind by a water wheel.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted film footage of the apparition on Periscope in the hope that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to FIFA
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern edge of the Queensferry Crossing Point and the land bridge, meaning the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four bridges between the front lines that are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 arches.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the workplace today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing the truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to build this bridge section alone.”
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, finishing the fence between the land bridge and the bridge roof is a demanding operation in which extreme precision dimensions must match.
Overall, almost 79 percent of the bridge cover is now in place and the concrete cover of the last portion of the cover is poured today in Rosyth, meaning that the entire cover is ready to be raised to the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager at Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure in any bridge project is always a major milestone.
In this fantastic project, this closure represents the pinnacle of construction technology.
After the last part of the road was installed and connected to the expanding north pillar, we had to close the remaining part from the north, that is, the inland side.
This was done by pulling the northern sideway 700 millimeters southward.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
Enormous because it is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at a slope of about 3%.
Demanding because the allowed measurement deviations under which the team worked were small, just a few millimeters in both directions.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are “lucky to be alive”
Three men are “lucky to be alive” after they fell from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station issued an alert at 13:20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw an incident developing in Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim safely as their boat continued to advance on their own.
“We saw the boat rotating closer to the men and we imagined the worst,” said Vince Jones, rescue boat rover at Moelfre.
“Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we started,” he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third, a 60-year-old, was found hanging on a boy without a lifeguard.
The men were taken to the rescue boat and brought back to the rescue station.
Jones said, “These three men who fell into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat’s engine had a killing gear, but it was somehow disconnected from the person driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respected hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have worried about the fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and take part in some activity.
Display time was initially limited to television, then video games, and now more recently to smartphones.
So it’s great to see that technology and outdoor activity don’t rule out each other.
I’m referring, of course, to the wildness called Pokémon Go. an app based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later from them came the cartoon series, game cards, and other subsequent products).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
As explained in the peanut shell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and can be “photographed” (via a phone screenshot) or “catch” after being found.
The generation that played the game as younger has joined the wild and jumped up from the couch in search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the “average person.”
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s release, the number of people who move 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent among the users who followed Cardiogram.
The company doesn’t know who’s playing Pokémon Gota, it only sees training level data.
The calls from many public health campaigns to “find 30”, “rise up from the couch” and “be active every day” have not produced any results because most public health warnings are boring and cared for by people who seem unhappy.
The importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps in weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to list here.
The fine thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunlight, and fun.
Some people even get new friends while hunting.
As usual, angry pleasures look for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk toward the door.
What then ?
There has been a breakthrough.
Although there were previously apps like Fitbit that could be used to track activity, they did not give a reason to move in the same way that this game did.
The news enthusiasm disappears and use decreases in time.
However, with the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, better fit, and healthier.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to it.
Energy in jumping.
Smooth in Bombay.
Incredible in Permanence.
Great everywhere .
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast achieved the multi-match championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the eye of the Olympic Games.
His total score, 62,198, was clearly better than the silver medalist and “Final Five” teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States balanced in the women’s multi-match finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win the multi-match championship in a row, and the fifth American champion overall. At the same time, she consolidated her reputation as the best of her generation, and of all time.
He burst into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement raises him into the same category as other top athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their race to a new level:
Biles has dominated his genre for the last three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold medals, with programs whose mix of ambition and precision has been so stunning that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him “the best gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
The final test awaited in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of excessive expectations.
Returning home to Texas Springs without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
U.S. Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning gold and silver medals (in this order) in the women’s rack gymnastics multi-match individual final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, August.
Biles achieved his first medal on Tuesday as he served as a culmination at the start of retired national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles argued that he has never thought about the future as he walks his long way to the top, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program — one of which includes his brand name, the volt sound — has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is not coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a taaper, and found by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother while she was on a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, has become a driving force.
He hasn’t lost in a multi-match since the summer of 2013, and this win-win line will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
A balance boom and a permanto in which Biles is the dominant world champion awaited.
He reached the top with 15,433 boom points and surpassed them with 15,933 permanent points.
Raisman hugged him benevolently as they waited for the endpoints — a mere formality — and tears rose into Biles’ glitter red, white, and blue bounded eyes when the dream about which he once wrote his sketch became a reality.
Raisman’s performance was some sort of revenge for four years ago, when he was divided third, but lost bronze to Mustafin in the reboot.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call “grandmother,” was clearly in the lead.
He sent airbags to the public after his permanent performance in the emotional shock of his return, which sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Biles, this 19-year-old’s widespread tweet this week gets an entirely new meaning:
Police: Three killed while listening to music in car
The two women and a 12-year-old girl who were killed in the first serial killing in Phoenix in the last decade were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the road on June 12.
The gunman, who stood on the side of the passenger, shot eight times in the hand and then fled with another vehicle.
According to police, the triple death did not appear to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take his handbags or the $2,900 of another adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman Colonel Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two injured in nine attacks over the past four months in two mainly Latin American neighborhoods.
“These are happening in a residential area in front of your home,” Howard told CBS’s subsidiary, KPHO, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan of the late 1990s, a black BMW of the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks were interrelated and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital due to her injuries, where she later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis’s daughter, Maleah, died on the scene.
A witness told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police notice about the shooting, which occurred only half an hour before the triple killings and targeted an empty open-packed car.
The researchers found shells of bullets, bullet from the seat, and bullet fragments from the motor space.
6-year-old mother with microcephaly: “Situation is getting easier”
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
“When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn’t do this.
I cannot do this.
I did not promise that.
What is not true at all, of course, I promised,” he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a hospital.
“My first reaction was, ‘I didn’t know people were still doing it,’” Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walkway.
Edmund did not sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still does not speak.
But he is slowly reaching some milestones.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
She also loves to play with her two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows how Edmund’s signs refer to “Can you sing to me?”
“We’re teaching him the sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But this is not an ordinary sign language — he tells us that Edmund has invented some of his own sign languages.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of different causes: genetic, such as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of people infected with Zika.
Piccido remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I just asked what would happen.
What will happen?
In fact, he still doesn’t know.
In fact, I haven’t asked for a prediction for a long time, because I don’t expect anyone to really give me that.
But Picciutto has a hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
The situation is easing.
You can believe that the situation will get easier.
You love your child and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and floods cause rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread floods in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday.
The National Weather Service that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded over their edges and caused widespread flooding due to extreme heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state authorities are constantly in contact with local authorities and that help is already coming to districts in need.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office for Security and Emergency Preparedness, said they are receiving requests for rising water vehicles, boats, and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood guard will be in place until Saturday in much of Southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that there is an expectation of three to five centimeters more rain in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood guard was in effect on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which flows near Baton Rouge, and the Amite River, which flows near Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana, and were predicted to set a flood peak during the weekend.
Weather predictor Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said the threat is flooding the Ascension County below the river as flooded rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level ever on Friday morning at 9 a.m.
Rescuers are still picking up people from the flood waters in the counties of Amite and Wilkinson in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and sons were among the rescued near the Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says the water in Beaver Creek, normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says another boyfriend who lived nearby warned him.
“We woke up and the water just continued to rise,” Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she had never seen a stream water so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members have all the injuries, and that he is the only one able to swim.
Hansford said rescuers rescued the trio in a large, military-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station, where the rescued stayed overnight on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding is “rapidly spreading” as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says one eyewitness near Livingston 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was completely tired of the heavy rain that continued until Wednesday.
Heavy rains and flooding of streets led to rescues of residents from their homes and cancellations of lessons in five school districts, authorities said.
CBS subsidiary WWL that a member of the city council in Tangipaho said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now under flooding.
County Chairman Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and 7 pets that had been blocked by rising water.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, shelters have been opened for those who have been evacuated.
“They’ll be allowed to go back to their homes when the water starts to drop,” he said.
In the city of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, twenty streets were closed due to rising water, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep water away from their homes and.
“The last major flood here was in March,” said Lacy Landrum, the city’s government official.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Chief Rupert Lacy said that steady rain continued on the Gulf coast.
He said a handful of houses were flooded on Thursday, but so far no flooding has been on Friday.
Keith Townson, director of Shopper Value Foods in Amity, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen before,” Townson said, “and it’s still raining.”
Six-Year-Old Mahaj Brown Survives Philadelphia Shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which is the second six-year-old boy shot in the city this week.
His grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown suffered several gunshot wounds, including in the hip, leg, arm, and stomach, but was conscious when she was transferred to the hospital.
“He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets,” his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I cannot believe it.
In the hospital, the boy’s condition has been recognised as critical, and he has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
The boy was starting first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also killed: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was to be in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the wounded men could be the shooter.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia that it seems that there was a crossroads between several shooters on the spot.
Assault weapons-type shells, derived from various types of assault weapons, filled the scene.
It seemed to be a continuous struggle.
There were hills on both sides of the sidewalk.
“So it looks like there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in an active battle,” Philadelphia police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and according to the information received, the police are investigating the tape of the surveillance camera.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was mistakenly struck in her hand on Tuesday while she was playing in front of her home in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
He is recovering and police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabbie, and Laurie
So I’m calling for this year’s women’s Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It has also established the inclusion of black and Latin American women at the top of the genre.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is awesome.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised as an Olympic winner, and America applauded.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who perform unexpected but masterful gymnastics.
On Thursday, she became the fourth American woman to win a single gold in a women's multi-match in a row.
Teammate Aly Raisman won the silver medal.
We see the peak of the species, but the situation does not look like this in gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all followed the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are the “Final Five” (the last five) because the next Olympic gym team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly’s last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is a expensive kind, and gymnasts, as a rule, practice in private gymnastics clubsined by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts, as well as families) and the list goes on.
A large proportion of these gyms are located in prosperous suburban neighborhoods that can support the species.
In these clubs, gymnasts get all their coaching, and this is a costly and long-term commitment for gymnast families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles’ coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez’s coach, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to communities with numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby, and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and Latinos) and have trained national and international masters.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mental diligence, discipline and determination.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health and school and work success.
This team’s inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and it’s amazing.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We are living an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious “girl power” by winning the Olympic team goal, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to embark on the path toward a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
Medical practitioners organising new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt’s proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association employees, but 58 percent of the 37,000 medical practitioners voted against it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the deal, saying that the NHS was “on unknown soil,” and that even minor further delays would hurt staff and patients.
The first medical practitioners will be transferred to a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work patterns to improve care during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of BMA’s Medical Practitioner Committee, said last night in a statement: “Medical practitioners still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially that it will accelerate the existing labor crisis and that it will not treat all doctors equally.”
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors is transferred to a new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA’s attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have encountered government reluctance to participate and sometimes deep silence.
This despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that his doors will always be open.
“Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of medical practitioners.
If he does not, the medical practitioners are ready to continue working fighting.
The latest strike in late April meant the postponement of 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 reception hours, as nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to replace the doctors on strike guard.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for the 54,000 medical practitioners covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, urged medical practitioners not to go on strike.
Mortimer said, “Working struggles very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, and cause concern, anxiety and disturbance to patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have been discussing with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision (Guardian Role) and reporting (Whistleblowing).
Employers were hopeful that the ongoing positive discussion on other important topics – such as development, training flexibility, additional training for those returning from the Sabbath leave, training costs, mutual recognition of curricula, study leave and gender pay disparities in medicine – is a sign of the seriousness of employers, the Health Education England education organization and the Ministry of Health in respecting the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
Paying 2 Pounds a Day Can Reduce Heart Attack Risk
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from paying two pounds a day for the drug after authorities recommended it to be given to people for longer.
A anticoagulant drug, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurring seizures in people with heart disease.
The drug is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or another seizure.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Approximately 140,000 people in England suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are due to the fat substance accumulated in the wall of the artery, which forms a stenosis.
If the strain breaks, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart causing a heart attack.
If the clot dissolves, it can pass through with blood and disrupt blood flow to the brain causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca, and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making it less likely to develop a blood clot.
A draft of NICE guidelines published today recommends that humans be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice a day for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE’s Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective preventive treatments, up to a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will subsequently suffer another heart attack or stroke, with consequences often devastating.”
Fear of relapse can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in lowering the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With the preliminary recommendation of ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to add available treatment options to several thousand people who could potentially benefit from them.
Due to limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially as regards the risk of bleeding, over periods of more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend treatment longer than this period.
The culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year for corruption, giving a boost to the government’s report.
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread voting fraud being ignored in Muslim communities, a shocking government report reveals today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles accuses police, election guards and city councils of ignoring evidence of electoral fraud due to “racial and religious over-sensitivity.”
A former community secretary, the current anti-corruption emperor, said voter intimidation on religious grounds is so severe that police should be allowed to set up guard chains outside polling stations to protect feared voters.
He recommends that voters present an identity card when voting to prove who they are.
Nowadays, voters only have to say their name and address.
The report even suggests that the person who votes should put an indelible ink on the finger so that no one can vote twice.
Those whistleblowers should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for wider access for the press to the documents and decisions of the Board of Directors made by informal committees or by a working group.
“This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but it would protect local governments from a wider culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud,” he said.
The government ordered the report as a result of the East London Tower Hamlets poll scandal.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the current mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found Rahman “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have “led his election campaign on the basis that it was a religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were suspicious or the result of a person voting by acting as someone else.
Sir Eric said evidence of fraud can be found all over the country.
He expressed a special concern about the electoral fraud in the mail vote, in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations on cleaning up the voting system, including proof of identity with an identity card
The report says: “The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elderly, especially in those communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshese backgrounds.
“There were concerns that ... state institutions had ignored such behavior because of racial and religious over-sensitivity.”
Sir Eric submitted 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning political activists from processing voting tickets sent by post to stop the “vote collection.”
The report, which Theresa May is reviewing, also calls for stricter amendments to registrations to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for verifying the identity of voters before voting.
Use a non-losing ink on the finger of the voter so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automated voting by mail.
Prevent political activists from dealing with ready-made votes and envelopes in which the votes are sent.
Let the police put guard chains around the polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to accuse people of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Making photography illegal at polling stations.
Require that only English is used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff adhere to the rule that voters must go to the cop alone.
Sir Eric tells the Great London police force that it is “surprising” that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets incident.
“The arbitration court would be left behind as a result of the numerous corrupt and illegal actions of Lutfur Rahman and his officials,” he said.
He was found guilty on numerous grounds without suspicion, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticized the inefficient “check-in checks” in the city councils’ voting registration offices.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s Tower Hamlets judgment was a wake-up.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as the creator of parliaments, but this worrying and mysterious spread of electoral fraud and the denial of facts by certain groups threatens this good reputation.”
Crazy Kate's cycling duo and other celebrity images shown at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the 2016 Rio Olympics have gone astonished by the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be the impressive twin of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is not the only gold-fighting athlete this summer who can boast of his own famous twin – at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces currently appearing on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men's Archery Team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s twin being found on the bike track, many people online have been quick to point out how one particular archer could be the star Leonardo DiCaprio’s twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men’s archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him appearing frighteningly like the star of The Wolf of Wall Street came to the surface.
And, in fact, becoming aware of the enthusiasm of social media, the archer admitted that he had heard from a childhood that he looked like a Leo.
“I don’t see much similarity, except maybe for the beard,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
“He’s a nice guy, so I think that’s a compliment.”
One of London’s most popular comparisons from 2012 will surely emerge this year: a striking resemblance between British length jumpers Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina is said to be the twin of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefana.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Bigger step in the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the “sporty version” of the Inception actress
Another long-standing comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimov has more than the same actress as Annalynne McCord than browned skin and pale hair, while U.S. team Nathan Adrian reminds fans of “the sporty version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.”
Hard Women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presentation of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity between a couple
One Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site that “other on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
And the American football star and Dexter actress really have incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful wide smile matches the smile of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer “died like a pig”
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s fourth place in the message of women’s 4x200-meter freedom rage angered viewers on Wednesday on CBC’s live Olympic broadcast.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its reporters said during the race that the 14-year-old Chinese female mascara “disappeared like a bad odor” and “dead like a pig.”
Rapporteur Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started sharing some of his own opinions at the women’s 4x200 meter freestyle messaging final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC’s reporting team to bring “color,” was heard to say, “That little 14-year-old from China was mocking, baby.
He was too eager, disappeared like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.”
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the message at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to capture China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online as they were shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC reporter just say that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer ‘died like a pig’???
The idiot did not realize that he was still on a live broadcast.”
China’s Ai Yanhan was portrayed in the women’s 4x200 metres message final as: “Take that little 14-year-old from China, baby.”
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was sluggish and quick, with many challenging him.
Twitter users didn’t hold themselves back when they heard how careless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist gang.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized in a live broadcast for MacDonald’s comment, saying: “We’re sorry that the comment about the swimming performance was broadcast.
It was a regrettable choice of words, and we regret that this happened.”
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times from people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC subsequently copied and attached an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The company quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made, and that they were sent live.
We took quick action yesterday evening and apologized in a live broadcast to our viewers and our followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron’s comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and regrettable word choice, and Byron is very sorry for the message.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to define his comment by stating that he did not intend it to be interpreted as a personal assault.
“I would like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made last night after the women’s message,” he said on CBC’s Olympic broadcast.
“I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.”
“It may be unnecessary to say that I didn’t mean it disrespectful, and that I’m really sorry.”
Primark customer surprised by a woman who boldly matched her underwear in the middle of the store
Customers didn’t know where to look when a woman disguised herself in the middle of a Primark movement to try out her underwear.
Things didn’t get better because after evaluating what she looked like in her pants, she cut them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued touring and eventually matched four pairs of underwear in a store located at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where a woman matched her underwear and then put them back on the shelf
Meanwhile, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two children in the store, said that after trying out the underwear, the mysterious woman “dressed up again and walked out of the store without buying anything.”
He said, “People couldn’t believe their eyes.”
The woman stood in the middle of the shop floor, took a pair of underwear on display, took off her own socks and underwear, and put on adjustable legs.
“He did not even try to find a remote place for reconciliation; he only stood there without shame.”
“Everyone looked at him when he took off his underwear and obviously didn’t like it because he put it back on the shelf.”
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding that he didn’t like anything he saw, dressed up again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching - or thought of a man who would end up buying the underwear he was matching."
Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone takes home underwear that someone else has tried but hasn’t cleaned up.”
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove the garments after the woman left, which is good.”
“It would be terrible to go home with a new underwear and find that another woman has put it on and stripped it off and hasn’t washed it.”
A spokesman for Primark said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All these products have been removed from sale.”
How to defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to a New York-based Krav Maga Federation grandmaster, Rhon Mizrach, to find out how to deal with gun-shaking robbers in close proximity.
Approached to you either from the front or the back, this video shows how you can pay the attacker on the same scale.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached behind you, you must first turn around to see your attacker and “shape the line of fire.”
You then grab the gun between your elbow and shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Keep hitting your knee in the hip, and as the attacker goes from pain to a kippura, twist the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with the gun, and retreat with the gun directed at him.
If an armed person approaches from the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal will not be able to fire.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, retreat and point him with a gun.
Does it sound difficult?
See in the video how Mizrachi does exactly this.
But remember that if you’re not the great master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright Slyes the Dirtyest Places in Europe for a Travel Guide
A British traveler has posed a serious challenge to his immune system and vomiting reflex by licking some of Europe’s dirtyest and most nocturnal places.
Suffolk-born host and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, sliced a euro banknote, a ring at the Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet wash button, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before scratching each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was in.
However, the experiment, about which a film called The Trail of the Inner Force was made, produced surprising results.
The idea of slitting the train wash button used by thousands of people may seem completely disgusting, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen drawer.
On his journey through Europe, Wright constantly talked to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his arrows left him another bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for testing his intestinal endurance as he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task ranging from the rails of public railway stations to the washing button of the toilet seat actually tested his immune system.
In a film made, he said: “Since childhood, I’ve been quite concerned about my health, and I’ve put all kinds of things in my mouth, from soil, worms, and spicy water.”
He really strengthened his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
In his sample, the photometer had more than 4000 units of reading.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands should be below 60.
But in one Russian public toilet, he refused to slide when the photometer result showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of newly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a tourist film, Following the Inner Force, together with the Finnish dairy maker, Valio.
In the movie, the bride said, “This is almost the worst thing I’ve smelled in the toilet.”
There is nothing more dirty.
I’m not going to hide anything because there’s nocturnal time here.
It was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy maker, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help boost human intestinal bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Director of Snacks, Juice and New Categories at Valio, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and that would at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air and ended up saying, “Let’s call Ian.”
They argue that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Rather than just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell us about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary allows us to tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, director of the documentary, added: “Let’s say it this way: if Ian had flattered some of the things I asked him for, such as the nighttime Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost my respect for him.”
Understoodly, some of the stuff that was licking was easier for Ian, while some were rather tricky.
I’m glad we saved some of those dirty arrows.”
In a 2015 poll conducted by Valion, 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to stomach and intestinal well-being, and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products that have been added to lactic acid bacteria.
A rookie family destroyed a rented house in Saltash, Cornwall, before eviction
The rookie family caused £50,000 in damage to their rental home after being expelled for terrorizing neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of a property in Saltash, Cornwall after being complained about them numerous times.
After they had been forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing company officials stated that the property was in poor condition.
Shooting holes had been made in the walls, floor boards had been torn, waste had been scattered on the floor, and the walls had been crushed with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in a private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, a host for Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid the property could not be repaired.
He said: “This has been a real nightmare for the inhabitants, and I don’t think people should have to live this way.
There are a lot of things to consider here as this property is likely to be known through Cornwall’s less comfortable groups.
This family is notorious, and their name is notorious.”
The couple had three sons who sometimes lived in the property, and police said the family’s horrors included street fights on baseball paintings, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive screaming, quarrelling and cursing.
47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease agreement, received a decision in June for antisocial behavior.
Many of the rooms of the house under threat of demolition were found with old waste.
The property, from which drugs had previously been transferred, the floor boards had been ripped up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street and that police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing forced the woman and her partner out of the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
Relieved neighbors praised the eviction, saying that their lives had become like hell.
One said, “They didn’t care about anyone.”
We lived with their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We’ve seen the police here incredibly many times.
“We didn’t get to sleep this morning.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It’s wonderful now that they’re finally gone.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the rental house.
He added: “It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own and his family’s behavior, as eviction is always the last procedure considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme, and their actions scared the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the courageous members of the community who gave us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbors and send a message that anti-social behavior will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom.
Employees of the housing company must now clean the waste floors surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as weights, supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after admitting his guilt in possession of a class B drug with the intention of distributing it.
He claimed that the money was intended for his son Lee Skeldon's tombstone, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner are living homeless after now staying in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
On the walls of many rooms were graffiti.
Police say they are trying to drive away residents who are mocking their rental rules.
Angela Crow, a police officer in Devon and Cornwall, said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who will continue to mock the rules.
“This is a message for those who think their behavior is without consequences, as well as for those who suffer from such behavior,” he said.
Police in Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior. Police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal frightened when a military jet flew off the beach in hippo low
Solar worship tourists in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force passed by at a very low level.
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that security was not compromised
It was at this moment that the frightened tourists began to get upset when a low-flying jet swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows how a military aircraft came near-contact from sun worshippers on a sandy strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up when they began to understandably worry about the airplane’s sound, even though they did not at first see what was coming to them behind the clouds.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the numerous holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic flyby on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, “It went past twice at a really low level, and at one point it looked like it was crashing into the ground.”
Nuno Arroja added: “I was surfing and it really felt like a plane was crashing on me.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane emerged from the dark and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight intended to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the aircraft had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby landfires, but the Air Force assured that no one’s safety was at risk.
This summer, wildfires have devastated parts of the Portuguese mainland and have killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly in low-visibility conditions due to smoke from landfires and thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
First quarter results better than expected
The Social and Health District of South Karelia (Eksote) achieved a better result in January – 3.4 million euros in June than planned.
The exo result was a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has managed to dismantle institutional care.
Treatment was carried out in all areas.
This year, Exote aims to reduce the range of measures.
The exotic excess covers the previously created deficit.
The surplus may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The entire year’s result is expected to be 4.6 million euros better than planned.
The exotic board will discuss the half-year report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border doctors swore military oath in Imola
Seventy officers of the Border and Coast Guard School swore their military oath on Friday.
The military ceremony of the gardens of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Helicopter Course was held in the sports field of the garrison.
He was sworn by 70 soldiers.
Specialist border doctors are trained for demanding border management, intelligence and combat tasks.
They served for 347 days.
This year, 310 young people have applied for special border doctors.
250 of them were selected.
Special border doctors have been trained in Imola since 2007.
At the meeting, five veterans of the border troops during the war were involved.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A little bit of a thief ahead - criminal investigation helps in the investigation of crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 police offices in Finland has had a Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit (RTA) since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The unit includes a total of four police officers in Lahore and Hämeenlinna.
It is carried out by a colonel in the Bay.
He serves as commander in Lahore.
In addition, the strengths of the unit include a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone is working in the civil sector.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports to the other police.
This includes, among other things, information about asylum seekers.
The most recent workplace reform
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform in the way police work.
The goal has been to prevent crimes, i.e. the fact that the police are increasingly rarely going out and ringing only when they receive an alarm.
With the data collected and analyzed by the unit, daily police activities are directed to where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence center was established in the country, under three national units, and each police institution had its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR-Center, which operates in connection with the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, manages the activities nationwide.
In the PTR units, according to their name, people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard Department work.
RTA units, in turn, work in areas divided by police agencies, and their task is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond the territory.
Whereas the individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour work shift, the RTA unit’s task is to know what is happening in the entire area of the police station.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of the institution itself, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
With the help of registers, a database of alert missions and observations, the unit seeks to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called sequencing, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
Everyone has their own way of acting.
The fingerprint is also visible in the work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the behavior, a certain type of image is formed.
The sorting can be done either by act or by person depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
RTA employees do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public.
Both the methods used by them and the criminals are not, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus striving to prevent the police’s attempts to combat crime.
The police will publicly report the methods if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
Such a case was from the beginning of the summer, for example, the method of marking empty apartments used in housing robberies.
In it, the perpetrators placed a stick, a knot, or a piece of tape on the outer door of the apartment, with which they tested whether the residents were really traveling.
The preliminary investigation material shall be public at least to the parties concerned.
The Analysis Unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The smartest people order the district court’s minutes, from which it can be shown, for example, that fingerprints have been found on the spot.
Next time, the thieves will take the gloves in hand.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppä Hämeen from the police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärve from the Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Inspector Arto Tuomelaa from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyze information to plan practical actions.
A decrease in the amount of workforce and funding.
The first steps toward a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
Within the framework of national cooperation, information is collected outside the boundaries of the institution and Finland.
London schoolgirl killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, hasly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said the girl's family heard about her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News on Thursday that the girl was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike at Raqqaan, the organization’s base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to his family, he died just planning to flee a war-torn country and return to Britain.
“We can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a graveyard and a testament to others that going to the war zone involves real risks – that it could cause people to refrain from making such a decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family were told that she had married a ISIS fighter in Syria and that she became a widow only a few months later.
Reid says Clinton will consider Garland a candidate for Supreme Court if he is elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is confident that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland’s confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect a person to replace the late Supreme Court member Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a telephone conference on Thursday that he predicted with “a certain degree of certainty” that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid’s spokesman later said he hadn’t spoken to Clinton directly about whether or not he would nominate Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton’s team’t want to “shake the boat” with a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination are the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "hugs" and "enablers".
He said Trump is not suitable for office.
Treats says the naked calendar is “for women as well as men”
The Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to publish a 1970s Pirell-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they plan to find the next-generation top model in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats Chairman Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine, full of nude pictures, is different from the old school Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do this for women.
He thinks the calendar is for him.
“We need to begin again to present timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the naked female body,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can leave pictures via the network or personally at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl’s destination: who actually buys the records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you rush to fill out the comment section with annoying insults by the authors of the nickname NoAllSinglesMale of Middle Ages, please note that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much-talked new arrival of records is not due to the increasing number of people born in this millennium enthusiastically enthusiastic about the novelty of physical objects, but the middle-aged cataracts.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl plate are most likely 45-54 years old.
In fact, of all the most unlikely to buy records belong to the age group of 18-24.
It’s not just a collection of enthusiasts, but also an emotional feature: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to hold their emotions (56 percent vs. 53 percent) and enjoy being alone (69 percent vs. 66 percent).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit.
Let us examine this more closely.
Meanwhile, with Soho’s charm and dirt slowly being removed – hotels, chain restaurants and stores, as well as office supplies stores now filling buildings that previously had independent stores – a handful of stunning specialized record stores are still left behind.
For the next episode, I’d probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment as I’m standing very close to different men in some of these shops trying to judge by observing their age and emotional temperament.
Glasgow’s Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably twenty), spends her afternoons in London for the sake of meeting, and runs around the shops to spend a few hours.
I wonder if he is a collector.
“I am,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which appear in the picture above (she sent a sample by email, I didn’t follow her home), cover the walls of her living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of records and singles is partly a result of his available income: now he can buy records he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can re-buy those he sold when he was young and money-free.
“A lot of the material I bought was from the late 60s and early 70s, records that were released when I was 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to get,” he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding, “I don’t smoke or drink a lot.
This is my evil.”
25-year-old Wez, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers she encounters fit into YouGov’s profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by media enthusiasm. people who have heard that records have come back to fashion and who have come to need to buy their old records back.
Based on my conversations, people have been getting rid of their collections usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy them back,” he says.
This can explain the increase in the number of vinyl rashes for a certain age.
But what about the alleged recording?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community for like-minded types.
According to Wez, some older customers have been hurt by the near-payment system.
Some vinyl fans may get distracted from the digital world and choose to rely on the durability of familiar disc covers; objects that evoke memories of their happy days as teenagers.
“I think that sometimes it can be about filling a gap or some kind of comfort created by owning objects,” Wez says.
As a collector, I also acknowledge that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It’s an easy way to fill your thoughts.
“We are like their social workers!” another worker suddenly said from the plate.
A April poll conducted by ICM revealed that 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of vinyl buyers don’t have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably seem seriously concerned as I browse through the pile of bossa nova collections.
This “reward” aspect of awakening is something that Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, has also noticed.
“Someone came in a while ago and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
This is not a large proportion, but it definitely happens.
More products, less music.
We have people who say, “I don’t have a recording player.”
Not the older ones, but the younger ones, the late ones, who are just enthusiastic about it.
In Fopp, where today there is almost an entire floor reserved for vinyls, there is a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventy couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previously mentioned moves – from speakers to Wild Beast’s fresh synth and sex-filled pop, rather than improvisational jazz – it’s great to see a variety of customers.
None of them appear to be lonely, but it’s hard to prove the proliferating psychological trauma to be true by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Fopp for a few minutes watching the various records on sale.
He is doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn’t make much money, so collecting records isn’t really an option.
“It is expensive.
It’s easy to listen to music either on a computer or something else, but the beauty of the vinyl is...” she whispers in love.
“I don’t know how to explain it – it’s really unique.”
My last stop is said to have aroused a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While trying to look like I’m exploring jeans, I’ve observed a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid cameras for a moment before the father and daughter are considering buying Crosley’s disc player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - because they are just ornaments, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
They are purely “art vinyles.”
But considering that even the slightest attention received by these items can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho crawlers to pick up more, there is not much to complain about here.
It is not surprising that those who are more likely to have more time and money are also the ones who spend the most on luxury items such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
They don’t spend their Thursday mornings modeling around the Berwick Street record stores browsing records and avoiding the scary, 30-year-old TV producer’s gaze over the shoulders of his unhealthy middle-aged men.
The Holker is the longest-lived vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the holker has a longer life span than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who has studied the shark, says that the record is in a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five meters tall.
French court rejects request to dismantle Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a request from the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, which houses thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais prefect’s office argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent a non-tax co-economy and because they pose fire and cleanliness risks.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that the free meals offered by the state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing population in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free meals to those in need.
The court in Lille ordered that there were no legal grounds for the dismissal of 72 people running temporary shops, but said that the Prefect’s concern was “fully understandable.”
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much larger role than just feeding people who “lived in extreme uncertainty.”
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat was the Jungle Book Kids’ Cafe, a non-profit camp that serves 200 meals a day, classes of English and French, as well as refugees for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect children’s cafes.
A letter sent to the Guardian said the closure of the café “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.”
Two charitable organizations, Help Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp has risen to 9,000 – the peak list – after the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices in Finland are falling faster than the EU average.
Food is falling sharply in Finland to the joy of consumers and to the anger of producers.
In Finland, the price of food has dropped by almost five percent in three years, compared with an average of 0.9 percent in the EU countries.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one percent more expensive.
Over the past three years, food prices in Finland have fallen the second most in those EU countries with a salary level similar to that of Finland.
Only in the UK food prices have fallen faster than in Finland.
The data appear from the article by Statistics Center’s development manager Ilkka Lehtinen, which was published on the Tieto & Trendit blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportionate to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
In the early 1990s, food prices increased sharply.
In 2013, prices were close to the 1994 level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then there was a turnaround, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
Russia has imposed a ban on food imports, which has halted food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of dairy and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and the producer prices in agriculture have fallen.
“Putin’s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
The increased price competition between industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Both S-Group and Kesko have lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a place for cheap food, even though the price of food has dropped considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive of the EU countries, with a salary level similar to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, VAT significantly affects the price of food sold in Finland.
He found that if the neighboring countries had the same VAT rate, Finland would sell the third cheapest food in the countries with the same salary level.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in food prices, we will keep the VAT half the average level of the EU countries and continue the price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations on the VAT rate are indicative.
The school is no longer the same.
When you return to the school bench, you may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been prepared for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
This is a standard that is implemented in all Finnish schools.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of fine writing is abandoned, and instead coding is practiced in schools.
Swedish teaching begins at the latest at sixth grade, and social teaching begins at four.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
Previously it was thought that the teacher teaches the students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
In this way, we try to make school more interesting.
The world’s oldest vertebrate has been discovered, it can live up to 400 years.
Somniosus microcephalus reaches sexual maturity only at the age of 150 years.
It could survive another 250 years after that, a new study reports.
The numbers make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is only surpassed by the Islanders, whose oldest known individual is dated to 507 years old.
Greenland is floating along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
The females stretch longer than the dogs, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Because the growth rate is slow, according to observations only about a centimeter per year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He identified two adult ice sharks from 28 females left in fishing gear.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radio-carbon testing of the glasses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493-cent and 502-cent Amatsonian, were found to be approximately 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that ice sharks only reach sexual maturity when they are over a square meter old, the researchers estimated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann launches 300 employees, sales are not reduced
Nearly 300 employees are fired from Stockmann.
The cooperation with the company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
“As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs will be cut, most of which will be carried out in the form of redundancies,” Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of sellers in the warehouses will not be reduced so that customer service will not suffer.
In addition, approximately 80 employees of support functions will be offered a new job as vendors.
Stockmann’s OTC negotiations involved approximately 3,000 employees.
At the start of the project, the reduction needs were estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population is aimed at annual cost savings of approximately 20 million euros, which are expected to be realized in the coming year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency program that aims to savings of €50 million this year.
The backdrop is Stockmann’s difficulties in making goods-house trade profitable.
Although the Group’s adjusted revenue improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the commodity-house trade is still losing.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, CEO of Stockmann, sales in warehouses have not reached the company’s targets.
“Unfortunately, personnel cuts are necessary in order to ensure a positive business result for Stockmann Retail in 2018,” Veijalainen said in a statement.
The second quarter’s revenue improvement was driven by the good success of Lindex.
The chain achieved the best turnover and results of the second quarter of all time.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by 9.5 million euros to 28.1 million euros.
At the same time last year, Stockmann Group’s total operating profit was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s turnover this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted business result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday will be the most rainy in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius across the country
The low-pressure center on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There will also be rains in the central part of the country, but there will be drizzle in the south.
The temperature is no longer very summer, as mercury remains below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
In the northern regions rainfall remains at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's sports team is shaken by a doping scandal - strange explanation for the coach's capture
Kenyan sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The news agency AP that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, head of Kenya's national team, said Anzrahi's identity was revealed after he had given a surprising sample of Rotichin.
Doping officials went to report to the Anzrahi authorities.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home because he "committed crimes against the Kenyan national team."
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed documents.
We cannot accept such behavior," Kenyan Olympic Committee Chairman Kip Keino told Reuters.
The Olympic athletics start on Friday, and Rotichin is scheduled to run at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year and is one of Rio’s favorite winners.
According to Reuters, a source within the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah was using an athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the village.
When anti-doping officials encountered him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him for a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid of revealing himself," the source said.
Where are they all?
The Rio Stadium is empty.
Where are they all right?
Not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio.
In Rio, the fight for medals began on Friday, but the world’s top individuals were allowed to showcase their skills to a confusingly empty audience.
Rio’s organizers said on Friday that only 58 percent of tickets for the first morning games and 65 percent of tickets for the evening games have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was blown up by a crowd.
Tickets have already been sold out in Rio.
The Olympic Games in Rio have already attracted attention.
For example, thousands of empty benches have appeared in the auditoriums for rugby, melon and horse riding.
When Brazilian medallists Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach ball in the legendary Copacabana, the audience was only 70% full.
After the Brazilian duel, the Netherlands played against Russia, with about 30 percent of the 12,000 spectators filled.
The bad progress is at least explained by the fact that Brazil, struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians accustomed to football.
However, even the first game of the Brazilian football team did not pull the stadium full.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the organizers, said that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at the time, a significantly lower figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million ends to sell," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
Ticket prices in Rio have ranged from around nine euros to over 1,000 euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
Volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats at the London Olympics, but in Rio, this is not yet allowed because the organizers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, the organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren for less-known sports such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty spaces in Rio this morning.
Even the beach balloon on the sand of Copacaba has not interested the public.
He competed in London in 2012.
People in the newspaper were enough.
A new way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in the conservation of nature by new means.
The foundation, which was established last year, will acquire ecologically significant natural areas.
Subsequently, individuals, companies and entities can redeem ownership rights in the land with money.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land area is divided virtually into blocks, which those who wish can acquire the right of ownership for a fee.
The owner receives a veto right on its 187 square square blocks, which means that no approval from each holder is required if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holding rights can also be acquired for several blocks.
The acquisition of control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don’t have to go and carry banners or tie yourself somewhere to protect nature,” justifies Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right to own his company.
The owner receives accurate location information from his block, which allows for example a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the names of those who acquired ownership rights are displayed on the same map where the land area data can be found.
Leviäkangas sees its nature conservation procurement as a risk only that the foundation’s activities will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation was established as a public utility foundation with the purpose of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation will act somehow unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect natural areas so that they can be intact and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by purchase or donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the fund is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims to go beyond Finland’s borders and plans to procure land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Trade Center on August 13-19.
Bicycle thieves torment Turku worst of the big cities - look at the situation in your home town
Bicycle thieves are the most affected cities in Finland.
More bicycles were stolen this year than in nine other major cities.
Based on the bicycle theft to the police, the Helsinki Sanomat investigated the amount of bicycles and their parts stolen per 1,000 inhabitants in the ten largest cities in January-August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police, there were four to five bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants.
In Esbo and Kouvola, however, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were to the police.
That is a big difference.
“In other cities, there are twice as many robberies as in other cities in proportion to the number of inhabitants,” says Tommi Reen, police inspector at the Police Government.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the list.
It is very difficult to say why more bicycles have been stolen in the Marketplace than elsewhere.
I have no answer to it.
“The frequency of theft can be influenced by how much people move on wheels in the city and how many wheels there are at all,” says Lieutenant Lieutenant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen of the police government believes that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu are expected to rise to the top in the comparison.
The numbers of bicycle thefts vary greatly depending on the study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense centre, short distances and plenty of bikes available for thieves.
“Esbo, for example, is a different type of city, where the city centers are far apart and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transportation,” Reen says.
In all of Finland, the police are aware of slightly fewer bicycle thefts in January-August than in the same period of last year.
There is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police are aware of a little over 20,000 bicycle thefts each year.
That means 50-60 fillers every day and about 4,000 bicycles a year in Helsinki alone.
“These are huge amounts,” Reen says.
In reality, the thieves take even more bikes, as only a fraction of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to file a criminal report on bicycle theft, although fewer than one in ten cases to the police survive.
A typical investigated bicycle theft is one in which the police are informed of the theft immediately and the thief is caught with his blood.
"Cases will also be cleared in the context of other investigations, when, for example, stolen bikes can be found in the apartment in a drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves are caught weekly for the crime itself or in connection with a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen from shopping malls, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars, i.e. practically everywhere where they are usually stored.
Of the individual bicycle models, the most are stolen in Jopo, as in previous years.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bicycle for short-term use, for example, but a large proportion of the stolen bicycles end up being sold, for example, via the internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
“At least the police have not been informed that the stolen bicycles would go abroad,” Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of the stolen bicycles are ordinary Finns.
Some buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bicycle must be careful, as he may commit a crime of concealment or violation.
“Alarm bells should sound if a well-contained bike is sold at a clear discount,” Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special library officer, always carries his colorful Nopsa during his working day to the shelter of the Kallio library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but none has been stolen, Hirvi tells him, "I have never been taken away, I have been a good monk."
"Per this is not so attractive to thieves, there is not necessarily a hysterical value here," Hirvi of Helsinki thinks.
Siiri Valve, who was quick at a kiosk in Helsinki’s Kallio, locked his bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now the wheel has struck the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks his wheel in something fixed, such as a wheelchair.
“You have to think about it a lot, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own,” says a student from Helsinki about his white bike, whose body alone cost about five hundred euros.
“I always hear from my friends that the wheel has been taken away.”
“Mostly bad bikes, such crap bikes.”
A motorcycle was stolen from his home a year ago.
The bike was unlocked, so Valve could wait for it to be seized.
Children under the age of 15 are liable for their crimes.
Helsinki is testing peer-to-peer teams from the United States
In Helsinki, a so-called peer-to-peer jury team is being tested to prevent young people from falling into the criminal circle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to persons under the age of 15, who are now left without criminal liability.
The first crime committed by a young man is missing.
The idea is that the peer-to-peer jury will discuss the crime with the perpetrator and impose a penalty.
A week later, the perpetrator can join a peer-to-peer jury to compensate for his offence.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says the model is not strict.
There are other methods that are used in parallel.
“Everything is directed in a more responsible direction so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake,” Laitio says.
A model has been taken from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, the young person does not face an adult panel, but reflects on what happened with approximately the same age.
The model has been tested once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at the service design agency Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that it was a mistreatment that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of children under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
“It’s been a message to continue on your chosen path,” Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer team is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is backed by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasizes that new approaches are offered to all in need, not just to immigrant youth.
More than 70 Republicans want to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was by the American newspaper Politico, which had received it to see the draft.
The letter was addressed to Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party’s money to go to Congress instead of Trump’s campaign.
“We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, along with his disregard, incompetence and record-breaking disappointment, threaten to bring the Democrats to the vote in these elections,” the letter said.
Just directing all possible funds immediately to Congressional elections could prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor in their neck.
The letter says the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico says the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizers of the letter is prominently Trump-anti-Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said the letter came from "people who want the party to protect their majorities in Congress" and is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for American children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I aim to be president so that the U.S. economy goes well for everyone.
“Donald Trump is aspiring to be president so that the economy goes well for him and his friends,” Clinton said in a speech.
At the heart of Clinton’s plan is a massive $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure – roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases for the wealthy, partly by private money.
The construction program is a handshake for American duuners who suffer from factory shifts to countries of cheap labor.
Clinton called it the largest investment in well-paid jobs since World War II.
We have to build, we have to build.
Clinton said it.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the situation of working children.
Sanders said on Thursday that the rich should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if a company leaves the U.S. as a tax evasion, it will have to pay the starting tax, Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
"As [President] I oppose any trade agreement that acts against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculations released by the Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize Republican Donald Trump's economic program on Monday for "favoring only this type of millionaires."
Clinton has previously called Trump’s proposed reduction of corporate taxes a “trump hole.”
Clinton said on Thursday she was the daughter of a small businessman.
He reminded audiences about small whose bills Trump has left unpaid, and about clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America,” Clinton said.
These are the spectators numbers in Rio: the tournaments have not glued the Finns to the boxes, but the mobile app is interested
Typically, sports glasses appear in television viewers' statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached a huge number of viewers.
At one time, 12% of the population adhered to the screen at their best: 615,000 viewers watched YLE’s Olympic channel TV2 swimming on Tuesday night at the same time.
For comparison: a month ago, the European Championship in general sports attracted 800,000 viewers at a time on TV2, while the European Championship in football attracted just over two million.
The Olympic sports have so far been most interested in Sunday night cycling and rack gymnastics, which opened the fifth day of the competition, both of which reached the Olympic channel at a time almost half a million spectators.
Panu Pokkinen, head of Yle Sports, is pleased with the number of spectators, and reminds that for the first time at the Rio Olympics, the spectators will be divided into several different instruments.
In addition to watching the Olympics on television, Finns will also watch the Olympics from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much TV viewers choose the Olympics at all.
On the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions to own an entire canal.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are 20,000 to 500,000 viewers all the time, that is a good base.
The number of spectators is smaller than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of the Rio Games broadcasts are in Finland at night time.
Another reason for the lack of interest – if someone thinks it is a dilution now – is a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken someone’s surprise medal from the first tournament, the interest would have jumped up with it.
In addition, general sports are just beginning, as are other species of interest for Finns: sailing and horse riding.
The initial number of spectators has been close to what was expected.
When the show starts, the spectators explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the competitions, which rose in the first days of the competition to be the most downloaded free app in Finland on the Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I’d bet we’re already going to get 200,000 downloads.
“We’ll only get the audience numbers later,” Pokkinen said.
Rio Arena has not worked with all users as hoped.
Pochkin says the feedback has arrived and the errors have been corrected.
The launch of the Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the initial phase.
There are updated versions of the applications that should fix the errors.
The Rio Olympics are seen on the YLE channels and in the arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
Some species can be followed on the Yle Fem channel, and Yle Puhe broadcasts competitions on the radio every day.
The Olympics are not only the hardest ever, but also the last to be watched only on the YLE channels.
Starting in 2018, the Olympic Games will be broadcast on both YLE and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, with a depth of 95.3 meters on the Ristinsel.
It may be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical diving trainer, discovered at Ristisel a gravity of about 20 square meters, the depth of which the diving computer showed was 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environmental Agency tried in vain to confirm the observation by using noise screening.
The method may not necessarily find a small depth of a hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Over 80 meters are Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi.
They have not been studied as thoroughly as the Trends.
In particular, the bottom of the Inari lake has not been accurately mapped.
“There could be unknown deep roads,” Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
Looking at this way, your Days will not get into the top ten, and your Suge Water is even further from the top.
Repair on August 12 at 14:29: Corrected the last piece, where the deepest lakes of medium depth were wrong.
The tax rate for pensioners continues to be tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still tighter than the taxation of wage-takers.
Ihalainen says that the misconduct came to light during the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to the salaries.
This is not included in the government’s proposal.
We think that should definitely be so.
The promises made should be fulfilled after the elections, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, employees received reductions in their income, which eased their taxes.
The case was heated in parliament by representatives of the opposition, who defamed the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubbia (collectively) on his election promises.
Buying power does not grow.
According to Ihalainen, in the line-up presented by Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (collective) on tax cuts, it is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, because next year wages will not be raised.
He says that tax cuts will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (center) and Orpo about the desire to respect the competitiveness agreement that has been achieved with hard work.
He says keeping up with the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy of the government.
It is done by the forces of the labour market organisations, so it should not be stumbled upon by questioning.
It comes to necessity because the economy is so much dependent on domestic demand and people’s own belief in the future.
prolonged unemployment
Mr. Ihalainen calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget debate, at least in order to stop its growth.
There were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed in June than a year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72 percent will fade.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline in the permit.
Embassy: There are no casualties in the attacks in Thailand
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be careful and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to travel to Thailand do not have a reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
There are very few people in Thailand.
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand dates back to the end of the year.
The majority of tourists to Thailand come from Southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finnish citizens in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has sought to reach Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to get information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contact persons in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
Overall, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
Westphalen said the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
The ambassador believes the events may be linked to the political unrest in a divided society in Thailand and the last week’s referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed by referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country, among others, people were arrested who said they opposed the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand there is, in turn, an ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
The city celebrates the Queen’s birthday and Mother’s Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about security.
Thailand Police: Attacks are not international terrorism
The police said the attacks were "local sabotage" and differed from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also ruled out, according to the Thai news agency AP.
At least four people have been killed in Thailand after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including at tourist attractions in Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded on the holiday island of Phuket in the middle of the night, according to the Bangkok Post.
According to current data, there were no casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded at Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Ngata, injuring one person, according to the newspaper.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs exploded in the popular tourist destination of Hua Hin yesterday and today.
Both bombings killed at least one person.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in both the towns of Surat Than and Trang in southern Thailand.
In both attacks at least one person was killed.
Surat Thani is also well-known to many tourists, as it is transported to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The attacker is unknown.
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the ruling military junta in Thailand, said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn’t get people to panic anymore, he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister for Security Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said at least the attacks by Hua Hin and Trang were linked.
He told the Thai BSB that the perpetrators intended to destroy the country’s tourism because all of the attacks occurred in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to be careful and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to travel to Thailand do not have a reason to cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the ambassador's instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks and their victims.
Last week’s attack on Hua Hin was.
A local woman was killed and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the injured are German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian citizens.
The attack on Hua Hin injured at least three people.
Two bombs exploded near the clock tower.
Thai PBS that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin, where they believe they have found another bomb.
According to the provincial governor, the Surat Than bomb was hidden in a flower bench.
An employee of the municipality was killed.
There are at least one injured.
A police chief told CNN that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded about every half an hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's quarterfinals
U.S. Alexandra Raisman was second with 60,098 points and Russian Alija Mustafina was third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still seeking to win the championships in the Rio Games with permando, jumping and booming.
Biles has dominated women’s gymnastics to a considerable extent in recent years.
He has won eight personal world championships in the previous three seasons.
He has won the championship three times in a row, and the boom last year and last year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has achieved two world team championships.
Lower MM medals in Biles have jumping and booming.
Finnish entrepreneur: "The storm has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children’s play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the bombings in Thailand on tourism.
If there are no more strikes, I don’t think anything more miraculous will follow from this, says Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia for about a couple of decades.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen from close many tragedies that have suffered Thailand.
There is always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then bird flu, and last year there was a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If they didn’t drive out tourists, they probably didn’t.
Huovila’s office is located a few hundred meters from the scene of the explosion.
He heard the attack from his own officer.
The employee called around nine a.m. local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila said both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought it was for the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says, referring to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open around 10 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
At half three o’clock in the day, the traffic in Patong was normalized and most of the shops had opened their doors.
According to the scene, the explosion was relatively small, Huovila, who visited the scene, said.
Later that car was seen in Crounupy on the Jouxholminti road.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
The patrol found two men suitable for the signs hiding in a nearby seat.
The other man was immediately caught.
The other man fled, but was later found in the forest with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of motor vehicle theft, theft and serious injury.
The police thanked those who gave the clues.
Research Director on Leadership Change in Russia: Clear Displacement
Russia's highest-ranking executive shift in years took place on Friday, when President Vladimir Putin removed his head of government, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov’s successor is the 44-year-old Estonian Anton Vaino.
He is a former diplomat and served as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov’s resignation may be Putin’s desire to prevent the strong people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that the recycling of leadership positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way to prevent people from accumulating power independent of the president for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has gotten into quarrels with other senior executives or has been messed up.
Destruction of Ivanov
Ivanov, one of Putin’s inner circles, will be transferred to special roles in environmental and transport affairs.
In a video broadcast by state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested to be transferred to other positions and suggested the Persecution to replace him, Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s perspective, this is a clear downturn.
Environmental and transport issues are not very important in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most prominent people at the top of Russian power.
Ivanov has also played an important role in the President’s Security Council.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev took over as president.
Kangaspuro points out that old cards, such as governors, have recently been exchanged in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi of the Foreign Policy Institute says that what is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s post is that Putin changes his neighbors to younger ones.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields in Syria
They used civilians as human shields as they fled to the city of Jarabulus so that we’t target them,” said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the civilians were placed in hundreds of cars in which they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters seized about 90 percent of the Islamic State’s city of Manbij.
It is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city.
Corrected from the previous news at 19:30: We previously mistakenly that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs publication of documents is illegal.
The Interior Ministry’s policy on the publicity of documents is unlawful, says Tomi Voutilainen, a professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that the publicity of documents cannot be based on the authority’s own guidelines, but it is based on the law.
Earlier, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over the participant list of the Ministry of the Interior’s events to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with the guidance of the State Council Chancellor and with the fact that the information was recorded in the calendar of the Minister and not in the accounting material.
The Communications Director of the Ministry tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic performance begins in Rio de Janeiro
As in recent years, Bolt has been running against time.
He broke his back in the beginning of the season and was forced to miss the Jamaican Olympics.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in a much better shape.
I’ve practiced well and that’s the key,” Bolt said at a news conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed sambata dancers and fans-converted journalists.
Porina around Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when sports have struggled with doping scandals and slippery interest.
Bolt’s last defeat at the 2004 Olympics was in Athens, where he scored the first 200 meters at the time of 21,05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that was slowed down by injuries and loose training posture.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred meters, with which he broke the world record and the self-confidence of the competitors in spite of the final celebration in a time of 9.69.
This is more difficult
A year later, at the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt reached the top of his career by measuring the clock.
The world records of 9,58 in a hundred meters and 19,19 in a two hundred are still in place.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is striving for a 200-meter world record and a 19-second undercut, but no one but Bolt himself believes in it.
Bolt’s biggest challenger is Justin Gatlin, who won the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.
In the final of the World Cup in Beijing last year, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his tenure in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the World Cup finals.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th World Cup final was missed by Bolt due to a fraudulent start.
Bolt will be 30 in a week.
He is an old man in the young men's race, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt’s final goal line will be next year’s World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that distinguish me from others.
I’m older and it’s harder.
But whenever I’m underground, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping abuse
Chinese state news agency Xinhua that 18-year-old Chen Xinyi gave a positive doping test at the Rio Olympics.
Chen Xiny's doping sample contains traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenyan sports coach was passed home because he gave a doping test on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of an epo-hormone.
In Rio, she finished fourth in the women’s 100 meters butterfly race.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese champion has brought his doping case to the International Court of Appeal for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua said a sample given by Xiny on Sunday found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Additional doping allegations have been revealed.
The Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo-hormone.
Kenya has banned a sports coach from Rio de Janeiro for doping.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete during the test and had given a doping test for him.
According to media reports, the victim is Kenyan fast-trainer John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he used the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich’s pass.
Phelps are not stopped by anything - historic gold came into the show style
The most successful athlete in the history of the Olympics, the American Michael Phelps, swam in the 200 meters mixed with his 22nd Olympic victory.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic medals.
Phelps was the first swimmer to win Olympic gold in four consecutive competitions.
Phelps’ winning time was 1.54.66.
Japanese Kosuke Hagino was second in the mixed match ahead of Chinese Wang Shuni.
I just try to have a little fun, BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs in an instant interview with Iltalehti.
Helen Skelton’s story on Monday is one of the most read stories on Iltalehti’s website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t get much stress if there’s a little noise in the Finnish or British press about his revealing and peculiar dresses.
Television is a visual medium, he said.
Skelton is wearing high-heels shoes and a short-heels dress that is sure to have at least enough revelation – at least for the eyes of many conservative British spectators.
However, reversal is not allowed.
It’s important to look good, and small scales are just fun.
Skelton wants to tone and even get upset, but he emphasizes that he doesn’t want to be in the main role.
It’s not about me, he says.
We are watching sports, and the focus must be on the athletes.
It doesn’t matter how I dress.
Can you imagine that it has reached Finland?
I can’t, but anything that draws attention to how hard these swimmers work and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me.
Do you know what?
It's a whisper from scratch if it comes from dressing (the leader).
I’m so excited if someone has hit me like that.
Rio police arrest two people on terror suspicion
Rio police said on Thursday they had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
Police arrested them in the course of the contest.
Police also arrested five others and interrogated two people before they were released.
All the suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, the people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were arrested by police in July.
The detainees are believed to have links to the Islamic State group.
The suspects allegedly incited violence on social media.
Messages calling for violence were spread, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
There are 85,000 police officers in Rio.
Police explode suspicious package in Rio de Janeiro
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of the Rio Basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in a basketball arena and locked it from the public.
The police let the public in after controlledly detonating the package.
This is the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled explosion.
Police closed the area due to a suspicious package.

Argentine lady kicks Petäjä-Siren - Finnish thought about protest
It was a colorful competition in Rio.
The wind was heavy on Thursday.
An Argentine lady dressed the Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday at the opening of the women's surfing day in Rio.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the violation.
He was stuck because of the crash, and the others fled, Finland’s head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete long thought about protesting.
It was not necessary to do so because it would have been ineffective according to the Olympic Rules.
I should have fallen into the water in order to get compensation, Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hanged on his board until the end because he didn’t want to get into Rio’s dirty water.
The Finnish team left in 27th place.
In total, the 2012 Olympic Olympics in London are eighth.
At the top, it did not have much impact.
Friday is an important day for the 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 things that, according to science, prolong life
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to add additional years to a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life is prolonged.
Sometimes things that a person cannot control can bring them additional years.
These include a tendency to average obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong life.
You don’t have to worry about it, just picking a milk bottle is enough.
The secret of longevity has been investigated through various studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the most strange findings.
According to science, all of these things can add more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Drinking coffee has been found to protect some against cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
A study from Harvard University found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a “reduced risk of death”, especially in the case of neurological or heart-related diseases.
Studies have shown that moderate consumption of one to three daily doses of alcohol may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of a toothpaste can extend a person’s life by up to six years, according to a study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They can contribute to the spread of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found how laughter affects a person’s lifetime.
The seven-year project was followed by more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment.
Sex, when protection against sexually transmitted diseases has been taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
It can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, having sex alone is not enough.
In order for a person to have extra years of life, he must also have an orgasm.
There are years of excellence, that is not to be denied.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute complacency.
In fact, a study from the University of Oxford found that women with a large back had lower cholesterol levels.
Their bodies also had more omega-3 fatty acids.
The same study linked these factors to a lower mortality rate.
Whether it’s an Olympic medalist or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than an ordinary bulldozer.
Many studies have attempted to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring additional years to his life.
Some researchers suspect that longevity is due to a person’s social status – which in turn makes it possible to pursue recognition such as a Nobel Prize.
A study of the shopping behavior of people over the age of 65 found that people who shop every day were less likely to be older than those who shop less often.
This is because rotating in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that can lead to premature death.
So drop your credit card from your hand – therefore, online shopping will not have the same effect.
Drunk driver crashed into truck
On Friday night, there was a serious collision between a truck and a passenger car.
The accident occurred in Koskela, between Koskentie and Sorvastonti on Friday at 21:00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forsa, when the passenger car that came in the face had crashed into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck stood up on the runway, but burned.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The car crashed over the roof and then over the roof.
A woman who was born in 1972 was caught in her car.
The rescue agency removed the injured driver from the car and transported him to the University Central Hospital in Turku for treatment.
The result of the woman’s blow test was 2.02 promiles.
He is suspected of drunk driving.
I sent the mail to the wrong city.
Salon K-Citymarket’s loose cargo range had flaws because the post had accidentally delivered part of the cargo to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose bags at Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product flaws in the bulk, because the Post delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We will get more when the mail gets delivered!
If you don’t go into the barrel, you read it on the label.
The dealer’s foxing sign is linked to the fact that Posti last spring expanded its services to include grass-cutting.
The grass cut is on the supply of the Post until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly funny and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update struck me with amazement.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention that this matter has attracted is incredible, Haltia wonderes.
On Friday night, Haltia’s update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got his own favourites caught in a loose bag, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is in charge of the business of Post's Enterprise Transport Services, apologized for the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The backdrop is that three of the five stages went to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to make a partial delivery (Saloon) with three, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
This was the first news of the evening.
Teija Haltia was not upset by the label, because she found all her own lookout favorites in the selection.
Lotta Backlund, who lost 30 pounds, posted a photo of her change.
The comedian has gained tens of kilos since the birth of her child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of kilos as a result of a life change.

She has a comprehensive lifestyle change and lost weight slowly by thirty pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a photo of his outstanding performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how enormously Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
The Backlund Before and After photo pair has gathered a number of appreciative comments from fellow exchangers.
You are awesome.
At the same time we are on the road, motivation is strong! one shakes.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do It Now project.
I get tremendous strength and enthusiasm from your photographs when I am on the same road, another tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last pounds with the Do It Now project.
At the time, he told Iltalehd that he wanted to finally reach a normal weight, which was about ten kilograms.
Within three months of exercise, the pounds eventually dropped by five.
The wish of the family of a woman murdered in Lovisa: Victim memories for police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Lovisa a week ago hopes that the victim will be remembered instead of flowers and addresses with a donation for police dog work.
Sibbo Veterinary Station has released an update on Facebook, where it conveys the wishes of the victim’s family for donations to the police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Siboo Veterinary Station and also completed his nurse training there.
The veterinarian station reminds the woman with touching words.
He is happy, intelligent, humorous and not afraid of work.
The good friend.
We still cannot fully understand that he is gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The donation money will be allocated to the police dog, primarily to the purchase of seat belts.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman in Lovisa was murdered in her own yard in Lovisa’s Koskenkylä.
Neighbors said the victim was very animal-loving.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and a cock.
The 27-year-old suspect did not know the woman and had no contact with each other.
In the pursuit of the murderer was involved the police dog Börje, who was injured in the detention situation life-threateningly.
But he survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced the Post for violation of the Equality Law
The Post had no right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to inform a tenant, the Kanta-Hämeen district court assessed in its judgment.
The district court ordered the Post to pay the employee the majority of the salary held and 2000 euros as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Post could have withheld from the remuneration of the instructor only the part that corresponded to the part of the instructor’s work of the whole day.
According to the district court, the employee was placed in a more disadvantaged position on the basis of his trade union activities in violation of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the decision of the Post and Logistics Industry Union of the PAU on the prohibition of informing.
In November last year, the PAU made a decision that Post employees would not inform hired workers who violated the strike.
This was first by People's News.
Turkey to return to respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their reply to the Journalist’s Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (PS) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Earlier, the Union of Journalists asked Sipil and Soin to express concerns about the freedom of speech and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of press and freedom of expression.
Putin removes head of government to replace Estonian leader
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
He is replaced by Karl Vaino’s grandson Anton Vaino.
Perseo is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy chief of the presidential administration since 2012.
He is also a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired his leader.
According to the Kremlin, Ivanov, who is part of Putin’s inner circle, will be transferred to special roles in environmental and transport affairs.
Putin said Ivanov had himself requested transfer to other positions and proposed the Persecution to replace him, Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the Soviet Union for the KGB.
In 2008, Ivanov was considered a possible successor to Putin, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin re-elected in 2012.
BBC: ManU’s giant acquisition to play ban – not to be seen at Premier League opening
The world record transfer player will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League starts this weekend.
Paul Pogba was banned from England.
Manchester United’s giant acquisition Paul Pogba is out of play due to a ban when ManU opens its league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC on Friday.
ManU paid Pogba to Juventus for 105 million euros.
However, the Football Federation of England (FA) has banned him from playing because Pogba was banned from Juventus.
He received two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and it will be a one-match ban.
The ban has been moved to England, FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, great madness is a virtue
The precise criteria for well-being and ambitious visions have established the status of the Flow Festival as an internationally prestigious event celebrated by the world’s top artists.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own clothes.
One of the main artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stylized, among other things, with artworks and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to have only the main lava and the tent, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival, which will be held this weekend in Suvilahti, Helsinki, has grown from a small quarter festival to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The underlying question behind success is simple: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It’s quite unusual for producers to think like this.
Often the goal is to reach the level of necessity and to act in accordance with authority regulations, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be out of sale this year.
The goal was to increase the number of visitors by 5,000 by 70,000 last year.
This year, there will be a lot of interesting local and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing because it needs to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we don’t want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle driven by huge tracks.
We do not want that.
Over the course of 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been inflated in such a way that there are 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurants and drinking bars in the area, which is partially devastated by artificial violence.
In addition to the main stage and the smaller stage, this year there will be a tent for 15,000 people.
He admitted that the process could be made even simpler.
Per I’m a little mad, but at the same time we’ve managed to keep the Flow’s spirit.
If we lose it, it is no longer our business.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even big visions are practically possible today.
In the early years of the event, in the middle of the 21st century, the activity was highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki of approximately 20 000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the stock company that operates Flow was approximately 6 million euros.
It can be used to create “circular things” such as building that 73 meter wide tent.
Flow’s visitors have typically expressed themselves in their distinctive clothes.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as fashionable.
We want to stand out first and foremost in terms of content.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit into Flow’s world of values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main artists on the stage is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge crowd of fans in his genre, but he is not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was kicked off because this is likely to be the last time she is seen on a show in Finland.
We are interested in history and the future.
Not just what is being played on commercial radio.
Iggy’s latest album is fucking good and she has done fucking good performances in the last few years.
Bombs in Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in baskets - tourists fled in horror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 wounded.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a floral basket and exploded with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They exploded at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
Since 1989, wildlife protector Edwin Wiek, who has lived in Asia, tweeted about the attacks.
If the tweet does not appear properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of the injured were foreign tourists.
People ran toward me and said the bomb had exploded near the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Soon after, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket.
No one is known to have died.
At the same time, another double bomb attack occurred in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin, which had not yet exploded.
Thai authorities say there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings, which are dissatisfied with the military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organizations may also be involved.
According to the Aftonbladet, the police have recently seized the activities of criminal groups engaged in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new readiness forces will go to battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, warriors are ordered to engage in combat tasks only after several months of swearing a military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, head of training for the Defence Forces, for example, of the guardsmen who serve for 5.5 months in a war situation are only those who are in the final stage of their training.
According to the head of training, reserve personnel belonging to the readiness forces will be assigned to service first.
No warrior or reservist is ordered for a task that has not received the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier this summer it was revealed that the Defence Forces will start training warriors for immediate readiness units from next year.
Units may, if necessary, be used in military operations already during warrior training.
Pamela Tola receives huge compensation for hometown
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough dispute over the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey separate house had been 330 000 euros.
However, after the sale, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused a health-threatening microbial growth.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sale price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple went to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller disputed the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the district and court.
The court ruled on the matter on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the district court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150,000.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the couple’s trial and settlement costs in the amount of €47,344.
The court justified the price reduction slightly, because some of the need for repair of the apartment had been known to the buyers already when making the housing sale.
However, according to the court, the construction errors that appeared were substantially more serious than what had been proposed.
Looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a well-contained home because they did not want to start repairs.
He had the notion that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there is no harm to the elements mentioned in the fitness inspection report.
The condition inspection report mentioned as risks and inappropriate ventilation and the fact that the control of rain and melting waters flowing along the rocky surface is insufficient.
However, the discussions did not show that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma believed that the rainwater coming from the rock might need to be controlled a little in a few years.
The sale took place in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the apartment were far more serious than thought.
In 2012 and 2013, inspections in the building found a microbial growth, which witnesses said was due both to the rock’s rainwater and capillary moisture.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector’s estimate, also enter the interior through the window.
Mould or yeast, which posed a health risk and exceeded the limit values, was found in sheet samples in the home care room, the staircase in the basement, the window mark of the living room and the basement washing room.
Buildings without permission
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been expanded in violation of the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware before the transaction of the decision of the city of Espoo, according to which the apartment had been subjected to changes contrary to the authorisation.
Among other things, the terraces were built, although the appropriate permits had not yet been obtained.
Homosexuality was a major issue in the court.
According to the Court of Appeal, on the basis of information received from the seller before the sale, buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for large-scale repairs in the near future.
According to the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma did not have any special reason to conduct a wider inspection than usual.
The buyers have not neglected their duty to take the order, the court said in its judgment.
Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to the Nazis, including Finns
In a recent Dagens Nyheter article, journalist Christopher Andersson writes that the National Archives in Maryland has microfilmed documents about a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are Germans, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women sought to become Nazism.
The documents and registration cards are from the racial agency in Nazi Germany.
The racial office was operated under SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true in even greater proportions for women who were supposed to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were undergoing gynecological examinations to clarify the matter.
The Racial Bureau investigated the background of women, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women were also required to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Race Agency handwritten life stories and good recommendations from relatives.
The Race Office wanted guarantees that women were “child-loving”, “sparing” and “good national socialists” who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men’s brides.
The case does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The program, among other things, stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or outside the marriage.
Lebensborn houses take care of children born outside of marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the website of the American Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and supporting children.
The Honour of a German Mother was awarded to women who had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Arians" and "non-Arians" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
In the sixth round, he rose and fell.
Tapio Nirkko placed third in the first departure of the Finnjolli Day at the Rio Olympics, but was the tail jump of the whole group on the second departure of the day.
Nirkko rose in overall position eighth after five departure, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought in the RS:X class day departure for 17th and 3rd places.
Overall, Sirene is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren finished 23rd in the opening start of the day.
Overall, the Lindgren are in 19th place.
Jari Sillanpään Satulinna recorded a couple of hours of night’s sleep: “I was so stuck”
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finnish favorite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who became the tango king of the cruise ship in 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of dance bands and festivals, is still on the lookout.
Mari Koppinen's book Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, which tells the life of the favorite singer, was published today Thursday.
The book tells about his life and career, in good and in bad.
Sillanpään’s career rose to a total rise when he won the tango king’s crown at Seinäjoen Tangomarket in 1995.
In the contest, Sillanpää sang tango, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed for Sillanpäi, at the request of a man, a tango piece, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book tells us that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on the tape in a terrible bump and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so choked!
The bridge is in the book.
From the recording of a huge hit song, you would not immediately guess that it was sung in a crap.
Although I wasn’t physically at my best, the track was still good.
I’ve learned that you don’t have to constantly demand perfection and perfection.
The second coincidence associated with the man’s most popular songs, which is described in the book, happened almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää separated from his then partner and the case eventually ended in the lyrics of the song You Deserve Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
In the book it is stated that the songs ordered by Saara Törmäs were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record telling the true story of his own life, but the words of the song telling the divorce were not true, it was written on the basis of the news of the 7 Days magazine.
In the news of the newspaper, the reason for Jari’s divorce from his ex-lover was Jari’s excessive celebration and alcohol use, but according to Jari, it was a whole joke and it wasn’t true.
According to the book, Jari played in anger at the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and well so.
In June, the British voted to leave the European Union.
In the end, 52 percent of the voters voted in favour of the separation and 48 percent would have remained in the Union, even though polls forecast the opposite outcome.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for the distinction, even though a couple of individual researchers could disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The motto of former US President Bill Clinton’s campaign “It’s the economy, stupid” has been used in the UK’s Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn’t seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics finds the answers to the Brexit catastrophe.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the economists’ explanations for the loss of economic status is that people don’t understand economics.
Many still have the notion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people working, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it’s out of the right British.
Many also have the notion that a decrease in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
According to the Economic Committee, voters did not believe economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently highlighted.
They were especially stunned by the BBC’s impartiality, which gave just as much space to the economists who represented only a few percent of the economy, and to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hateful press was not interested in telling what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economics combinations thought of the consequences of the split.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were not cared for, because economists represent an elite with which voters do not think they have common interests.
Academics in big cities, such as economists, would have remained in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is an economy.
The overwhelming winning argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant takes your job, the immigrant crowds your hospital, the immigrant exploits you.
These arguments have stumbled.
There are foreign workers in every cafe.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
There are immigrants in the waiting rooms of every health center.
How much easier would the British get medical hours if they didn’t have them?
In every school there are immigrant children.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they were removed?
There are foreigners in every town.
How much more space would the indigenous people have if they disappeared?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to answer them, and even if they succeeded, their answers were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centers and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants – and especially EU immigrants – are the net payers of the UK’s public budgets and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepares for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Pertti Vanhanen.
He said Aberdeen had prepared for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, or the victory of the league in favour of the EU, began to be prepared more precisely a few weeks before the vote in case the result would be leave.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but now they may be needed.
We started raising cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid funds, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen’s only open daily listed real estate fund covered by the news.
The average rate is 15-20 percent.
At the time, the fund was worth £3.5 billion.
The company’s assets are worth approximately £20 billion.
That was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at 10 percent or even below it.
Real Estate funds are preparing for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed trade.
When the disengagement camp of the European Union won, Europe became confused.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate traders.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they robbed the situation and brought the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared to the years 2007 and 2008, Oldhanen said.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calm, but private investors remained nervous.
The snowball began to rotate, and one after another the fund had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good position because of the cash collected, but it also eventually had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the price downward.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it was worth taking the money out in panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you are not forced to take your money out now, it is not worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed the situation, and the majority canceled the notification.
Since then it has been quite stable, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Oldhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such turmoil in Aberdeen’s Continental European funds.
There were a lot of inquiries.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
The closure of real estate funds trading has received unreasonable attention.
The open funds affected by the shutdowns control about four percent of Britain’s real estate.
The closure of Aberdeen lasted six days, and the company sold out less than ten properties in 80 of its properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it could keep its funds closed until the end of 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been slashed downward, but the situation doesn’t seem “better” for Aberdeen.
The major questions now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound and the dollar are at their lowest rate in 30 years, and the market has seen a 15% discount in sales compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are a lot of people who want to buy, he said.
Brexit brings down on London’s property market
At two o’clock in the morning, the situation did not seem so strange.
But at four o’clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, head of real estate investments at British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the outcome of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
The force was there.
I realized that this is now going to plan B, Vanhanen says in his other home in Helsinki.
He immediately went to work.
London City was already fully alive despite the morning night.
The TV screens, which were normally silent in the office, produced the news, and the usually loud crowd completely silenced to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stood in front of the camera in the morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened, the display ends blinked red.
It was such a morning that I never thought I would have lived, said the old man.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate deals on the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and therefore the situation was somehow peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Brexit voting starts the reform movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went to change.
The market began to anticipate sharp declines in the UK and especially in the London property market.
Offices in London were expected to drop by up to 20 percent in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began freezing their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did so for six days.
Now the poison has disappeared, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
It does not appear on the face of the old man who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
It is still too early to say what will happen after Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
Early data on the London real estate market has already been obtained.
Property services company CBRE’s data on price developments cover about a third of the market.
Prices for all London properties fell 3.3% from June to July.
In the London City office buildings, the minus was 6.1 percent, Vanhanen lists.
The numbers are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months ago there have been worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All the same declines occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting that Brexit was compared quite quickly to the collapse of Lehman and the global financial crisis that began in the U.S. real estate market.
The comparison is not quite appropriate, as it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
The mood is another.
The real estate market has now seen no panic sales like those of the time, but a willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Financing is normal.
The repair could have been done anyway.
In fact, the price correction movement is not a miracle for him – it could have been without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that real estate prices in London and other world’s top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and the offices are overpriced, Vanhanen says.
The fall started very high.
London prices have climbed up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, as has the population of London.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is globalizing, Vanhanen says.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have entered the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is known as an easy city.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which has forced pension companies, for example, to seek profits from new items.
On top of this, loans have been easily available – although the debt gap has now been used, according to Vanhanen, clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Decentralized and Decentralized
In London, prices increased in the past summer, Oldhanen says.
Aberdeen also started lightening its ownership in London and was a net seller last year.
I expected a turn, and now it came.
What from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Oldhanen says.
He does not dare to say much about the future, but says there is hardly any promise of a rise.
The atmosphere indicates that there is a downward or flat course ahead.
Vanhanen has seen several moves up and down since he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And still he is an optimist who believes that the hole can be overcome by work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, there is too much of its victim.
If decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, says Vanhanen.
The S-Group begins to register purchase data more accurately than before
Soon, the S-Group will know what you eat, as the retail group said today that it will begin to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its regular customers.
Once the information has been collected to date on the final amount of the receipt, the group will begin to collect it from the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S-Group will follow Kesko here, as data on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received on the program has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer’s consent and is used for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have prohibited the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanom.
According to him, Kesko will not react to the change in the registration of the S-Group.
Kesko already classifies its regular customers into 10 groups based on food purchases alone.
The classification is updated monthly.
Standard customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from the K-Group own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and is not planning to do so at this time.
Finland’s Nearby Market has its own First Bonus client program, to which you can join at Selintatalo, Siwo and Euromarkete.
We do not currently collect information on the product or product group level, we will stay at the level of the final amount of the receipt.
That is, we know in which store the purchases were made and on what day, as well as the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to the level of the K group or the S group,” says Anu Ora, Commercial Director.
According to him, it is planned to reform the loyalty program in the future, but Lähkauppa will tell later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
First the experiment
So far, SOK’s client owner and client register has been relatively extensive.
The basic data included not only personal and address data, but also occupation, education, form of residence, as well as children’s birth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their roles are also registered.
The purchase date and time of the purchase, the place, the final amount of the purchases and the method of payment are stored from the S-Premium Card purchase.
In addition, information about S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In contrast, in S-markets, Prisms, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, data is recorded at the product group level so far.
Customers have long hoped that marketing could be targeted more precisely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Owners and Partnerships at SOK.
The S-Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
They may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data will be stored in the box, whether you want it or not.
Anyone who wishes can check their deposited data on the S-Group website.
For example, the casinos do not have access to data, insists Saarikoski.
Video: Heila is the newest dog reinforcement by Tull - the puppy will be the first explosive dog
Black Labrador’s puppy snails five similar boxes in a row at Helsinki-Vantaa airport.
It doesn’t take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila for playing with his favorite toy.
From the box, next to which Heila was sitting, a bottle of stinking shells was revealed.
The straw gas is the first smell that has now been trained with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
The security situation and the main reasons for online trading
Heila is Tull’s first dog specialized in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport next year.
Work tasks may also be carried out to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be the main workplace for Heila, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures in the Customs and after the attacks the control has been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, chief inspector of the Customs.
Another main reason for training a gun and explosive dog for the duties of the Customs are the postal shipments that pass through Helsinki-Vanda.
As the internet trade grows, up to 40 million mail sends pass through the airport each year, including arms and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, the Customs Department of Helsinki-Vantaa Airport has made about 300 discoveries of online shopping, passenger aircraft luggage and air cargo related to weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives and their precursors.
Heila will work across the Helsinki-Vantage.
It will examine recorded luggage and postal shipments.
For ports, it will be of great benefit in the future, as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, the Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg looks forward to the idea.
School in Church
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tull Dog School in Kirkkonum.
Suntio is also training with Heila as a police and Defence Forces expert.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Force has expertise in explosives.
The Customs will decide, together with other authorities, which smells Heila will be taught to recognize.
Heila will always be further trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues in Helsinki-Vantage are Tull’s six drug dogs and money and drug dog Massi.
Heila Labrador was chosen out of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog to be picked up for the airport include agility and hunting abilities, as well as calmness as the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close friend of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
There is no way to go home without the heels, Suntio laughs.
Excellent orders are given to the heels.
The Ilta-Sanomien cameraman loses the microphone cover of the camera to a fast dog, but Heila returns the cover that looks like a soft toy immediately with the "rit" command.
Strong competition for dogs
The initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, where it will be assessed whether the training is sufficient for demanding work tasks.
Heilan can be seen in work tasks in Helsinki-Vantage next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, the passengers can’t come and lick a dog wearing a work jacket, Suntio reminds.
The cost of one working dog is approximately €60,000 to €70,000 per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working hours last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is a tough competition for dog owners.
The company has approximately 20 to 30 employees.
Luckily, Suntie has not had a working dog before, but has years of experience with dogs and supervisory tasks at the Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal - the nation gets a holiday
With fewer than a million inhabitants, Fiji’s rugby Olympic gold is so highly valued in the country that the government has declared August 22 a national holiday.
According to the national broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed this after the championship was settled.
A free day will be held the next day of the team’s return home.
Heroes are also celebrated in their home country.
The Fiji Rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the final was followed in the country’s capital, Suva, where a screen was erected on the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even in Chinese restaurants watching the game, I heard them encourage, Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish lifter drowned after a fierce performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt after a hard fight of 175 kilograms.
Tokol has a special and life-threatening characteristic.
During heavy lifts or immediately after them, he has repeatedly fainted.
No one really knew why.
Tokola received a push of 175 kilograms in Rio and 145 kilograms in a catch.
His combined weight was 320 kilos.
At the end of the day, Tokola tried to gain 175 kilograms, as in the second.
At the third attempt, the weights rose by a loud scream.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The Finnish elevator was delighted that he suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian attacker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Palloseura, which plays in the men's football league, has signed a lasting contract with Estonian attacker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player for our team who has power and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through over 50 players from around the world with over ten player agents.
Slowly from the crowd began to stand out as a good alternative Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flor in Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to be with RoPS on Saturday at Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemen will meet the ruling Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's goalkeeper Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Modern Family star: Teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who starred in the Modern Family comedy series Alex Dunphy, is once again shocked by presenting her threatening body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that do not leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actress's legs, but also his back.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to be much more courageous.
The star has posed in pictures posted on social media in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
The young woman has also been seen wearing very narrow clothes.
Winter, who is on the brink of adulthood, has also recently published several photos of herself celebrating.
If you don’t see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his publicity image so radically.
At the time, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a “typical Hollywood transformation” from a child star to an adult.
She has been on television almost all her life and grew up in the era of the Kardashians.
He’s learned that the more he looks out on the surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood,” Palmer told Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the series Modern Family when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has annoyed some of his long-standing fans with his image change.
It’s not hard to guess where she will be in ten years, when the downturn is already so strong, says one woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the female fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge not to care about criticism.
You look great!
Same as what others say.
You’re an inspiration for many women, shines a young woman.
Japanese prefer to Finland from the Nordic countries - tourists are attracted by a rainbow: in autumn it is possible to see a fabulous mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start rainbow trips in early autumn, Visit Finland says in a statement.
The main tourist destinations in Japan are Inari and Levi.
Revontulet are the main cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with heart-winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a good demand for winter skiing in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase sales for autumn trips.
Few people know that the season begins early in the autumn and continues until the long spring.
In autumn it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the rainbow lights, making the sight twice as fabulous, says Anne Lind, Head of Marketing at Visit Finland.
Visit Finland’s main target group are wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35, living in the city, who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland through online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive landscape among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would want clearer and unique sights from Finland, and there is a tremendous potential, according to Lind.
The number of Japanese tourists staying overnight in Finland has increased significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent overnight in Finland more than twice as much as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
Japanese tourists are an interesting target group in terms of Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
The average Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain is content with rugby silver as FID championship course leads to gold
Britain’s impressive advance in the rugby tournament crashed into the final challenge featured by Fiji in Thursday night’s final, when the team suffered a 43-7 breakdown at Deodoros Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi held a masterclass in handling, beating, passing, supporting, running lines, and silk in force while winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
The defeat was accompanied by a reasonable consolation for the silver medal - the third of Britain's Day - and they could be proud of their hard work at the opening tournament of Olympic rugby, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A tough 7-5 win from South Africa in the semi-finals played earlier on the same day may have bothered them in the final.
Despite this, Fidi would have won even a top 15 team.
Britain may – but probably not – be comforted by the fact that at least one British has a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: FID’s head coach is Ben Ryan, the former English boss from Wimbledon.
The trip to Britain has been very long.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
They lost only one.
This backbone hurts, but the development is staggering.
Fidi started out outright rejecting Britain’s tackles for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his teams, it was as if they were rushing toward moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau plunged into the finish area in the corner.
When it was four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right side led to a goal stroke.
12-0, and Britain had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell’s brilliant tackling stopped man-mountain Leone Nakara from scoring a third goal, but it was just a slowdown for Fidel.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, and Britain was 17-0 defeated.
Nakarawa scored again for a new start, and there was still more than a minute left of the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou sank through the loose streets of Britain and rushed to the line to paint.
At the end of the break, the score was 29-0.
It looked just like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Britain was just learning the game.
And this is actually the case.
Britain made a number of changes in the break that blocked Fidel Castro’s pad for a total of four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored after Fidel Castro’s impressive feeding game.
Dan Norton scored a goal for Britain while making a touchdown in the left corner and narrowing the situation to the numbers 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the Antarctic islanders whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the audiences.
It was hard not to admire Fidi’s cheerful approach.
Mata Viliame’s last-minute paint had a splash in Fidi’s cake, which didn’t need splashing.
The pile was flogged, the Fidians embraced, and Britain fell to the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier on the same day, Fidi had defeated Japan in the semi-finals by 20-5, and Britain defeated South Africa in the strict semi-finals, where both scored a single goal - Britain's goal shot decided the game.
Kyle Brown led South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal range with blinding footwork and scored under the goal columns in the second half.
A brilliant late record from Marcus Watson, the brother of the English 15-aside rugby team Anthony, secured the victory and eventually a silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer brings Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to triumph
There will be no more emotional gold in these races, and that really means something.
From the first to the last, 220 tough rushes toward the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
The echo of Coach Robin Williams was present all the time as the duo hit their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's pair competition - the first women in British sports history to such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th unbeaten appearance, which is also a record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes joining on the surface with the sealing of a hammer, does not fully depict the nature of victory.
There is a group of helpful pairs of hands behind each match that gradually promote the things that matter. and no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who 30 months ago, after being diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was overwhelming.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they performed surgery.
If they do not cut, it will spread everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It changes your way of thinking a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to be able to start his treatments in early 2014 outside the season, causing as little disturbance as possible – if the term could ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get a salary, so I had to recover quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the department - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time, when they said a few steps would be enough.
So it began.
Calling in itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first thing in the couple’s mind was Williams, who had had a nervous morning and had spoken a little more than usual trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Afghan Command of the Royal Artillery Regiment, said: “I’ve had a sentimental shock this week, which may be a little overreacting, but this means so much to me.”
It just highlights how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin too, have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been fantastic.
Without him, we’t be anything, so thank him very much, he’s the best coach in the world.
I could not have imagined a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost in five years.
The pair set a tough rhythm that their competitors could not reach.
Even on the last 500 meters, as teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very stuck in a moment.
Helen cried out, “stay in the process, stay in the process.”
It is very important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything special.
We were not looking for fireworks today, we were just looking for a good match and winning the race, and we did.
The couple will have to wait a year before they decide on their future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
He just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this would be my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better,” he said.
Iceland to replace government in Panama
Iceland is scheduled to hold early parliamentary elections in October, which are being demanded by protesters in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians used tax havens to evade taxes.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Elections are held on October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the rage of the people last year will affect the outcome of autumn elections.
In the June presidential elections, criticism of the rulers was clearly visible, and Gudni Johannesson, a candidate from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has canceled his latest speech.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that President Barack Obama, the founder of the Islamic State group and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, was involved in creating the organization.
The Democratic Party was angry at the speech and asked for an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to be commander-in-chief of the army who can sink down there," Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of Muslim-favoured covered burkini swimsuits on beaches, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
In a decree signed by Mayor David Lisnard, it is forbidden to go to the beaches and swim for anyone who does not wear a bathing suit that respects good habits and secularism.
The decision also states that swimsuits that greatly express religious connections may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
In late July, two men linked to the Islamic State group attacked a church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region crossed the seashore - in Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from the official beaches of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only on the swimming pool of Pyykösjärvi has been observed blue-leaf fatigue.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Environmental Measures of the Oulu Region took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
The concentrations of E. coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in the bathing waters of all beaches, with the exception of the seaside beach, were below the measure limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococcus were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the measure limit.
The blue-leaf decay observed on Pyykösjärvi’s beach does not make the water unable to swim yet, but in favorable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-leaf bloom, in which case blue-green leaf mass is formed on the water surface as rails.
The Environmental Action is monitoring the situation with intensified checks.
If the blue-leaf flower turns into a blue-leaf flower, this will also be separately on the bathing beach notice board.
Check out the bathing water tests here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen on forest gift reduction: More than 80 percent of forest owners are outside
The forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the Finance Ministry’s next year’s budget proposal.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generation shift of forestry.
In the proposal of the Ministry of Finance, the reduction of forest gifts has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of the forest and to increase the supply of wood.
The purpose of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the net capital income of forestry.
Overall, the idea of creating such a tool to promote the generation shift in forestry farms is good, says Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Director of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, there is some criticism about the tax change.
The deduction of forest gifts is proposed to be made from the net capital income of the forest owner.
It is the capital income, from which all other deductions have been deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the effect of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of the wood.
With the deduction of net capital income from forestry, it is prevented that on the basis of the deduction there will be a loss of capital income from forestry, which would be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would get a tax benefit even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to describe it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model affects only a small percentage of forest owners.
The limit of the tax deduction bound to the forest’s return value is 40,000 euros.
It seems to be drawn too high.
As such, it will cut 82 percent of Finnish forest owners out of the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 percent of forest owners, he says.
In the VM, it is considered that the boundary guarantees the goal of growing the size of the farm.
In forest policy, the reduction of forest gifts has been cutting down for decades.
This is due to the ageing of forestry.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are retired.
A powerful rainbow surprised drivers at Himanga - two cars crashed into a pit and collided
There was a strange catastrophe in the sea on Friday morning.
According to the rescue agency, two consecutive cars crashed into the pit, after which the backman crashed into the front driver.
According to firefighter Harri Pyyhtya, the fall into the pit is suspected to have been due to a strong rainbow.
There were two people in the car, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There is no detailed information about their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometers towards Kalajoe.
A Finnish study can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
The recent findings of researchers at the University of Turku can help develop more effective cancer treatments.
The findings of Academy professor Johanna Ivaska’s research team show that the hardness of a cancer tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to correspond to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of drug therapies against cancer may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue, as well as on cancer cells.
The results of the study were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications.
The murder of Mohos' family home continues in court, the prosecutor demands a murder sentence for another perpetrator
The trial continues in the court for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family homicide in Muhos.
He was sentenced to eight years and four months for murder and robbery.
The second is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person and gross robbery.
The convict was also convicted of serious risk to road safety as a young person and of driving a vehicle as a young person.
The judgment of the district court was appealed by the prosecutor, the deputies and the man who received a tougher sentence.
The prosecutor demands that the man who received a milder sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder committed as a young person.
At the time they were fully understood.
According to the district court, 17-year-old youths murdered a man who worked as a director of the children’s protection unit at a schoolhouse in July last year.
The 17-year-old, who was convicted of murder, allegedly attacked the driver sitting on the couch in the living room from behind.
The director had escaped and led the young man into his room, when one of the young men struck him with a vacuum cleaner.
The director was also beaten, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the investigation, both convicts were fully aware at the time of the crime.
According to the court, the young men had planned to escape from the family home at least from the day before.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate in the world, reproducing only at the age of 156
The world's longest living vertebrate has been confirmed by an ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern part of the Atlantic, such as around Greenland, the ice shark, or holker, can live up to 400 years.
The female does not grow until the age of 156.
The longevity of a glacier is increased by the fact that it grows only one centimetre per year.
Only one species of mushrooms is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Scientists determined age by radio-carbon testing.
As a result of nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks contained radioactive residues.
The researchers were able to estimate the age of the shark.
The oldest one was estimated to be 392 years old, but it could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world.
Up to one-third of the state’s total tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump’s corporate tax change was implemented.
Tax revenue would also decrease with tax relief, especially for the wealthiest.
Trump described his tax plan as revolutionary when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
The corporate tax would be reduced from 35% to 15%.
Without it, there would be an enormous sum, $1 trillion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump’s proposed reduction of 33.

History of the Past - People's News
The sea turns deadly, but the actual wave hits in the middle of Madrid's streets - the accounting with the past can begin.
This is the story of Pedro Almodóvar.
Almodovar’s previous film, Traveler’s Lovers (2013), was a small-scale and rude satirical comedy, preceding the culmination of his career in Spanish touring in The Skin Where I Live (2011).
In fact, Julieta (2016) is situated somewhere between these two works.
It is a quiet, peaceful love, relationship and family drama with a mother-daughter relationship at the heart.
The story is simple and we see it as a long backdrop.
Life seems to be the model for a middle-aged man (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be surprised until the end of the movie.
In the form of a backward and long letter, Julieta tells the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He starts from the time before his daughter’s birth, from the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, the second female protagonist is Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, a TV acquaintance from the series The Time Between the Seams (2013-2014).
Julieta’s aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a cuddle, but I would say, quite literally and with a twist.
Almodóvar films often have such a characteristic sense of humor as Juliet has a fair distance.
It is an equally acting, restrained, place by place containing good music and a rather sad movie, which as such has ingredients for elegance.
Instead, the visual color saturation that is typical for the Spanish director is preserved and so that it begins to squeeze in the eye a little bit quietly, more as a pure form than as a working dramatic effect.
The characters in the film suffer from illnesses, deaths or otherwise just sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is especially true of costume: in the case of the name person, the costumes change from scene to scene, and the same is true of the appealing ears.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, that is, the attitudes of the scene in question, are not improved.
Mechanically repeated, the impression is outward and slightly breathless.
Almodóvar has written the script based on three novels by Canadian novelist Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013.
The novels have been published in The Wreck: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly flat-cut literary filmatisation.
The ingredients would have been emotionally incomparably thriving even in a more dramatic drama, with so many big things - especially the flattering guilt - the theme of the film deals with.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
Starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao and Dario Grandinetti.
The movie premieres at 12.8.
The government is trying to vote - People's News
No new cuts will be made, the ministers say, so that the basic Finns do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be carried out in robberies.
There will be no new cuts.
The billions already saved are enough.
This is stated by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (collective) during the budget debate.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM’s proposal, as cuts to social security were already decided in the spring framework debate.
Children’s allowance, people’s pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the people’s pension index will be cut by 0.85 percent.
The length of unemployment coverage will be reduced from 500 to 400 days.
The education cuts continue.
The Ghosts
Why do ministers emphasize that there are no new cuts?
Next year is an election year.
The municipal elections are held in April and they are the main heat meter of the parliamentary period, not gallups.
It has been seen before that the results of municipal elections that lead the government parties in different directions will ruin the mood of the government for a long time.
Gallup reports, however, that the ruling party is expecting a major defeat, despite its modest 12.3% result in the previous elections compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns received 752 new delegates, for many of whom the price of influencing the right-wing government will be realised next spring.
The life rope of the government of three roughly equal-sized parties depends on the longevity of the Basic Finns.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the party voters got enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group’s fermentation have also come to the surface.
The rhetoric of “no new cuts will come”, first, obscures the fact that next year they will be carried out harshly and, second, attempts to soften the blow awaiting the Orthodox Finns.
Cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will likely be different – if the Sipilö government is still standing.
The Government has set the goal of reducing debt over this term, but in the Petteri Orpo budget proposal the debt will be taken next year at 5.9 billion euros, or more than this year.
After the election, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own program: debt-raising is neither slower nor slower.
The other is to stick to the program.
This means new, even harsher cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be shaken at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring we will take what is coming in parliamentary elections.
These actions do not result in debt
It is quite clear that debt-growing is not possible with current actions, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to spark a positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäe at the budget awareness session prove this inadvertently:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved overstated, meaning there will be no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish national economy has hardly risen since the collapse of 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy pursued in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% over this decade and has extended from an average of 34 weeks to 54 weeks.
Unemployment costs three billion euros a year more than in 2008.
According to the curve presented by Hetemäe, the debt of public communities, which exceeded the 60 percent threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 percent by the middle of the next decade.
What is Responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the Left Union’s debt relief proposal was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the cost ofining unemployment will be approximately 6 billion euros, which will be covered entirely by taking new debt.
This is the perception of the centre, the collective and the primitive Finns of what is responsible.
A lot of tasks are left to the municipalities.
Three out of four consider that the organization of daycare, youth work and physical activity for children belongs to the responsibility of the municipality, according to the KAKS - Foundation for the development of the municipality.
A clear majority of the people roll the responsibility to the individual municipality also for libraries, culture, citizens’ institutes, construction supervision, high school education and waste management.
The responsibility of the countryside, in turn, is most clearly sought for landscape planning, specialized medical care, vocational education, vocational sciences schools and institutional care for people with developmental disabilities.
None of the municipal responsibilities are transferred to the state.
Drunk driver runs after police run away
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuula escaped a police guard in Joensuula on Ilomantsinti on Friday night at half one.
A police guard tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man ran out to drive the police away at a fairly high speed.
The pursuit continued to Sonkajanranti, from which it continued to Sorronahonti and a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove out of the road.
After that, the young man ran away, but a faster policeman ran to catch the runner.
The driver’s blow test showed 0.75 promiles.
He also did not have a driving license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated as a serious threat to road safety.
A truck in the stone collapsed.
A truck that was in stone glass crashed into a pit in Polvijärvi on the Kaavinti on Thursday night at 21.15.
The truck had driven to the left in a curved curve out of the road and crashed into a river.
The rescue agency lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above the truck, together with the rescue helicopter staff and primary care workers.
The lifting of the vehicle was the responsibility of the owner.
From the crashed truck spilled hydraulic oil into the road which the rescue facility absorbed into turf.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An old woman disappeared in the afternoon.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahdenkylä in the South Pohjanmaa.
Police are looking for a woman about 165 centimeters long, thin, with white hair stretching underneath her jaw.
For observations and clues about the missing person's movements, please call the emergency center of the Pohjanmaa on the suggestion number 0295440513.
The elements of the major accident in the air - see the photo gallery of the disasters of Parafest
The collapse of the Parafest festival tents caused enormous damage.
Arto Pippuri, chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be financially fit, and the event can also be organized next year.
Parafest’s last performer Kalle Salonen appeared at the end of Friday night on the square.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances in the premises of the city theater from 13 a.m.
At the Art Center of Ahjo, the Parafest exhibition will be held at 13-15.
The program is planned.
The collapse flow occurs in a thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a decreasing air flow.
Changes in the condition of the water in the cloud bind heat, and thus the falling air cools and accelerates its pace towards the ground.
According to the Department of Meteorology, there are several floods in Finland during the summer.
The path of the collapse is difficult to predict.
The collapse struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the site of Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents collapsed and there were about 200 people in the tents.
Four people injured themselves slightly.
Among them was one child who was transported to further care in a slightly injured condition.
Air pollution increases London population
Research has shown that the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The cause of ageing is air pollution.
The study was by Evening Standard.
British skin care company Caci analyzes the most toxic particles in London’s air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many Londoners in retirement age are two and a half years older than their peers in rural areas.
Small particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollutants that come from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that premature aging is a risk especially for those Londoners who walk their work trips near crowded streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with various masks, but as a more practical solution, regular skin cleaning is recommended.
Tractor brakes tricked a man in front of him
He had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and walked in front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor spilled over the man.
The man did not fall below it, but the tractor took the man to the point that he was transported to the central hospital for further examination with serious injuries.
The tractor could not move further because it collided with the stones in front of it.
Strengthening for the upcoming season
Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Airball Championship League, will start the series starting in October from better starting points than men’s memory.
The team has been together for three weeks.
The common tone is sure to be found better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Rienno’s head coach, praises the new team for being entrepreneurial and unified.
Foreign trophy midfielder Fred Musoni begins his second season in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwanda national team, is a 205 centimetre cracker.
Garchet is a passar, while the Brazilian measures 198 centimeters.
Through Josba, Katajan and River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every world championship since 2003.
Now in Tampere are going for the sixth time, only 2013 missed Canada was better in the North American quarters.
I was working in the market and playing with the local women’s club when I noticed the announcement.
The United States was setting up the Salibandy National Team.
I was interested and here we are now, says Jumppanen, 48.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near Elizabeth, New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen entered Joensuu University to study computer science.
When I came to Rio, such a species was not yet played at the SM level as salibandy.
It was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataya and later in Jokipoj in ice hockey in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played with the university team in the SM series of the saliband in the 1991-92 season, the next three periods were held in Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the club A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM series culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM Series 10 times, with a balance of 169 matches of 51 + 34 = 85.
The last season is 2001-2002.
Tatu Väänänen and Perttu Puska were named in the national team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech EFT tournament in Brno from 6 to 8 November.
Perttu Puska, a 25-year-old attacker in Helsinki, has played this before six men's land matches, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13.
Swiss Wiler-Ersigen’s 32-year-old defender Tatu Väänänen has recovered from a hip disorder and is part of the national team’s standard fleet with 117 land games experience.
In the national team was also named Seinäjoen Pelivratilor's concarrer Mika Kohonen, who was seen in the Finnish shirt for the last time at the World Cup last December.
The head coach of the team is Petri Kettunen.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold is missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish Beach Volleyball Championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvala Sports Park.
During the three days, medals will be played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with Kouvolan Airballers and the Finnish Airball Association, the SM final tournament will qualify for the six best pairs in the ranking of each series.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY’s grown Essi Hasu, who has been in the top of Finnish beach volley for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be able to attend this weekend.
It is going to be a great stadium.
I haven’t played very often in the adult series in Kouvolan, so it’s great to play in the finals at home.
The Kouvolan region lit Hasu’s spark to the sport and gave good meals to a great hobby.
There are great memories of childhood.
I started flying ball at the age of 9 with Elimäen NMKY’s E-girls.
The main thing in mind is a too big t-shirt, knee protectors rotating in the ankle, as well as stunning ass screams and choreographies after a point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a tight community where everyone knew each other.
The spirit of the group created an environment in which it was pleasant to play.
All the families were strongly involved in the action – the team-mate’s father trained us and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle’s beach volleyball was already a natural choice as a counterweight to indoor volleyball.
The swimming pool has been played since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went on to watch the junior SM-tour with the thought that someday I would be there to play.
Now this dream becomes a reality when Hasu will play together with Anniina Parkkinen in the SM finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
The SM gold is still missing from the prize wardrobe, Hasu throws mysteriously.
This weekend’s appearance in Kouvolan may be the last for Hasulle in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await us.
The international career is over after the tournament.
Otherwise, the toe shoes will be put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
A collapse flowed into tents in a disabled incident in the River, a major accident was near

There was a show in a bigger tent.
Two of the rooms were smaller.
The incident occurred on Friday at 17.
Firefighter Markus Viitaniemi, a journalist interviewed by Karjalainen, told the newspaper that there were elements involved in the major accident.
According to the newspaper, the event is in danger.

Solomon Koli became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and agility.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in the countryside.
Two years ago, Koli, together with his younger brother, Valtteri Koli, started working as a continuation of their home.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant borrowing and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my story since I was a kid.
I’ve always liked working on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything in the game.
If you want to do something, you need to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a housing facility, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
I myself, however, took a really courageous part in the project and I have been fully involved in it, says Salomon Koli and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything will turn to good.
Salomon Koli, who grows meat cars, aims to invest in an even larger farm.
The work has yielded results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the Young Food Producer Competition of Rural Future.
He is currently competing for a victory.
He can be voted on the newspaper’s website until 21.8.
Bulgaria reports inflation for first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest number in years (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2 % was.
The average annual inflation, measured by the cost of living index, was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost of living index for July 2016 was 101,0% compared to June 2016, or the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) the inflation rate has been -0,2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0,2%, compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 the prices of the following consumer goods increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7 %), transport (1,8 %), leisure and culture (6,3 %), restaurants and hotels (1,2 %), mixed goods and services (0,3 %).
Prices dropped in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine care (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as last month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat’s “anime” effect criticized as Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, the anime has served as a source of inspiration for the filter, but according to some observers it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million of its daily users to modify reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can transform yourself into an ananas, a dog, or a figure that would fit Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
Lenses are simple, facial twisting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All illusions quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat’s lenses have previously been criticized with accusations that the app advertises a blackface mask or favors whitened skin as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat advertised this week to some users a lens that gave them folded eyes, folded teeth and folded cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asian people – “yellow faces.”
And they wondered if these recurring controversies could be a sign of the company’s greater problem with diversity.
News and outrage spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had shut down the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was intended as a tribute to animated characters, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But for racist-experienced observers, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others denied the anime comparison fiercely.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about photos were widely shared, said in an email that the lens was “at least offensive and uncomfortable.”
He added that “it’s difficult to argue against a comparison of a rough Asian cartoon and filter effects.”
It shows that the filter is not only yellowed, but yellowed, carried to extreme degradation.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural pitfalls.
American culture seems to be stuck in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge, racially more diverse audience of teenagers may mean they’re even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
In an interview Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an insulting image, “these guys find it much harder than ever to be unnoticed.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believes race-related disputes reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s remuneration practices.
Zhu criticized the company’s mainly white male leadership and ended his post with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#DeleteSnapchat)
“Either they don’t have a diverse representation of different skin colours in their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions like this,” said the Chinese-American Zhu, “or they have representatives of different skin colours at work, but they are not in positions where they would feel safe or could speak outright.”
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company hired a recruiter some time ago to focus on underrepresented populations and advance internal inclusion efforts.
Zhu added, “I think they actually need more users like us to say this isn’t okay.”
Congressional panel says military officials misrepresented ISIS intelligence
In a report released on Thursday, a congressional panel said officials modified intelligence reports from the U.S. military headquarters to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what events on the ground justified.
A mid-year report from the Working Group set up by the Republican Chairman of the House Defence Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defence Budget Subcommittee found a “widespread discontent” among headquarters intelligence analysts, who said their chiefs ticked their estimates of American efforts to defeat ISIS.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is a staff of the Armed Forces Military Zone in Tampere, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Intelligence outputs approved by senior Centcom executives typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than what the facts on the ground justified.
“Centcom’s events are unacceptable – our war fighters suffer when poor analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers,” said Ken Calvert, a spokesman for California Republican.
Centcom’s management failures reach the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems in headquarters descriptions and analysis of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that senior administration officials in the Obama administration had ordered the reports to be spoofed, it depicts analysts feeling as if the Centcom leaders had put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
“During the entire first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonials from the headquarters to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves,” the report said.
Centcom officials, for example, have publicly stated that a major assault to recapture Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, is still under the control of Islamic State.
“After months of investigation, this is very clear,” Kansas Republican spokesman Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, senior intelligence officers at the U.S. Armed Forces Military District headquarters manipulated the headquarters intelligence outputs to mitigate the ISIS threat in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a working group after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence information about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, follows the broader findings as the investigation is ongoing.
The Defense Ministry’s chief inspector has launched an additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom’s intelligence.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the Republican Working Group’s final findings.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an unnecessarily isolated process for the intelligence assessment of ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” Adam B. Schiff, the senior Democrat, said in a statement.
Schiff said this process “prolonged the release of intelligence outputs”, worsened the mood among analysts and “did not give enough space to divergent perspectives.”
Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House had attempted to pressure Centcom analysts to align their conclusions with “a predetermined or political narrative.”
The Daily Beast will report on Tuesday on the preliminary results of the congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times that the Pentagon’s chief inspector had begun an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander-in-Chief Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Ministry would not comment on the congressional report as long as the inspector’s investigation is ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Defense Ministry welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential national security issues.”
The investigation has other consequences than just the question of whether U.S.-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as an increasing number of defence officials are now claiming).
Last year’s accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on the headquarters to deliver honest estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
The criticism of Islamic State intelligence reflects controversy over a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article stating that despite the objections of several analysts, President George W. Bush’s administration supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about what the consequences of a 2003 attack would be.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion over Islamic State intelligence.
According to authorities last year, Hooker’s group concluded that despite the opposite public statements, airstrikes against refineries controlled by the Islamic State had not significantly undermined the terrorist group’s economy, as it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through a black exchange.
The Times in September that the discovery, however, was not outside the headquarters.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many lawmakers considered his testimony to the Senate to be an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
For the fourth time in a row, the U.S. wins the women's land hockey to host an interim match with Britain
A day after scoring three goals by winning Japan’s 6-1 team, Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the U.S. women’s land hockey team on Thursday when the Americans defeated India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn’t sure he had done the same before.
“I have no idea,” he said.
“I’m not the kind of person who keeps a book of paintings.”
But this is what he knows: The Americans are in a 4-0 situation in the Olympic tournament and they share their group’s first place with Britain, which was still unbeaten after defeating Japan 2-0.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have survived the quarter-half, and this game will decide who will be placed first and who will be second in their six-team group.
The first place avoids a strong Dutch, the second group leader, for a little longer at the start of the quarterfinals.
No matter how Saturday’s game ends, Americans have stirred up with their surprising success here, four years after leaving the last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was in that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and picked up the land hockey field for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played the genre at Drexel) joining the national team at the age of 16, making him the youngest player ever.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he did not enter the final list of players.
In 2012, nothing happened to him and his teammates.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” said Bam.
We did not have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We have made a complete translation.
On Thursday evening, Bam started the first half with a crossbow close to the goal.
India had come into play in the air with no win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation in the 1-0 readings until the end of the third half, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then turned around the center and kicked the ball to the goal, leading the Americans to the 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth half.
This zero game was the first tournament to be played by U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the first three wins.
He is in good shape.
So is Bam.
“We’re in a good situation now,” Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
Trampoline Peace in the Middle of the Olympic Games
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is, the Olympics are ongoing.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a continuous and inevitable, furious message of competition and effort.
It’s as if the Olympic breath itself was a flaming message bubble, passed from a bowfighter to a swimmer and from a gymnast to a triathlete.
It is impossible to turn on a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to a friend’s conversation in the line of a cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledeck, or the hatred between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time and future heartbreaker of the Olympics with a smile, could well be one of those well-known names to be presented for the best time to watch and supported by sponsorship agreements as well as good-minded TV ads – if she were a swimmer, gymnast, or even a swordman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
Olympic hockey does not illuminate all species equally.
Further away from the center, partially in the shadow, are those species that are not generally accepted by everyone: air pistol shooting, arch shooting, sulphur, taekwondo.
We always have a chest, as long as it lives.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special favourites, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its debut at the Sydney Games, there has been so little observation of its presence in the past 16 years that many of those I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal there, and its athlete has not advanced to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russian generally share men’s, Chinese and Canadian women’s medals.
This year, Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLennan will defend their London gold medals.
However, the trampoline is associated with a certain kind of bassist charm, in part because it sounds more suitable for a clown school than for the Olympics to an uncivilized ear.
Here I have to admit that I am not an expert, I am just a fan of flight failure.
The genre has opportunities for fun, as can be seen in the vibration of the endless bumps of cartoons, but it also has the fusion of gymnastics and swimming bumps, two species that in principle combine.
The word “trampoline” comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a jumping board.
Championship aspirants will jump on a giant trampoline up to almost 30 feet high, and they will have to perform swinging moves (turns, folds, and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official program of the Olympics, they are judged on the basis of implementation, difficulty and “flight time.”
There are 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight forward.
Those who hope for a medal must go further, faster, up and beyond – sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth around the field.
Not only do they hunt the goal line or the starting wall, but also, in television news, another fading boundary: a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical — and it can even get the viewer to tears.
But that’s also why watching the games can be a bit exhausting.
The trampoline provides a rest time from this.
The trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new ascent, appearing weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly again up.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty in this, but during the program there is no furious rush toward the end, no jump to the distance, only a sleepy, digestive interruption of time and gravity.
It’s as close to Zen as what the Olympics can get.
The women’s sweepstakes competition and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon with the broadcast starting at 13 (ET), the men’s competitions will also be held on Saturday at 13 (ET).
NBC will broadcast the final as part of its afternoon program starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic shock, they offer a quiet, charming moment that is most likely not noticed in the general chaos.
And if awareness is only achieved by offering male athletes to be watched and objected (as male gymnasts in the U.S. suggested some time ago, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his shocking new fan base.
“Generation shows its mind” in Ethiopia, the long-standing ally of the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been killed in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia collapsing?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights groups said the government’s response was ruthless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Widespread videos recorded during protests, believed to be from late last year or early this year, show how security authorities beat young people with sticks while they were forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations Human Rights Council is calling for a thorough investigation.
“Keeping this country together has always been difficult, and in the future it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, who is project manager for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with Ethiopians in the fight against the threat of terrorism in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much aid from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved tremendously, and the capital, Addis Ababa, even has a new business train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model for democracy, human rights organizations have continuously talked about government repression, the country’s opposition has been limited, and dissenters have been effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this may be changing.
“If you repress people and they have no choice but to show their mind, that will happen,” said Seyoum Teshome, a university professor from Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth showed up.
One generation is showing up.
The complaints are diverse and cover everything from land use to the crushing of the ruling coalition’s power.
After last year’s heavily criticized elections, the ruling party, its ally, won the last seat held by the opposition, and now holds all seats in parliament.
Meanwhile, tensions on the border with Eritrea are growing.The battle along this tense and controversial border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to take advantage of the riot and re-armed themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of floating under the surface, bitter emotions are now exploding.
The first one seems seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Only in the last few years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become widespread and internet service has improved.
Even if the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during protests, many people can still communicate their location through hidden web proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this is how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oroms and the Amhars, get better together.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amhars, who come from Ethiopia’s predominantly Christian highlands, succeeded in politics and business by exploiting the Oroms, many of whom are Muslims and who live in the lowlands.
But this is also changing.
“We are on our way to organizing under one umbrella,” said Mulatu Gemechu, head of the municipality.
The biggest protests have been in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many amharas and oroms think that those who rule Ethiopia unfairly belong to the tiger people. The nation covers about six percent of the population and dominates the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who looked around the corners.
Analysts say he was skilled at detecting early signs of dissatisfaction and using secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
“The current government has no such basic instinct,” said conflict analyst Abdi.
Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up as a relatively unknown to fill Meles’ boots.
Unlike Meles, who was native to the tiger region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the security services controlled by tigers don’t trust him.
Many fear that this can lead to increased bleeding.
The last time Ethiopia was in such a turmoil was in 2005, when thousands demonstrated over elections that, according to analysts, seemed to have been first hutiliated and then robbed by the government.
In the subsequent raids, many demonstrators were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure design, such as a new work trip train, and for substantial progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the country’s internal intensification of the Ethiopian government’s contempt.
And now it is beginning to take a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, demonstrators in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked companies owned by tigers, and anti-tiger hatred is becoming increasingly widespread on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the U.S. and other Western allies in a mess.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for flights to neighbouring Somalia, even though it has said it has closed the base some time ago.
While Western countries are clearly willing to support democracy, they do not want their allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
“This,” Abdi said, “is a real balance.”
Donald Trump calls Obama-founded ISIS allegations “sarcastic”
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress the controversy over his most recent campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he repeatedly insisted this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The survey raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have stumbled to defend him during a stormy period, in a difficult position where they have to explain remarks he may not necessarily mean.
Following the hint at Wednesday night’s campaign meeting, Trump argued the same more and more enthusiastically in Thursday’s interviews, in which he intended that his intention really was to say that the president and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in an early Friday morning tweet, Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The release was a full swing from the day before, when Trump said in several interviews that he was really serious about the accusation.
When Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump spread his comment by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, a Republican presidential candidate took this to his ears.
The latest storm of criticism comes as Trump has tried to re-focus his campaign on the economy amid falling polls.
Trump and Clinton fought while talking about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried again to address the issue.
Escaping again to Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he considered the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcastic defense.
In late July, after facing widespread criticism apparently suggesting that Russians should hack Clinton’s emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, “Of course I’m sarcastic.”
The approach allows Trump to go across the boundaries of political speech and then return if necessary.
“I think it’s a model where he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then ‘explains’ in one direction or another depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has monitored both candidates’ language usage.
But I also think he’s crazy about his statements and knows they’re vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Rather than lessening his speeches for a large voting audience, Trump has been even more sluggish in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll published on Friday showed that Trump lags behind Clinton significantly in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things he says, he often blames his critics for misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces an increasingly closer look during the last few months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they have to publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, worked hard to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I believe there are real, political comments in his words,” Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that’s why it happened because he pulled his troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Clinton worked as a foreign secretary, allowed ISIS to worsen because it failed to effectively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday's Pennsylvania meetings, Trump continued on Twitter to attack news media that grind his every word and are biased against him.
He mocked the “bad, pitiful” television experts who try to make him clear by saying, “They don’t succeed!”
Some Democrats mocked Trump’s excuse as new evidence that he is inappropriate to be president.
Previously closed café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a sluggish, only cash-acceptable place in Williamsburg, with no wireless network, but offering good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the bedford avenue was too expensive for him.
The business, which replaced Verbi in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cup cake-shaped soaps.
The locals mourned it as the last loss in a city that was being restored to the middle class.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: “New York is changing, I know, but I still can’t believe that the CBGB is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is demolished and the Verb is now a soap store.”
But if New York is changing, it is also reinventing.
The revived Verb opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff is still the same and there is the same refined atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verbe is headed by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and CEO of the new location.
He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When a client offered to fund him in a new location, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things unchanged.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought the same type of espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
In the menu you can find baked chicken egg cheese sandwiches, and in the coatings you can find, for example, caprice and browned onions.
There is brown rice.
No more beer is served in the cafe, but fresh juices are made there.
Over the course of nine months, Rodriguez says he has noticed a steady stream of old loyal customers.
“Williamsburg became too expensive for many former customers as well,” he said.
One last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira had one such customer.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he walked into the cafe.
He says that when Verbin closed, he quit drinking coffee for a moment.
“I realized that I Verbi’s coffee and culture,” he said.
Now she’s back for coffee, although that day she ordered a mixed chai drink instead of her usual ice coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-time client, Tom Rosenthal, has been faithful to Verb since 2003.
He went there before working and always made the same order.
“Every day at fifteen over seven, regularly like the clock, I went in and they were preparing my spicy bagel with butter,” she said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes, due to variation, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he is not resentful of the soap store that took over the old farms.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb, which would be used as an ingredient for coffee refrigerated in the cafe.
“I think we can still grasp the offer,” Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the cafe.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to put it out somewhere soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
A local juicer wants to bottle and sell cold coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will expand into the adjacent building.
For many customers, it’s enough to get their old favorites in the new verb.
Joseph Whitt was a loyal customer and said he was unsettled when the venue was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said she felt like she had come home walking inside and ordering a coffee.
“I wanted to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: The Paralyzing Food
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office.
A delight, President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue foods, such as the gooseberry paste, and the Maryland mouth turtle juice.
That day his diet was more modest: filled eggs in a tomato sauce, potato sauce and dessert from a peach.
“It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity with people who suffer,” Jane Ziegelman said.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe’s latest book, Chop Suey, talked about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman talked about life from the Lower East Siden mansion through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, which Harper releases on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Demonstrating some of their own culinary solidarity, they meet a reporter at dinner at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop, a small, unrefined lunch bar in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the 1929 stock market collapse.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese-olive bread, and Coe, 57, took a portion of turkey, potato sauce, and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meat bowl, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating a meal.
“The drinks were very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There was a peanut straw, a pay straw, a popcorn straw.
They were made from a manufacturing ingredient and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual manufacturing ingredient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make up your dinner.
Coe is Irvine.
“It must have felt like a heavy lead in the stomach,” he said.
In the years before the recession, the American tables, especially in the countryside, were like a eat-so-many-like-seats table.
Women’s groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronicles the ways a nation survived when suddenly it was no longer a land of abundance.
“At that time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally troubling was the new, inexpensive diet: Mysterious dishes such as sorrows and boxes became the main dishes, and the box was “a great way to use food sources,” Ziegelman noted, as chefs were able to hide less appealing ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been at the heart of American dishes for years, became a luxury product that was sparingly served.
Special formulations were tried where calorie and nutrient content were more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While conducting research also for a book of recipes, Ziegelman prepared an era dish in which fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition to the dinner table,” Coe said.
Ziegelman said: “It was unrealistic.”
Peanut butter is not suitable for roasted onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts such as Louise Stanley, the head of the federal household agency from 1923 to 1943, directed the country’s eating habits more than ever before or after.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to start as “budgeters” and meet the challenge of turning spaghetti and carrots-like snacks into tasty servings.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic flavors.
Particularly tasty are reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s “Let Me Eat the Cake” attitude.
Meanwhile, publicly praising her childhood’s simple, Iowa country food, she ate like the sophisticated millionaire she had become.
“He liked continental food, like fish on a garlic sauce,” Coe said.
He ate in a near-golded dining room wearing a smoking.
He was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example with his own stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that “was not only serving the worst food in Washington, but also the worst cooked.”
Many of the Lamanic eating practices were abandoned as soon as the earth was back on its feet.
The legacy is our ongoing focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as how she couldn’t throw away food.
“He was really afraid of wasting food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, “He even made people sick.”
There was a windfall.
After the dishes were empty at Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the peanut butterfly that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called peanut foam,” Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a look-like name.
The dessert had no cream foam, only feathers, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone drowned their spoon unwillingly into a sticky, brown lister.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coe swallowed once and again.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, “A slightly crushed nuts could help.”
Gilead to be reimbursed for lawyer costs in hepatitis C patent battle against Merck
A U.S. jury has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc. to be entitled to reimburse the costs incurred by it in a litigation involving a patient with hepatitis C against drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from paying $200 million after breaking two Merck patents linked to Gilead’s successful drugs Sovaldi and Harvon. This release followed when a U.S. judge found Merck’s misconduct, which included a false oath and other unethical practices.
In a judgment filed on Thursday, U.S. jury judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to be released from the compensation it was incurred in the appeal.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can clearly cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of a laboratory based on the active substance of Gilead’s medicines, sofosbuvir.
U.S.-backed troops say they have taken full control of Islamic State-controlled Manbij
U.S.-backed troops have seized the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 prisoners held prisoner by fighters from the Sharfan Darwish SDF’s allies, the Manbij military council, Reuters said.
“The city is now completely under our control, but we have started investigating it,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2 percent of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and his wife's income in that year was $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton donated $1 million to charities, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned $5.3 million in speaker compensation, and the former Foreign Secretary announced that he received $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for his book telling about his career at the State Department.
Clinton’s vice president candidate, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, released their 10-year tax returns.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set a benchmark for financial transparency,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
As a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and revokes his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if they are not required by law.
New York-based businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration’s audit as a reason for refusing to disclose tax returns.
“Your turn,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when posting a link to the Democratic candidate’s tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump’s special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were completed.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charities, his business, and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton grabbed the problem by posting a video on Friday highlighting prominent Republicans urging Trump to disclose his taxes.
On Thursday, he addressed the issue in a speech in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in the last decades has done: publish his tax returns,” he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has paid no or very little taxes for two in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist borrowed numerous tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who said the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30 percent of their taxes.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At Clinton’s meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he is also undergoing a tax government audit, and that Trump is “fear” not the tax collection agency, but the voters.
Clinton’s campaign has been publishing tax returns until 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate of the Clinton residents in Chappaqua, New York, was about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5 percent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment target was a low-cost, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili pepper condoms and caterpillars enhance Tanzania's elephant protection
Conservatives in Tanzania use an unusual way to prevent elephants from migrating to human settlements – they throw animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The tool has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea several years ago, in collaboration with U.S. Nature Conservancy, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use the nonviolent four-step practice to protect homes and crops without harming animals.
In the past, many people used spikes to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since we developed the tools, we have observed a change in attitude in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep elephants away from their fields without harming them,” Honeyguide’s chief operating officer Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include pointing the penetrating elephant with a pocket lamp and playing the turf.
If it does not prevent the animal, the so-called “chili cloud” is thrown away.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and soil, as well as an electric wire, after which the condom is wrapped so that only the ignition thread remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it breaks out and splashes chili powder in the air.
One smell is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The final remedy is a trigger that fires a Roman candle in the air. The fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli direction number at Arab request
A French filmmaker, of Jewish origin, took over the media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli destination number.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust documentary, expressed his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel from the list of country destinations offered by the hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the states to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann has written.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility to call Israel through its own call center.
In search of an explanation, the filmmaker spoke at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the response “shocked him.”
The hotel’s receptionist said it was “a thoughtful decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels.”
The reason behind the decision caused even more shock in the filmmaker.
“The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the removal of the Israeli direction number,” the employee said, according to Lanzmann.
Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a “great injustice,” the Zuddeutsche Zeitung.
“We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
That is an injustice in itself.
But even more shameful is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This does not need explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident caused quite a bit of resistance online, when people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski hotel simply “gave in” to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
“Shame,” was said in another edition, noting that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all the accusations, calling the incident a “ignorance” and “apologized” to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel.
"There has never been a clear order not to include Israel on the list," Kempinski's spokesman told Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the direction number has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as students gathered to protest government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
Problems began when law enforcers tried to disperse the student crowd, leading to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their horror of the plans.
Sao Paulo Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin proposed closing just under 100 public schools and resettling 300,000 students to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti on the walls against interim President Michel Temer.
This latest demonstration took place just days after protesters marched as a group to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was arrested as the country’s Senate voted for her prosecution.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases by 71 percent
Since the lifting of the sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70,9% compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have largely shown interest in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies will continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
“Of course, one of the main objectives of Iran’s bilateral cooperation is the expansion of trade,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9% compared to the same period in 2015, totalling $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5% to a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
“Trade growth was achieved through the supply of machines, vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Embassy in Iran issued approximately 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly for travel.
For the first time, Iran was among the 20 countries with the most tourists visiting Russia.
“It’s safe to say that last year’s record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes to change.
“I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. They have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he said.
Scottish biker Callum Skinner crashed into the goal when the British picked up a bike gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner was honored in the men's team sprint at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night, when the British team's trio defended their 2012 championship from London.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was anchored in the role of his Scottish counterpart Sir Chris Roy, the legend was proud of the young man when he reached the finish, catching the victory favourite from the New Zealand team.
Britain won the shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of its six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after being modestly ranked sixth at the World Race Championship in London in March, even though Hoy has since ended his career.
The problem between the games in Beijing and London was the replacement of special messenger Jamie Staff.
This was achieved just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy’s cessation also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man from whom the British coaches held up against the potential of the Scottish, which is now realized.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the championship with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner made an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was quite behind after his own round, but Kenny pushed to lead the team, and Skinner kept it.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, and it included Hindes driving a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert on the BBC, attracting the attention of Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they entered the awards list.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: “The comparison is delightful.”
I’m here just to do my best and to gain fame.
In the final we set an Olympic record and won the world champions.
It was completely unbelievable.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning in London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had intentionally crashed on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments, and the British competitors have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem with the victory.
Hindes said, “It felt like I was in London with so many British flags on the floor.”
As a team, we have found contact over the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply fantastic.
One event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of a total of ten cycling races in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are expected to have a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny’s demonstrated fitness, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy’s masterpiece of winning three Olympic golds in one Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (that apparently holy day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister) - would raise the total number of medals to six gold and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoya.
Kenny will compete next in the sprint, which starts today and lasts three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I just this one now.
Team competition is always the best.
We win it together with our friends.
To be alone is to be lonely.”
Hindes said, “If he wins another two gold medals, he should be awarded the title of knight.”
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in the four-mile team race.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record for gold at London 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and the final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of the race, when Wiggins will definitely be at the center of attention.
He had a quarrel with the judges yesterday before time when officials called him for a length measurement.
In the competition, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald made the world record with the clock stopping at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its powerful bike team will take over the middle of the Olympics and win a whole bunch of medals.
Having demonstrated truly exceptional and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been underestimated before the Rio Games.
The backdrop has been drama, the least of which has not been technical director Shane Sutton’s resignation in April on charges of sexism and harassment, as well as the end of the race career of big figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
Based on the first-night races at the cycling stadium, however, it seems that Britain’s now legendary reputation for rising to its peak at the perfect moment could once again be true.
Portland's seamless future questionable due to cutting power contract
The future of the Portland Victoria aluminum mill, along with hundreds of jobs, is uncertain when an electricity company distributing electricity to the factory revealed that one of the factory owners is terminating a distribution contract, so it is expected to cut all distribution contracts.
The measure follows the decision of the Victoria administration earlier this year that the subsidies required to keep the plant in operation will not be continued.
The 20 year period ends in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa’s Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be endangered, directly or indirectly, as a result of a factory shutdown.
In addition, the snowball effect may be possible, as the meltdown uses about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's meltdown, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland meltdown loses money and is under the threat of closure.
The move now follows several years of speculation about the factory’s future, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the price of the factory’s production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminum welding plant from its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it is also expecting three other owners to terminate their contracts.
The majority of the factory is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL expects the operation of the Portland plant to continue, which means that the seamless physical electricity demand will continue,” it said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called “protective agreements” that should come into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a termination period of 12 months, so they will actually expire in 2017.
“That’s why AGL expects the contracts to be profitable in the financial year 2017,” the electricity company said.
All potential resulting impacts on AGL from fiscal year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong outlook for the wholesale electricity futures market.
AGL said it has already “anticipated the expiration” of the contracts reduced the value of its accounting by $187 million.
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ... ability to keep the meltdown in operation or secure a seamless power supply.”
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the deal was due to come into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the deal.
Analysts have been wary of a possible shutdown of Portland, Victoria, as well as Tomago, a factory near Newcastle, due to the poor economic situation in the industry.
Earlier this week, AGL chief operating officer Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
“If both plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
For us as an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing,” he said.
Kendall, not just the reality star of the Kardashians, is on the cover of September’s Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter of the clan, is on the cover of the U.S. Vogue's desired September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador and has been a model at Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“Looking at this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a peculiar (or maybe just the Kardashian style?), scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and with everyone’s favorite entertainer, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot about her sister’s cover, but that ended in a classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
It’s a cliché plot for almost every “birthday episode” in the children’s television series (Seacrest pronounces the proverbs “You probably didn’t think we’d forget you” with the credibility of a morning-shaped pupujuss), but Krisin had to get his other girls somehow to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we’ve definitely moved into the new era of the Kardashians with the September place on Vogue.
Kendall’s grandmother, Kim, may have hit the lawsuit on Vogue first (she shared it with her husband, Kanye West, in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite in its own category.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling edition of the year.
Its thickness resembles a coffee table protocol more than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of last year’s 832 pages had advertising content).
The revelation of its star is expected so eagerly that for the last two years, images from the newspaper have leaked before official publication.
Former women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more “celebrities who act as models” on the cover than “models who are celebrity”.
Oscar-winning and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's honorary place.
But if it happens that Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the “success model” of his generation, hits the first-mentioned category, she’s in a pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality stars or today’s youths who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all that).
They are rightly talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé’s release of Lemonade last year has been one of the strongest years in her career.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner’s success.
With her reality-TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be a bullshit.
In June, the original Victoria’s Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them “the butterflies of the moment.”
This feeling came to the surface again with Jenner’s Vogue cover.
But rotating in dissatisfaction is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He is a model for Marc Jacobs.
She sells you Estee Lauder’s makeup cream.
He and all his sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own apps behind the paywall.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford’s daughter, which she took for LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her children, she’s a real TV star.
Community legal centres evacuate 160,000 people each year
Every year, more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people are displaced from the Community’s legal centres as the sector prepares for the impact of further cuts in funding on its already completed operations at its borders.
In Queensland, three out of five people—mostly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no opportunities to fight unfair evictions, and the like—are already turned away in their search for express legal advice and representation.
The legal services already stretched to the borders of the Community are preparing for further cuts.
By June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres report, thousands of people are already being displaced each year.
Farrell said that if the federal government’s decision is not revoked, the situation will only worsen.
“Community legal centers in Queensland are chronically underfunded, meaning that every year thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrolled and rampant debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers – all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they don’t get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent in June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents are forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without help.
We urge the Justice Minister and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its pledge to raise the funding of legal assistance to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and its client communities, and the Palaszczuk Board should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after a worker allegedly threatened with a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued in court for allegedly not doing anything after being told that the campaign's North Carolina operations chief threatened a worker with a gun in February while they were driving a jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed by former state campaign software trainer Vincent Bordin on Wednesday in a state court in Charlotte.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be addressed internally before realizing that “it’t happen.”
Commander Earl Phillip “raised the gun, placed his right front finger on the slider and pushed the spark against Vincent’s knee,” Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After apologizing to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had a similar experience with Phillip, the lawsuit said.
“We don’t have to shoot weapons to cause damage,” Bordini said in a lawsuit.
The challenge comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate provoked outrage by telling the public in North Carolina that “the people of the second addition”—which generally refers to gun owners and gun enthusiasts—could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to elect judges.
Trump’s campaign said the media has taken his words out of context, and that he does not advocate violence.
Bordin’s challenge is to claim compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance and from Phillip for violence, abuse and causing emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the request for comment.
The attempts to reach Phillips failed.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlotte, that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
His call request to his consultancy Innovative Consulting Services was not immediately answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and prosperity to the entire stomach, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was the charm of the 2012 London Games, when we did an enormous effort to ensure that all of our people and region benefited from the races.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we do so again by creating opportunities for local people and near Heathrow.
It will create 10,000 new internships and 40,000 new jobs for local communities alone, and eliminate youth unemployment around the airport.
Just like before the 2012 London Olympics, some come to think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the tournament and that we would be ashamed in the face of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and £211 billion in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget: from the T5 which has been voted the world’s best airport terminal for five years in a row, to the T2, which was built between the world’s two busiest runways.
Now the team is ready to implement a third track, supported by £16 billion of private funding.
The 2012 London Olympics were a huge success for Britain, and I am convinced that the Heathrow expansion will be the same.
It is time to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, secure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former trade secretary of the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in cat and mouse game to block ads
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to bypass the ad-blocking program are “cat and mouse play,” said one of the companies producing such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its pages accessed on computers, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users could upgrade the program’s filters to block ads on the pages of the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said its website code will be exchanged around ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it has circulated a new code.
In a blog post, Ben Williams, a spokesman for Adblock, wrote that “this kind of back-to-back battle between the open-source ad-blocking community and its brokers has been ongoing since the invention of ad-blocking,” and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the struggle is a strong indication of how much trouble ad blockers have come to the industry.
Around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year.This is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1,03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is following the ad blockers on pages accessed on the computer, as mobile ad blockers don’t work in Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue to make Facebook consider this kind of action worth investing.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its “advertising preferences” tool to give people more power over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the site’s non-advertising content.
“This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to address the problem,” a Facebook spokesman said in an email statement.
Ad-blockers are dull tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman dropped under a car on a Swiss highway due to suicide
He was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for eyewitnesses after a woman fell under several vehicles on the highway in early hours of Thursday in a case that was apparently a suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in Vaud Canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman committed a “desperate act” and lay down in the dark on the road where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to commit suicide, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was struck by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, police said, urging them and all eyewitnesses to appear.
A criminal investigation has been launched, which is a “logical” step in such a situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genève.
It remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid the collision?
It is up to the prosecutor to decide,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar incidents in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held accountable.
In both cases - where there was a person walking on a dark highway in both cases - it was estimated that drivers could not expect to encounter a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, the police were acquitted of charges of negligence after he struck and killed a man lying on A!-road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drunk and stalled on the road, the court said.
The court found that the police, who were responding to the emergency call, were driving in a justified way, and that the man’s presence on the road was “a totally extraordinary and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to estimates from NASA’s new climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to find out whether Venus, with its hot, water-free surfaces and carbon-filled atmosphere, could sometimes have Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, and it could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the surface formation of the early Venus.
The planet probably had areas drier than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to enable life and protect against rapid water evaporation.
The advantage of early Venus was also a 30 percent dimmer sun.
“In a GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its sunshine to the Sun for almost two months at a time,” GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain, creating a thick cloud layer that acts like a umbrella protecting the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average climate temperature is actually a few degrees cooler than Earth’s current temperature.
The model produced a story about the evolution stages of Venus that is similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was probably sometimes habitable, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with its deadly greenhouse gas effects remained - the Venus we know today.
The researchers shared the findings of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy to resign as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as Colorado Avalanche coach and deputy chief hockey officer on Thursday, saying he lacked influence in the team’s decision-making process.
Colorado Vice President/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start searching for a new coach immediately.
“Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Deputy Chief Hockey Officer and Chief Coach of Colorado Avalanche with enthusiasm, passion and determination,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
During the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To this, the view of the coach and the Deputy Chief Hockey Officer must be fully aligned with the vision of the organization.
He must also be able to influence decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are not currently fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick told me today about his decision,” Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the League's Best Coach for his first Avalanche season 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a victory in the middle division, but Minnesota defeated Colorado in the first round of the drop-off games, and the team has not been able to continue in the last two years.
Avalanche's games in the 2015-16 season ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 drawings, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing the West Conference wild card drop.
Roy, a goalkeeper in the Hall of Fame, won four Stanley Cups - two in both the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
Oil workers in the North Sea continue negotiations and postpone strike
North Sea oil workers' work struggles for wages will be postponed as all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, leading negotiators said.
The strikes against the oil field service company Wood Group have occasionally been organized at Royal Dutch Shell-led drilling platforms in the North Sea.
“The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process aimed at resolving the current dispute,” the joint statement read.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
The unions say their recent work struggle, which they say is the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut the commissions of North Sea contractors by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company’s fee reduction follows a 10% reduction in contractors in its countries from 2014.
The company said the additional cuts would give the company the necessary room to cope with the decline in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of people from its salaries and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as the company eases its operations as a result of its giant merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is worsened by Britain’s decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the generation’s biggest North Sea labour disputes.
He said the North Sea is essential to the region’s economy.
“We need an economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and across the country,” he said in a statement.
Investments in new projects in the North Sea are expected to be less than $1.4 billion in 2016, compared with an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measured the speed of the stars in the Plejadic star cluster
The latest Kepler Space Telescope mission has helped astronomers compile the most complete list of the speed of rotation of the stars in the Pleiadian cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at varying speeds, and how rotation times are related to planet formation.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we can now learn more about the relationship between the star’s mass, its age, and even its solar system history,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Pasadena Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis.
The Plejadic star cluster is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are now reaching adulthood.
They are now at their highest level.
At their peak speed of rotation, these adult stars shoot large amounts of star winds.
As these winds pass through the star's magnetic fields, they brake the stars.
As a star ages, its speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by tracking the appearance of identifiable star spots, such as solar spots.
The latest list of star rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars are rotating slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, of whom the larger make piruets slower than the smaller.
“In the ‘balet’ of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while the fastest rotors tend to be very lightweight stars,” Rebull said.
Because the Plejadic cluster is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for evaluating the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
“The Plejadic cluster provides an anchor for the rotation of stars into theoretical models that encompass both directions, younger and older,” Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, why, and why the stars slow down their rotation and so-called hang their “dance shoes” on their nails.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Pleiades in three articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
