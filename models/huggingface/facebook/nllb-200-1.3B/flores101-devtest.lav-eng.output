Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had colours, which was already a widely held theory, but it also provides information that fossils generally cannot, like colour and three-dimensional positioning.
Scientists say that the animal's complexion was chestnut on the top and carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also provides insight into the development of bird color.
Since dinosaur tusks did not have a well-developed tail, called a stalk, but had the characteristics of other tusks, such as spines and scales, the researchers concluded that the stalk was likely evolved later than these characteristics.
The color structure suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or display. The researchers noted that although this is a new dinosaur's tail, the sample shows the coloration of an adult bird, not a young dragon.
The researchers suggested that although this was a new dinosaur line, the sample showed the discoloration of an adult, not a baby dragon.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Milky Way.
The effect the team is looking for could be caused by the gravitational forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon affects the Earth by causing tidal changes, the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists could conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and it's made up of many tiny particles.

Candidates may send representatives to observe each part of the process.

The accused are identified as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered a severe head injury.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed until emergency services pulled the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Greatermouth.
He was then transferred to the Adebroke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been remanded in custody by the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on suspicion of murdering his son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the eyewitness testimony may be invalid because her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system operates differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
"Journalists seem to be going off the rails by publishing suspicious photos and other information", notes Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for the charges in general, has told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the moment of the charges.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the dispute over the borders claimed by Palestine based on the border situation before the 1967 Middle East war.
The subjects discussed included the status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel has requested a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years after the signing of the agreement, but PI has agreed to such a presence for only five years.
The forestry operators had to be careful with the shooters who participated in the additional pest control trial, as this trial was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
The NPWS and the NSW partnership and the NSW hunting programme attracted qualified volunteers.
According to Mika O'Flynn, the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) site executive director for conservation and cultural heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation were given comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday as a member of the new nine-member Interim Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martel's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission pushed for the early departure of CEP as part of a package of measures designed to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was in Martell√≠ in response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
In some cases, the failure to hold elections has led to violent protests, some since 2011.
Some 60 cases of iPod malfunction due to overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires, with four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reports that it is aware of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "non-essential".
The Ministry responded by calling the delay in the Apple report 'really regrettable'.
The quake struck Mariano at 7:19 am local time on Friday at 21:19 GMT.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Bureau reported no casualties in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been released so far, but at least six have been confirmed dead.
The six hostages, including children and elderly people, as well as photographers from the Philippines, were quickly released.
The photographer later took the place of the elderly lady, because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Ligin followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and began working at the Oakland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study preterm birth in his spare time.
His research shows that when given a hormone, it accelerates the breakdown of the fetal lungs.
The Xinhua news agency reported that on Wednesday, government investigators recovered two "black boxes" of flight data recorders.
Luna was also honored by other biscuits that were her companions.
Tommy Dreamer said, "The Moon was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. The Moon died on the night when two Moons were visible.
Dustin Rannels, known as "Goldust", commented that "Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even stranger... I love her and I miss her... I think she's in the best place now".
Of the 1,400 residents surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people who objected to Australia becoming a republic had risen by 8 percent from 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed that Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This is the view of 34% of those who want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The poll's mixed results show that 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaint has put his fitness in doubt.
He shouldn't have taken pain medication, which is a banned anti-inflammatory in these games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, revealed the largest known prime number to date.
By early February, the discovery had been verified by a number of people using various hardware and software, and was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have brought water to Earth along with organic matter that can make proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially the Earth, because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Kuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the fun "political nonsense and nonsense".
He is also a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology rather than older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the location of pilots and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional vehicles are planned, no surface trains will stop at Wembley Stadium, and parking and 'new' and 'riding' facilities will not be available at this location.
Fears of lack of transportation increased the possibility that the game would be played behind closed doors without a team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that the new species had been born in just two generations, although this process was thought to take considerably longer, given the breeding of the endemic Darwin's frog (Geospiza fortes) and the migratory cactus frog (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be cast into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into even the most delicate shapes.
It can be stretched like a little string, which you can pull and sew, or you can bend it or make leaves.
It can be made very flat and attached to another metal, and it can be so flat that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It's called the chemical pH, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice varies depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic (salty).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in the compound pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons with separated electrons (the hydrogen atom is composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze them into the ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation and forming a kind of shroud.
In the cities of Harap and Mohenjo-daro, nearly every house had a toilet with a water sewer connected to a complex sewer system.
Wastewater system debris has been found in the town of Minois (Crete) and on the island of Santorini (Greece).
The toilet was also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in the Roman civilization, the toilet was sometimes part of a public bath, where men and women walked together in a mixed society.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use satellite.
In space, the satellite receives a call and then almost immediately reflects it back.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere absorbs some of our light and vision.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a giant rocket that is over 100 feet high.
Riten has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing that Riten has done for us is to make transportation easier and faster.
It has given us trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
Then there are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and cherries.
Finally, there are many small cats (including the stray house cat), which eat far more of all kinds of small prey, such as insects, rodents, cherries, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche - a specific task that each cat does and that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most common cat species, living in large groups called herds.
The brood consists of one to three mated adult males and up to 30 females and young.
Mothers are usually closely related to one another, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion cubs behave like wolves or dogs  both animals behave remarkably similarly to lions (but not other big cats)  and are just as deadly to their prey.
The athlete tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, make long jumps, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, the only four cats that can swim.
The tiger's voice is not like the lion's full voice, but rather like a grunting, slurred word sentence.
The ocelots like to eat small animals, and when they can, they catch monkeys, rats, rodents, and birds.
Scientists believe that the ocelots can detect and find prey by smell, by tracking the tracks they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also very good at moving.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example, if it moves along a mountain range or a river or moves to a new island so that it cannot so easily move back), it often finds itself in a different environment than the one it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be more powerful competitors than they should have been before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as new residents begin to adapt to their new environment, they become less and less like other residents.
Eventually, thousands or millions of years from now, the two populations will look so different that they won't be able to be called one species.
We call this process speciation, which just means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, but they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants take their nutrients from the sun by photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We make our homes out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
The Moosaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything except other Moosaurus.
Its long jaws contained more than 70 very sharp teeth, plus extra teeth on the front of the mouth, so that no one who came across it had a chance of escape.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a tongue of a dactylic type, feeding on arthropods, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water, which a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not have been able to do.
While most Roman food is familiar to us, they also had some strange and unusual festive foods, including wild boar, peas, slugs, and a rodent called a sausage.
Another difference was that the poor and the women ate in chairs, while the rich men enjoyed feasting together, lying on their sides during the meal.
Ancient Roman cuisine certainly did not include products that were only introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever grown tartar meat.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods, but the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs by conducting ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open inner courtyard and an open sanctuary, which was reserved for priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called zikurates were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Near East, a house was not that important.
Most Jewish families lived abroad.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were simple, alley-facing sheds; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the old Scandinavian legend says that Eric Rudge was banished from Iceland for murder in the thirties, and that he went further west and discovered a land called Greenland.
But despite his discovery, there was already an Eskimo tribe living there.
Although each was a "Scandinavian" country, the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differed greatly.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasures", you might think that the treasure map was painted on the other side of the Declaration of Independence.
But that is not true. Even though there is a note on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words on the back of the Declaration of Independence read: "The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text is shown in reverse at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large parchment document (293‚ÅÑ4 x 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was rolled up and stored shortly after it was made.
So the note is probably just attached as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still unliberated.
It was run by "All France", the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were cooperating with the invaders, not at war with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, calling it Operation Dragon.
Within two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were moving toward Germany.
Civilization is a particular culture, made up of an extremely large group of people who live and work in cooperation with one another, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", which means civilian, and is related to the Latin word "civi", which means citizen, and "civias", which means city or city state, and that also defines the size of society in a way.
The culture of civilization means the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the continuing influence of culture and its steady spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving a substantial record of history, and they are not recognized as full civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states, based on the Articles of Confederation, for the first time established a weak central government, the only component of which was the Congress.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since it had no national executive or judicial power, it relied on government agencies, often uncooperative, to enforce any laws it passed.
Nor did it have the power to abolish tax laws and tariffs between countries.
The amendment of the charter required the unanimous consent of all the states, but the states were so lenient with the central government that their representatives often did not appear.
The Italian national football team, as well as the German national football team, are the second most successful team in the world, having also won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, boxing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in both international and Olympic games.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because Japan is made up of several islands, it is often called an "archipel" geographically
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors who passed through the island spelled the name "Ilha Formosa", or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning to transform the local population's grain-growing practices and employing Chinese laborers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qin Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and announced the incorporation of Taiwan as a province into the Qin Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qin dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereign control over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The city of Pichu consists of three main buildings, namely, the Intuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been remodeled to give tourists a better understanding of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of the Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the most common photographic film size in the analogue photographic age.
It's still in production, but more importantly, its image proportions are now used in digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format set) correspond to or are very similar to these image aspect ratios.
The much-deformed and often-mocked third-party rule is a simple guide that creates dynamics while maintaining image order.
It states that the most efficient place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts, both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had grown rich and powerful, was in shambles.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united the nations of Europe despite their different languages and traditions.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are intended for that very purpose.
The centrality of the church in Rome has existed for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has caused many to question whether this principle is being observed.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a blockade of the German fleet.
The strategy has proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violates generally accepted international law, codified in several international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering the entire ocean, which threatened even neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, pacifism and isolation were the main priorities of the majority of the population and the nation.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repeat of the same situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to start work for the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his manager at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way to describe different time periods; each stage of Chinese development or each family in power was a different dynasty.
In addition, there was a period of unstable provincial division between each dynasty, most notably the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a vicious battle for the throne was fought between many nobles.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the top spot in the great Sichuan Palace.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, all male candidates could apply for jobs, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true in the military field, where ranks were now awarded on the basis of personal qualities rather than rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in worldly matters, and he often went to the peak, which became known as Mount Hira al-Nura (Mountain of Light), to make amends.
The very fact that the area has survived the ravages of time is a clear indication of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
Ala is located on a mountain top north of Mecca and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if one knows it exists.
Nothing but clear, beautiful skies above us and many mountains around us is visible. From inside the ring, not much of the outside world is seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many giant pyramid structures erected in honor of the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is made up of several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Heops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of Heops' wives and family members.
The upper sign looks like a V and the 'downward' looks like a square or square without a lower edge.
Up means you should start at the curve and press your elbow, down means you should start at the handle (the place where your hand is between your legs) and pull your elbow.
The upward movement of the lobe usually produces a softer sound, whereas the downward movement is stronger and more convincing.
You can mark your notes, but remember that the notes you print are for musical goodness purposes, so they are usually to be followed.
The late King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 years old Marie-Th√©r√®se and four years old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister Madame Elisabeth were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by the efforts of the market women.
In the company of a carriage party, they returned to Paris, threatening the king and queen.
Human effort forced the king and queen to open the chariot's locks wide.
At one point, a member of the band drew the head of the royal guard, who had been killed at Versailles, before the terrified queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of their expenses, and interest on bonds on behalf of the Philippine government flowed through Wall Street bank houses.
Of course, the profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people formed the basis of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the temples, one must understand the environment that motivated the establishment of the order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 B.C.E.).
Before the Middle Ages, there was the Early Middle Ages, and after the Middle Ages, there was the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from a technological trend or technological imperative to the strict understanding that human destiny is governed by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their expression in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism distinguish two main ideas: technological development itself is largely outside the cultural or political sphere, and technology itself creates "impacts" on societies, and these impacts are derivative rather than socially conditioned.
For example, you might say that the car certainly contributes to the development of roads.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for a small number of cars and new production methods have been developed to reduce the costs of car use.
The increased number of private cars also means more accidents, which leads to new methods of treating injuries in health care.
Romanticism was largely influenced by cultural determinism, which emerged from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schneidel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography influenced people, and over time, cultures and images associated with the respective geographical regions were created that were better than arbitrarily imposed laws because they were in harmony with the place of society.
Just as Paris is today considered the fashion capital of the world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as a center of luxury goods from about 400 C.E. to about 1100.
Its status declined in the 12th century as the Crusaders returned with gifts of linen and spices, which were valued higher than those available in the Byzantine markets.
It was during this time that Constantinople lost its title of fashion capital, but Paris regained it.
The Gothic style gained popularity in the 10th-11th century and later in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, because of slow communication channels, fashion in the West may be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest achievements of the time was the use of rags as a reinforcement during the Crusades.
Self-sufficient farming is farming that is carried out to produce sufficient food and satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sustaining farming is a simple, often organic system, using seeds collected in an ecoregion together with soil or other relatively simple methods to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers have been self-employed, as is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel left out by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of participants.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Subculture representatives often emphasise their belonging by using distinctive and symbolic styles, including fashion, manners and jargon.
One of the most common techniques used to illustrate the importance of socialization is the failure of children whose parents did not provide them with socialization during their childhood because of neglect, difficulty, or deliberate abuse.
Some wild children have been restricted by humans (usually their parents), and in some cases the child's adoption was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe violence or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some say they have lived in the wild alone.
When fully raised with animals, a wild child is characterized by almost the same behavior (with physical limitations) as the animal in charge, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Project-based learning should make the training process easier and more interesting, but project-based learning is a step forward.
The support approach is not a learning method but rather a means of supporting people who are learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, like a teacher being a support, but also a little human being in Microsoft Office.
Virtual meetings are internalised in the software and are designed to ask, present and explain procedures that might be difficult for the student to solve on his own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, violence, and even coercion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, loving, and educational, and yet it is.
We think the foster system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our system of fostering children in foreign countries must provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The logs must be provided with all the necessary supplies that were missing from the houses from which they were removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet create additional dimensions in terms of the approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are cited as important motivating factors for internet use (James et al., 1995).
In their study of the target audience's reaction to websites, Eimy and McCord (1998) also identified as new motivating aspects personal involvement and persistent relationships.
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell whether someone is lying by correctly interpreting micro-facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks in his essay "The Presidential Speech" showed how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately determine how true it is.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior might be present in animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, but selection subtracts it from the set of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination in each generation caused variation back and forth between these two sets.
Primates with digestive systems like humans have difficulty obtaining the necessary amino acids from the naturally available plant resources.
Moreover, it can have serious consequences - stunted growth, malnutrition, and even death.
The easiest plant resources would have been the protein found in leaves and shoots, but it's hard for primates like us to digest unless we make it.
In contrast, animal foods (meat, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also rich in protein, which contains essential amino acids.
So, it's not surprising that our ancestors solved their protein problem in the same way that chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling back to sleep for a short time (1060 minutes).
It's easy to do this by using a relatively quiet modulator, so you're conscious but not fully awake.
If you switch the tablecloth during sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, causing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another reason for biorhythm is to drink plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known to be diuretic) before bedtime to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace in a person is the reciprocal of the amount of feeling in a person's body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force that exists, and each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is within the reach of anyone, and the only thing that prevents us from achieving it is our own judgment and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana way of love and many of the Indian yoga methods.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path to all-embracing love.
During the practice of Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini (clearness) energy is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Deity, through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, so the USSR and the United States cooperated. After the war, the two countries became hostile again because of their different systems, processes, and cultures.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and with the help of the postwar armies, it carried out real warfare in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenders had been disbanded, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize alongside the Romanian garrison.
However, these plans morally became obsolete in a matter of days when more than 800,000 Soviet Union Red Army soldiers arrived and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying eastern Polish regions in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of ships for the transport of goods remains the most efficient way of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's mission has traditionally been to ensure that your nation maintains its ability to move its people and goods while preventing the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German fleet, using mostly submarines, tried to stop the encounter.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have conquered Britain, as would all other European nations.
The first cattle were probably bred in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient peoples and tribes cultivated them for their milk, wool, meat, and leather.
Household goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills and other grazing areas, and were watched by goat herds, often children or adults, as well as the more widely known sheep herds.
Carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the horse railways consisted of only wooden beams placed parallel to each other, they allowed the draught horses to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than the gravel roads of the time.
The use of floors was very early in the development of motionless slides, but gradually it was realized that slides would be even more effective if they had a metal layer on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels of the larger wagons to break.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and the first all-iron railway was introduced in 1767.
The first known form of movement was walking, and people began walking standing up two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as they did.
Two-legged features have already been found in fossils of the Australopithecus supergiant, which lived 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although members of the sahelanthropic genus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement and even be activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause and deactivate it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of human advancement in science and technology, and the problems have been exacerbated by survival and extravagant lifestyles.
After it passed Congress on July 4, the draft document, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was sent to the John Dunlap printing press a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced overnight, which are now known as Dunlap broadsides (Declaration of Independence).
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the hall of Independence Hall on July 8.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9 he read it to his clerk in New York.
25 The "broadsides" of duns known to have survived are the oldest copies of a document that have survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today, and we call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But birds still have many features that resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with hooves and claws, they lay eggs and walk on both of their hind legs like a tyrannosaur.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only two digits, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or  bits in computer language.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently common to not prompt a diagnosis.
The most obvious sign of internal intoxication may be the presence of open containers of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Read the label for the first aid instructions for the specific dose.
The term "wabble" is used in a formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient association with bed bugs, which are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both predatory and blood-sucking insects are parasitic pests that have adapted to life in the intestines or in other bodies.
With approximately 400,000 cases of MS in the United States, it is considered the most common neurological disease in young adults and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may choose to set up an adoption plan for their baby.
In the case of adoption, the birth parents are deprived of parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works by using the scientific method, which is actually the driving force behind most scientific research.
There's also experimentation, and an experiment is a test that's used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all sciences, including psychology.
As fewer people learned Greek, the West became alienated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The development and process of endogenous cycles, taking into account the biological pulse, often has a decisive influence on many observed rhythms in psychology and behaviour.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic signals, are valid for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological particles are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to operate freely even without external stimuli.
The Hersh and Chase experiment was one of the leading proponents of DNA as genetic material.
Hersh and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, either marking the DNA of the fungi with radioactive phosphorus or marking the fungi with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the unit of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are cells of the parent cell line.
Only mutations in the cells of the parent cell line can be passed on to children, but mutations in other cells can cause cell damage or cancer.
Nature tourism brings together people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy landscapes, including plants and wildlife.
These places are for hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, or for visiting parks and exploring the ecosystem.
For example, we visited the island of Borneo to take pictures and learn about orangutans.
Every morning, people from small rural towns drive to their jobs, and others arrive who are based in the same place they just left.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is connected in some way and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Now scientists point out that the economy, with its massive carbon emissions, has broken one of the stable states of the biosphere that have underpinned human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and participates in transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or broken bridges.
Why do we have such complaints about transport systems, why do they have problems every day, are the transport engineers incompetent, or are the problems deeper?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their possible interactions.
Unfortunately, traffic flow is difficult to study, since it is impossible to predict the driver's behavior with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, the range of driver behaviour is usually quite consistent, so that some consistency can be determined for traffic flows and calculated approximately mathematically.
In order to better reflect the traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and processes of the transport infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and to find food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings backward, folding them along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot spread their wings are the multicellular spiders and the unicorns.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite: that the solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
That makes sense, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it holds more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching six miles in some places.
The Amazon is responsible for 20 percent of the water flowing into the ocean from all the rivers in the world.
The Amazon basin is 3,980 miles [6,387 km] long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza Pyramids were unprecedented in their size and engineering excellence.
The ancient Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at the time.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the daily language of most of the working people in that country, but Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the chemical elements of gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, for they are all found in nature in free form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of one or more specific elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they would change into new substances to make what we see.
The compound is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
Alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon may also be present.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a single dot at the end of this sentence would be made up of trillions of atoms.
So when the brand was born, it was a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing styles, the symbol's status declined and its use became less common.
Now people are typing messages on a computer screen, and there's no need for a blood donor.
We can only imagine how the keyboard will change when a new invention comes along.
The atom works on the principle that it takes energy to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
In a way, it's like hanging a heavy wheel on a mountain, and when you split the nuclear reactor, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and that means they tend to split with little stimulus or just like that.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The Garoza is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner below the basal plane and thicker below the uppermost.
The near side could have more of the Moon Sea, because the mantle is shallower, and the lava would have been easier to lift to the surface.
Content theory is basically trying to figure out what inspires people or what connects them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that, upon reaching adulthood, are internalized.
These theories look at what makes certain people want to do the things they do and what the environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Typically, there are two types of behavior that can occur in managers who are starting to lead their former colleagues.
Such leaders have difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, performing performance evaluations, assigning accountability, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, the leader becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to completely change everything the team has done so far and turn it into their own accomplishment.
Ultimately, the leader is solely responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
This often causes a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual commands are subject to the same standards of excellence as regular commands, but there are slight differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet at different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (page 109, Larson and LaFast, 1989 ed.) is also part of a unique virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team, to which each participant reports.
Why would an organisation want to invest time in the process of building such a timely learning organisation?One of the reasons why concepts are put into practice in a learning organisation is innovation.
Creativity and innovation can be unleashed when all available resources are used effectively in the functional areas of the organisation.
The resulting process, where the organisation works together to overcome the barrier, can facilitate the development of new, innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can innovate, managers need to create a culture of innovation as well as an organisation that shares knowledge and is constantly learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method used to help organisations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide a theoretical approach to the study of physical evidence-detection capabilities, thus narrowing the field of study and making it more precise.
Scientists are supported in their research by the correlation between brain pathology and behavior.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumor affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
Although AI is largely associated with science fiction, it is an extremely important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and adaptation of technology to intelligent beings.
In AI research, machines are made to automate tasks that require programmable actions to perform.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer questions and make diagnoses, and the ability to recognize handwriting, voices and faces.
These have become separate sectors with a focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it is embedded in a number of home computer and video game software applications.
The school bus is a big part of the learning process, and often the teacher is the one who takes the students to places where the bus is not available.
Technology offers a solution through virtual learning tours, where students can sit with classmates and view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire fine art.
Virtual learning tour sharing is a great way to discuss the tour and share experiences with the next classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year, that website is redesigned, but the previous versions are kept online as a history album.
Emouars can also help improve students' writing skills, although students often do not pay attention to grammar and spelling when they first start writing emouars, but the presence of readers usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical of the target audience, the author of the emerald begins to work on improving his writing to avoid criticism.
Moreover, writing emouar "allows students to broaden their knowledge of the world around them". The need to keep the reader interested motivates students to be compassionate and interesting. - Toto, 2004.
Writing an emoji is a technique that encourages collaboration and encourages students to learn outside of school hours.
The appropriate use of emouar "can stimulate students to become more analytical and critical. By actively using the materials available on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of other written content and express their views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, with its many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is the Niagara Falls, and further north is the pristine natural beauty of Muskogee.
All of this and more makes Ontario what some consider to be the real Canada.
Large areas farther north are sparsely populated, and in some places are as uninhabited as forested areas.
A surprising population comparison: The number of African-Americans in the United States is much larger than the population of Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and in terms of wildlife, it is like a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are associated with France, and are also known as luxury beach resorts.
Islam was also introduced in Arab lands, in Comoros and in Mayotte on a large scale.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered a route from Europe to India along the Cape of Good Hope.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel region and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: all women travelling are required to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to take off a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to situations that they may consider to be embarrassing, and it is not unusual for a woman to be followed, held at arm's length, etc.
Don't be afraid to say no to men and turn their attention away (whether or not they are culturally different, it's not acceptable).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. The Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casabranca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco renamed the city Dar el-Badija, and Spanish traders who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping spots in all of Morocco.
In the old city of Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as taverns, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and all kinds of jewelry, but these are only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located on the eastern border of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which has covered most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is safe enough, all visits outside Goma should be reviewed to understand the current fighting situation in North Kivu Province.
The town is also a starting point for climbing the Niragongo volcano along some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking sites in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi).
Because of its relative difficulty of access, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and an airport.
In 1990, it was inscribed on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the threat posed by desert sands.
It was one of the main ports where the PBS documentary "The Wonders of the African World" was filmed by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country because it has more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and straddles the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which hosts different wildlife.
It is one of the main sites of the South African Survey and is considered the most important of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there is a daily subsistence and entrance fee.
It may also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card which provides access to certain South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong is the name of Hong Kong Island, and it is a major tourist destination.
The landscape of Hong Kong is like a mirror-image of a strip of land, as illustrated by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, head away from the island to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most urban development in Hong Kong is tightly confined to reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a place that the British colonists took over as their own, and so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbani is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 50 miles (80 km) from the coastline of Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent.
Sundarbani is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A part of the forest in India is called Sundarbani National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remaining jungle growths that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbani has an area of 3850 km2, of which about one third is wetland/swampland.
Since 1966, Sanderbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 plankton-billed deer now live in the area.
Buses leave from the intercity bus station (across the river) all day, but most, especially the eastbound and Jakarta/Bumtang routes, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese shore buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shuttle taxis offer a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Bhutanese beaches) and Punakhu (200 Bhutanese beaches).
The Ojap√≥ River Bridge is an old bridge that spans the Ojap√≥ River to connect the city of Ojap√≥, Brazil, to Saint-Georges-de-Loyap√≥, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 232 feet [83 m], are 1,378 feet [378 m] long, and have two lanes of 12 feet [3.50 m] wide.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 metres.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control posts are scheduled to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in natural agriculture.
Other indigenous groups, such as the Guaicuru and the Payaga, lived in the Chaco region, and they supported themselves by hunting, foraging, and fishing.
Once called the "Province of the Great Indies", Paraguay was created in the 16th century by the interaction of Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Canuitas Polo Grounds.
Minor tournaments and bouts are also held here several other times a year.
For information on tournaments and places where tickets to polo matches can be purchased, please visit the website of the "Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo".
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Shilling (FKP), which is set at the equivalent of one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
British pounds are generally accepted at all locations on the islands, while credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted at Stanley.
Credit cards may not be accepted in the outlying islands, although British and US currencies may be accepted; ask the cardholders in advance to find out what payment methods are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to change the Falkland Islands currency outside the island territory, so change your money before you go.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is there when winter is in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; temperatures in the summer months usually exceed the +30 ¬∞C mark.
Winter can be subtly wet: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but when wind and humidity are present, it seems colder than the thermometer would indicate.
There is no distinct rainy and dry season: the amount of rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, wild animals are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park's management guidelines, a minimum distance of 100 yards/m from bears and wolves and 25 yards/m from all other wildlife must be observed!
As submissive as they may seem, buffaloes, elk, North American elk, bears, and all other large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because they do not keep proper distances. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so it is best to keep them at arm's length.
Also, remember that scents are associated with bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking flavored foods and keep your camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous 1889 sea-running when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful rally in the city center turns into the assassination of the supreme ruler of Tupua, Tamasese Lealofi III.
The two ports of Auckland provide many beaches, the most popular being in three territories.
The North Shore (in the province of North Harbor) is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and stretches from the Gulf of Long Beach in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and shaded by poplar trees.
Tamakidrive Beach is located in the port of Waitemata, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Helens in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops located on the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not a tasty beer but a delicious and refreshing one.
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australia are more popular.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're scared, bottled water is easy to find.
Black coffee is called espresso, cappuccino is made with a giant spoonful of powder (not milk powder), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they're excellent.
Although the reef is used year-round, injuries are rare in the reef for these reasons.
However, listen to the authorities, take note of all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The Cubedus appeared on the beaches and riverbanks of the northern part of the city from October to April 1770, and they are sometimes found at other times.
Sharks are common, but they rarely attack humans, and most shark-like creatures are afraid of humans and usually swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not commonly found in the ocean; their main habitat is in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers the peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
The Commission notes that the airport services agreement between Ryanair and Ryanair is not binding on Ryanair.
They can also save you a reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be sent first to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the majority of visitors choose to live in tents, and most of them consider this to be an essential part of the festival experience.
If you want to be close to the epicenter, you have to arrive early to find a campground that's close to the music.
Remember: Even if the music on the main stages has already stopped playing, there may be venues at the festival where the music will continue to play into the late night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the iceberg, since crossing the ice creates a rather terrible noise for those most affected.
The cruise ships of Saint Petersburg provide time for sightseeing.
Casinos usually do their best to keep their guests as long as possible and to get them to spend more money.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and in their rooms.
Alcoholic beverages are offered on the premises, but alcohol impairs judgment, and any good gambler knows the importance of keeping his head above water.
Anyone planning to drive in polar regions or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
The snow and snow-covered roads are not very crowded, so you cannot drive on the same path as on the clean asphalt.
In a very short time, snow storms can bring down so much snow that it can cause a landslide.
Visibility may also be restricted by snow, birds, condensate or ice falling on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries, so traffic is mostly uninterrupted year-round.
Safari trips are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most exciting experience for many visitors.
The popular term "safari" refers to travels overland to explore the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as the lion and the giraffe, are close to cars, so standard equipment will allow for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes bald, and they are best seen with binoculars.
A safari (also called a "crouching walk", "safari walk", or "walking") is a walk that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, including the 1964 Games.
If you booked flights and hotels for 2020 before the delay notice, you may have found yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation rules vary, but at the end of March most coronavirus pandemic-related cancellation rules are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between ¬•2500 and ¬•130,000, with standard tickets costing around ¬•7000.
Many hotels may require a stretcher and a mattress if they are not available in the room.
If a mattress is not available or you do not like wearing a trained jacket, you may want to try using a fan, if one is available.
Try not to overheat the fabric (which may cause it to break or even wear out in the end).
There are many different types of water treatment, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is enough, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their efficiency, so if in doubt, consider buying bottled water from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter animal parasites unknown to them in their home regions.
Pests can eat food, cause inflammation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread the virus or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases by themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans are not generally considered to be pests.
Duty-free purchases are the possibility to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway between Pointmarie and Fairmont creates the most challenging driving conditions, often crossing isolated rural areas.
If you are not used to country roads, beware of steep stairs, narrow lanes and winding roads.
The speed limits allowed are significantly lower than the previous and subsequent road sections  usually 3540 mph (5664 km/h)  and it is even more important to strictly observe them.
But strangely, cell phone signals are much stronger here than on other roads, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cuisine is quite enjoyable, and in Bavaria it is very rich and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit cakes with apple fillings are available year-round, while cherries and plums are also available in summer.
Many German confectionery products include almonds, cranberry extracts, and other tree extracts, which are often a favorite of cake makers, especially when paired with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small, strong, rich snack, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made from meat or vegetables with spices and seasonings.
Curry can be either "dry" or "fresh" depending on the amount of liquid.
Inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian cuisine is characterised by the wide variety of the country's regional cuisines, offering a choice of 17 000 islands.
However, without further explanation, this term usually refers to food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The traditional cooking of the beef, now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a wide range of simple, spicy dishes, with the dominant flavors of peanut, chili, sugar (especially coconut sugar) and various flavoring spices.
The horn-climbers are the supports of the rider's legs, which fight on each side of the horn.
They provide greater stability for the animal but may raise safety concerns as the animal's legs may become embedded in them.
If a rider is dropped from a horse but his leg is caught in the saddle, the rider may be dragged to the ground if the horse runs away.
First, most shepherds wear shepherd's shoes with a heel and a glove, a rather narrow sash.
Furthermore, some sails, especially English sails, have safety rails that allow the leather straps to fall off the sails, causing the rider to fall and roll them over the back.
The Valley of the Coaches  Chile's premier cliff climbing site, known as South America's Yosemite, features a variety of giant granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from the cliffs, and climbers from all over the world are constantly making new routes through its endless cliff walls.
Mountain sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with a sled or snow-sail attached to the feet.
For many enthusiasts (known as "ski booms") hiding is a basic occupation of travel, and they plan all their vacations around hiding in a certain place.
The idea of sleeping is very old - pottery paintings depicting sleeping people date back to 5,000 B.C.E.!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking: This activity is also known as backpacking, ski tourism or skiing.
This is related to, but not always involves, mountaineering or alpinism; in the latter case, these activities take place on steeper slopes and require more stringent hiding places and fences.
Think of a ski route as a similar route to a cross-country ski.
Under good conditions you can cover greater distances than you can walk  but you will rarely be able to reach the speed of long-distance skiing without a heavy back and ready track.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would involve countless visa applications and passport controls.
However, in this respect the Schengen area operates in a manner similar to that of a single country.
If you are in this territory, you can normally cross the border without re-checking your passport at border control points.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen Member State individually, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes antique goods.
The definition has geographical differences where the age limit in places such as North America may be lower than in Europe.

In remote areas where there is no mobile network coverage, satellite may be the only viable option.
Satellite telephony is not quite the same as a mobile phone, because you need to be outside and on a direct line to the satellite to make a call.
The service is commonly used in shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions requiring remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider will be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
For those who plan to take advantage of their study breaks, travel and studying are becoming increasingly popular.
It is particularly popular among high school graduates, allowing them to use the year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, a year of interruption in a course in another country may even improve the possibility of resuming higher education in the country of residence.
Normally, tuition fees will be charged for admission to these educational programmes.
Finland is a great place for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also includes thousands of islands in an archipelago of lakes or coastlines.
In the archipelago and on the lakes, a yacht is not always necessary.
While the coastal archipelago and the larger lakes are indeed large enough to sail on any yacht, trips in smaller boats or even kayaking offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one in seven or eight inhabitants owning a boat.
This is the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands, the figure is 1 in 40).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that when you return and spend the night on the ship, you can visit the historic city for a few days.
If you are only going to the coast for boat trips, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise ship brochures mention Berlin, Germany, and as you can see from the map, the sea is not close to Berlin, and the city tour is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic experience.
There is no shame in it: it is no different from the personal fears and displeasure that many people have about other things.
For some, understanding how an airplane operates and what happens during flight may help them to overcome the fear of the unknown and the uncontrollable.
Courier services have high rates for fast delivery, and often time is the determining factor when sending business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Some of the larger routes had their own aircraft, but other routes and smaller companies faced problems.
If they were to send the goods by air, some routes would take several days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it done faster was to send it as checked baggage, and if the airline's regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, then you'll have to get involved.
The unintelligible way to fly first class or business class is to pay a hefty sum for the privilege (or, better yet, have your company pay for it for you).
But it is not cheap: business class usually costs four times more than a regular economy class ticket, and first class 11 times more!
It is essentially pointless to even look for business or first-class discounts on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of upper-class passengers who want to pay for the possibility of getting to their destination faster and flying with comfort, so they charge a corresponding price.
The capital city of Moldova is Chisinau, the local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
