Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A lunatic asylum where young people are supposed to meet today.
A crypt chapel, where now is excavated for the S Bahn tunnel.
Leisure gardeners cultivate the land once owned by farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich brings exciting stories to light.
It is annoying when maps are not up to date.
Everyone knows this, who had to get excited, because the car, Navi instead of a bypass road indicated a green meadow.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria, Atlases, an offer of the geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but topical - but for this very reason very informative.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of the Münchner Merkur have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a patchwork quilt that is not immediately recognizable as such.
More detailed maps, so-called original maps, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
These arose according to the Bavarian Surveying Administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and ordered a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801: It was the current neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive map of Bavaria.
Elector Max IV Joseph pushed the project further, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and, like all the others, can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison between the past and the present is most impressive in the case of the state capital.
The city expanded in all directions and grew together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a district of Munich 21 years after the map was drawn up, i.e. in 1877.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along today ’ s Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the 1705 uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria, only in 1878.
Where today is the Westpark, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-numbered hallway pieces from the so-called "original photograph" from which the property tax was derived.
Small parcels of land are no longer occupied by farmers, but by allotment gardeners of the "Land in Sonne" complex.
A large green area appears north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original position sheet you can read in the area of the today's district Au, Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße people were once locked up with delusions.
There in 1858 / 59 the Munich circle "mental asylum" on the Auer air "was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden, the psychiatrist associated with the death of King Ludwig II, directed the institution.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called lunatics.
He also forbade the staff to use violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who dealt with the institution for an exhibition.
At first there was room for 280 patients, but later it was extended to 500.
At some point, even this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, it has been home to Isar ’ s Amper Hospital in Munich, one of the largest psychiatry centres in Germany.
Young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum on the grounds of the former Au Institute.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with training facilities.
To the west lies the soccer field of TSV München Ost, to the east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - architecturally based on the original building of the mental institution, which had been destroyed in World War II by bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Haupt Platz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, Allied bombs tore many holes in the city centre.
A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business premises and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn main line will take place.
With the slider you can compare the old map of Munich with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to people of color who travel to Missouri because of the state ’ s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to take effect by 28 August 2017, calls on afro, American travelers, visitors and Missouri travelers to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have occurred and been noted across the state recently," the group said.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as state law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed, "the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard."
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, having run out of gasoline during his state tour, and having been taken into custody by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General ’ s Office showing that black car drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be ready whether they bring bail money or let their relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crime reporting program, ranking the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri ’ s law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona following the adoption by states of immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department to other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Electric fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher pasture fence is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.
The CDU parliamentary delegates Peter white and Kordula Kovac provided locally a picture.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the CDU in Fischerbach met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.
Markus Schwendemann initially gave an insight into his farm, in which he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals and accommodates holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, "Black Forest milk" is the unalternative marketing method for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also Chairman of the FARC Fischerbach, he called the electric fence project "elementary important".
I cannot run a profitable business in such steep areas.
The grassland area caused a lot of work, much had to be worked with the motor brush.
"We have to struggle with the conditions and the topography here," emphasised Schwendemann.
In 2003 he took over the parental business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he did not run an organic business.
Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "The municipality has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is pleased with the Leader's support."
Farmers should be supported at a cost of EUR 3 000 to 4 000 per hectare.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could be extended for quite a while.
"The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to move their business forward," the mayor emphasized.
Farmers are often criticised for their subsidies
In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced in by eleven participants through the promotion of electric fences.
The open area amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71,500 euros, half was funded by Leader, and a quarter by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Farmers therefore had to invest 12 610 euros in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible".
Also for Peter white was certain: “Here best food is produced ”.
The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) in Baden-Württemberg enables the state to support pasture fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
A prerequisite is the existence of a funding backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be tractable (slope inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 is currently the application of eight participants with 24 plots, want to build almost 16 Kilometers fence.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing holy anymore?
Now Trump ’ s White House Goes to the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
Americans value them as much as anyone else – hence the carefully orchestrated fall of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad ’ s Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of Trump ’ s key ideologues, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN ’ s Jim Acosta over the president ’ s proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty ’ s imitators would have lynched him if he had done so.
But he attacked its meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller insulted Acosta, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller is right, but as he put it, it is not really history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your oppressed masses who long to breathe freely / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better visible on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US.
This conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict over the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned for her words to be placed at the grassroots after her death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American Republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The connection between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change it back a long time.
The big screamer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but rather is an early neoconservative who brings the American flame into the deranged world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States. "
Limbaugh has come across something quite unusual here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of perception.
The great fanciful act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the weary, miserable, but hopeful men after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their torch is not meant to illuminate the path, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain
UK Athletics Performance Director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad "will make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that United Kingdom track and field needs to learn something from it.
“We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we find out, ” Black said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it ’ s absolutely brilliant. ”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain ’ s speech was incredible, ” says Black.
"A number of athletes, regardless of whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, walked out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and genuine feeling that Eilidh naturally brought was great. "
The Commonwealth ’ s silver medalist, who will compete in her fifth World Cup in the 400 m hurdles, says it ’ s “incredible ” that there are 16 Scots on the British team.
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes at the World Championships to date was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The medium-distance runner Muir leads this way and set five British and two European records last year.
She will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases will also participate in the medals and finals.
“The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it very special for me, ” she added.
"Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on the podium.
Concerning my speech as a captain?
Yes, I think it went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a World Cup home.
So it is really important to count on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there. "
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don ’ t apply for public office if you can ’ t stand voter incitement
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn ’ t take long for newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded at the criticism, for sure.
But he has not silenced his critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb, we are led like sheep to slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.
Hogan ’ s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have voiced their opinions on its official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him about it earlier this week.
The governor ’ s staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a backlash with “So what? ”.
“It ’ s just Facebook, ” many people said.
But it is important.
And it ’ s especially important if it ’ s a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
It has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the governance of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as the primary means of connecting with his voters and playfully debuting his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come on the governor's side - which is a public forum that is called official and of employees who are paid public tax, dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan ’ s spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor ’ s actions, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people wielding the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news program "The Post."
"I also do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then they are rather disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens".
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call an "intercession."
Facebook ’ s “era ” makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than it was in the past to do the same thing by sending employees to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media outlets.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter ’ s feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers took over his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to the newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticising his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he did not silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are at the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former No. 1 European Ronan Rafferty will look forward to home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who left last year in Archerfield until the final round, before losing to Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen how the Renaissance" Club was built, and we see how it reaches its glory with this event, "Rafferty said.
“Players will see this course at its best, it ’ s in great shape.
Jerry did a great job when he decided on this place.
He is an avid supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course. "
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"That really feels special," said the Southport-based player.
"I was not able to defend the Extremadura Open because it was withdrawn the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year are coming back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always cherish. "
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you're playing at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing golf again and I played a solid golf.
I am glad to see how it went. "
The trio on the field includes former Masters ’ winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, parking costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Less lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer as a result of passive smoking.
This is the conclusion of a study conducted by scientists at the University Hospital of Hamburg at Eppendorf (UKE).
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are attributable to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own study on this topic from 1994.
At that time there were still 400 lung cancer deaths because of passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections prove to be very complex
The construction work in Villinger Straße is in full swing and "to some extent in time," says the head of the construction site, Fred Heinze.
In the area of the house connections the situation is more complicated than assumed, since much is hidden in the underground, which is not noted in the plans.
The traffic, which again and again obstructs the construction work, is a big problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of the drivers in front of red lights and barriers is already enormous", reports Heinze.
The road is closed and only the buses are allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt, "says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a stove.
She even seldom uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband ’ s four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was admitted to Indonesia after a controversial referendum in 1969, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public handshake before the occupying forces.
An existing anti-Dutch independence movement quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate. It includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour morning car ride.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated iron roofs, which have been transformed by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their way here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and light skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia ’ s gold country.
The world ’ s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix ’ s Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
Papua also has an estimated USD 78 billion in timber resources.
But these riches are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia ’ s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
An investigation in the New York Times in 2005 reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass-killings in Papua ’ s tribal highlands in the 1970 ’ s became a genocide according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything," says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia, a researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung, canteens sell fried chicken and gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up.
“Migrants have started to sell chickens and vegetables at the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua, ” says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai, a local who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"It has cost the indigenous Papuans - the mama- [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address the inequalities and violations of rights in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored, ” You said.
Indeed, just two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside singing Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offence at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, saying victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita ’ s dance – running in circles and imitating a birdsong – of Papua ’ s Mee Pago ’ s tribe.
Some demonstrators began hurling stones at police and military stations.
When the atmosphere was heated, an order was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document of TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of Kego Koto ’ s Enarotali neighborhood, saw the threat and called for calm, urging the crowd to return home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, has only one name, the TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" her station because she was being attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, spokesman for the Papua Police, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings only came to Jakarta 'filtered' on the following day.
For three weeks Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was establishing an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historic human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90's and early 2000's.
The point is that we are committed to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to be followed, "he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything is regulated by law, ” he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has indicted for "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 lives in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Paniai victims ’ families accepted such claims with grim incredulity.
“I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress, ” says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I am afraid of being arrested by the military, I am afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai ’ s Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to send an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were brought in quickly, according to the TIME.
"I hid in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of concern for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years on the pretext of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is also out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the job of women, who can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities have grown between indigenous Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in large numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region tend to go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or skills to run their own competitive businesses.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on reporting by international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Asia ’ s deputy director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi ’ s campaign ’ s promises to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report on Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shootings.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the group's accusations and told journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and harassed him, "We want freedom," according to a source that also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
“Jokowi is a person with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Paniai, ” says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai, like other Papuans, regard their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, Paniai families carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never receive justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire seizes the 'Torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire in one of the tallest residential towers in the world found its way through Dubai on Friday and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-meter-high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire that will sweep through the skyscraper in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch Towers.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the people shouting.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "said a resident who gave his name to George, Reuters.
Dubai ’ s civil defense agencies said that the fire fighting units extinguished the fire and cooled the building around 4: 00 a.m. local time (12: 00 a.m. GMT).
The government said it was working to provide shelter to those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation carried out by the management of the Torch ’ s building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding used for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said they believed that the system of panels for insulation and cladding at the London Grenfell tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
Recipient of No Davis Cups: Continue with Best of the Five
The President of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) failed the General Assembly with his big Davis Cup-Coup.
At the meeting in Ho ’ Chi ’ Minh City, the for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup ’ s single only on two winning sets was razor-thin not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The often very long, but therefore very much appreciated Five Sentences of the Classics thus remain in the tradition competition.
With 63.54 percent of member countries voting in favor of the reform, ITF President David Haggerty ’ s goal was narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions, "Haggerty said.
They will continue to work on improving the competitions.
After many objections, the proposal to carry out the final in a neutral place had already preceded the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively small details: So the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup in the following year in the first round the host will be right.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places etc. will be eased and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travellers bring prohibited items on the plane, finds out a survey
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who boarded the aircraft while inadvertently carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1% claimed that they had late discovered that they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people – conducted by a Jet ’ s charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. – also found that younger travelers are more likely to ignore the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were Millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were Generation X members.
The most common items that were deliberately smuggled past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted that they had knowingly carried objects with blades through the security check, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought banned drugs into the plane.
The company said it had interviewed travellers across the country to find out how many had inadvertently smuggled through airport security and how many had intentionally done so.
It is no surprise that the people most likely to carry smuggled goods - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA ’ s guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about what liquids they can take with them or how much of them they can take.
It is therefore no surprise that the largest quantity of liquids seized by the TSA is prohibited.
For a while, people thought the TSA could treat books as contraband.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk Doesn ’ t Matter: Tens of Thousand Tesla Customers Cancel Order
Elon Musk likes to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has hitherto concealed the fact that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
Apart from the always triumphant numbers to increases in sales and still more gigantic sales goals Tesla boss Elon Musk betrayed with the announcement of the recent quarterly balance for the first time another, less glanzvolle number: those of the cancellations with the new mass market to model 3.
In recent months, Musk had frequently advertised the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: 63,000 of the total of 518,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will fully refund the deposit of 1000 Euros (1000 US Dollars in the USA and 1000 Pounds in the UK).
Currently, there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument is that the challenge with ambitious growth targets is not demand, but production.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models together - it should be 500,000, in 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, 1800 reservations per day are currently added.
Anyone ordering a "Model 3" today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major interruptions and with maximum capacity utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the enterprise cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA ’ s Chief Pruitt Withdraws to Reduce Emissions because of Obama ’ s Delayed Rules
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era ’ s rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved more responsive to the needs of government environmental agencies than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous post in a federal appeals court.
It is about a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or hampering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma ’ s prosecutor prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a staunch opponent of tighter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose.
The sudden reversal on Wednesday is the latest legal setback to Pruitts ’ s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPO overstepped its authority in trying to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turnaround on ozone standards would simply strengthen CEPOL's willingness to work with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, CEPOL has often failed to meet the implementation deadlines and has been waiting to be sued by activist groups and others and to set the deadline for implementation in an agreement," said Pruitt, who sued CEPOL more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that it gives us seriously. "
Nevertheless, the opinion of CEPOL stated that Pruitt will at some point use his "power of delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on sound policy and the best available information".
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader revision of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued EPA this week, said the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of CEPOL - according to our claims - is a major benefit to the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that is pouring into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil is formed when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course.
“It ’ s worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible move from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe, ” Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity said.
“We must continue to fight the Trump administration ’ s ideological crusade to offend polluters and their special interests. ”
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius' Church: On the occasion of the jubilee of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery in Tumlingen will host a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The preservation of the oldest building in the village has been made a matter of concern to the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem".
In the year 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in a document of Württemberg: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the hill with the parish church of Tumlingen and the bailiwick on it" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Marks silver.
According to the wording of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a manorial court on the Tumlinger Berg to which the church or patronage right belonged and not the other way around.
People also lived there.
As can be seen from the description of the Freudenstadt Upper Office from 1858, the "mountain" was next to the lower village and the upper village, which can still be seen in the townscape of Tumlingen, the third, the lordly settlement centre of the village.
Old maps from around the year 1600 confirm these historical facts.
The patronage right originated from the early medieval proper church right.
A lord, who built a church, furnished it and occupied it with a priest, continued to be the owner of this church and could also inherit it.
Associated with this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two burst at Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616-1648) the windows were broken and the bell ropes stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796 French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the cemetery was also the final resting place of the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.
Only the church steeple was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834 a storm split the steeple and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the still existing tower dwarf remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Pensioners", successor of Dieter Dockhorn, maintain the Hilarius plant.
On Sunday, 16 July, the Friends and Sponsors of Tumlingen invite you to the sixth Serenade at the old cemetery St. Hilariuskapelle.
It will be designed by the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt combo and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Hartmut Romann speaks the closing words.
The programme will start at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 15.30 clock.
At the end of the serenade there is a drink in front of the cemetery.
“Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest ”, the organizers point out the fantastic view.
The Serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to the care of local history, as confirmed by Serenade, the organizer Walter Martini.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines examined
"Boisheim defends itself" sees no legal condition for the building and has therefore turned to the district administrator.
The association "Boisheim resists" has asked District Administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his permission for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at all in the Boisheimer Nette, since at that time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
Such zones should prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.
A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided on a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette by amending the land use plan - but this had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf due to a formal error.
"Due to the lack of planning law prerequisites, the notification of approval is still unlawful and can therefore also be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim resists".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council has again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "At this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is therefore excluded under planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the Viersen district since last week", said a spokesman.
The Circle takes the opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are unlikely to stop the proceedings.
With view of current procedures with the administrative court the circle did not want to express itself on Thursday contentwise to the argumentation of the association “Boisheim resists itself ”.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning the construction of four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
The company, in which the city of Viersen has an indirect stake, had already concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site last year.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11,400 households is to be met - this corresponds to around one fifth of the electricity demand of all households in Viersen.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen ’ s city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach / Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crash: Woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident has occurred on Friday morning against 10 Clock on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhine in the Lahn district).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The road remained closed for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich drove in her car as part of the accompanied driving with her 53-year-old mother as a companion the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and dealers plan "home" shopping weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September, in order to lure the inhabitants to the shopping spree into the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian king, announced, is to sensitize the customers, which offers the own city apart from the usual supermarket “homeland Shoppen ” - weekend for goods ready holds.
A market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies are to present themselves with their apprenticeships.
In addition, the shops of the city center to "midnight shopping" invite.
The action does not only aim at inhabitants of the city and the closer region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags, which refer to the action over weekend, so Christian king.
The city administration and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Thus, the business association and the city are going to another stage of the project "Attractive city center".
This includes new offers such as the first "Active Day" to the fountain festival including open sales Sunday, Talks with all traders and landlords, to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be tapped new or again.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But many locals have also lost sight of the city while shopping.
In the end, everyone should contribute to revitalizing the city center - up to landlords, the companies of the whole city and associations.
King had said in the spring that it was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network, which had partially spread.
Birgit Streich, Head of the CCI Center in Mulhouse informed, that participate in the nationwide third "home shopping" -day, for the first time five Thuringian cities.
Besides Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities", said Streich.
The action under guidance of the IHK and with many partners makes also clear that each citizen with its purchase behavior can influence its direct surrounding field.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others were injured, some of them seriously.
According to the fire department, on Wednesday (local time), another injured man was in critical condition.
A man died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
An initially missing person was later also recovered dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
The authorities suspected the cause of the accident to be work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico for paying the border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president insulted him for publicly denouncing the wall. Reportedly, he said to him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the US, and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US to take over refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous", "bad" and "stupid", and that insisting on the trade brokered by the Obama administration would make it look like a "fool" after he proposed a ban on resettling refugees in the US.
Mr. Trump ended the call after saying to Mr. Turnbull, “This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day. ”
Moore ’ s Ford ’ s Massacre: Activists Restore Racist Lynch as a Call for Justice
A 1948 ’ s Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward Ford ’ s “Bridge of Moore. ”
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block his way.
The mob's leader - a middle-aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n -- -- Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams shattered the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is only a re-enactment.
But when a noose was thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience let out very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really incredible that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to organise the re-enactment.
"It is a stain of dirt on a story, but it is a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the re-enactment serves as a dramatic call to action, and represents an annual reminder to the Monroeño community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want an end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A medical examiner lays a sheet over the body of one of the victims of Moore ’ s Ford “Lynchens ” on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching trial.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivation behind Lynch ’ s actions has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision enabled Georgia ’ s black citizens to vote for the first time in the summer primary.
Around the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcolm stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was escorted to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a mob of lynch surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI "report.
"It is also obvious that there was a frame-up between state and local law enforcement, which not only participated in the murders, but also removed evidence and hid the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, it will happen to you here.'
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene directed the annual re-enactment of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch ’ s murders.
Their presentation is vivid, poignant, and rooted in a kind of profound racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to look, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because then we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - crowded into a room and listened as Greene started a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is the director of Greenes Co.
He has played the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said the role would never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm, who yells at Hester and harasses him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona returns the fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out laughing.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," Greene said, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said 'n --- he' back then."
"Yes," joked one of the other black actors.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And exactly there the energy in space shifts, a feeling of camaraderie replaces the uneasiness.
Everyone is busy getting it right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time Rascona says the N ’ word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's mourning eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred meters behind them, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is divided almost equally between black and white.
A couple have come from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just coming down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia ’ s oppressive humidity for nearly eight hours as Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where Lynch ’ s murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpses.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," murmurs a little boy, as if to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his co-actors and then breaks down weeping in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did it for a reason. "
Later the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chats excitedly about the re-enactment with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words to express the emotion left by the performance.
"It's hard to hear those terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you," she said.
“What this is really doing to me makes me believe that lynching is still going on, ” she added,“ today this is just called police shooting. ”
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and remembering civil rights.
He said that he had already started to plan the performance next year.
"The re-enactment is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like if we don't learn from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it. "
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work, director Frank Castorf again relies on a colorful, frivolous production in front of a gigantic six-story backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows optionally a shabby street corner with remnants of wall and doner kebab stand in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from the GDR or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it, an open Mercedes is parked, in which the Rhine daughters pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels remind us of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through his "Ring" -production.
The three Rhine Daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as in "Rheingold".
Kess seduce them Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drag a corpse into the trunk, and enter the riot squad.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen, surrounded by the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
The scene when he kills Siegfried is brutal.
Later Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humbly bows his hands to Merkel, are celebrated in a stormy manner.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which appears on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat, again in casual leisure clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
In 2013 he had to endure a bleating pipe concert, but five years later there was great cheering, in which the occasional "boo" calls were drowned out.
Festival director Katharina Wagner must have been pleased about this.
"You can tell that the audience has somehow grown together with the" ring "," she said shortly before the dpa performance.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also an understanding of his point of view had grown.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
In their volunteer year, they work in several places.
Where everywhere?
Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I have already worked in the open full day at the school.
What is your experience with this?
Amount: It is a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so you are a late-term volunteer.
How come?
Menge: I graduated from high school.
And then a civil engineering course, shall we say, successfully stopped.
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see, as it is on the ground, in the focus perhaps also, really.
And was it like that?
Amount: I collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social work in the winter semester.
I will study dual, will probably train as a social worker at the Youth Welfare Office in Herne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.
Is it not a little unusual to have several different placements during volunteering?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from nursing home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied for me.
I was also partially in the OGS, in the afternoon care.
For me, this was exactly the right thing that attracted me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Different from studying civil engineering?
Amount: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of your head, who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - one must always deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no reservations?
Amount: I'm not the guy for that.
It is an area that gives you a lot.
Much love, much kindness.
Sometimes there are negative moments, but life is like that.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and its interim dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The job cuts, most of which were announced by Director-General John Fallon at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, come on top of its previous restructuring, in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost.
Pearson announced in May in a third cost-cutting program a plan to cut costs by a further £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the fiscal year remained unchanged, having increased 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoy ’ s attack on Kabul: Nato ’ s soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, say officials.
According to a NATO statement, five soldiers and one interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last act of violence to hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO statement, the explosion occurred on Thursday evening, when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was "attacked" by an "improvised bomb carried by people."
The statement states that all injured are in a stable condition and are treated in the US military hospital at the airport Bagram.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian fatalities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a district of Kabul that was mainly Shia.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s deadliest militant attack since the US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump weighs increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO reverses decision to delay smog, rule after lawsuits
The US Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration, which requires states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
Late on Wednesday, CEPOL announced the decision to move forward with the so-called "ozone regulations 2015" and said it showed the Agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," EPA chief executive Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June CEPOL's intention to delay by one year until October 2018 the ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts must be made in order to meet stricter air quality standards.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, together with the municipality of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has sought to roll back a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that, according to Trump, is supposed to boost economic growth.
The effort, however, has triggered the backlash of democrats and conservation groups worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that inhaling air containing ozone can "reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Municipal council wants common space
In the end, the decision was clear: With two votes against, Fluorn ’ s municipal council, Winzeln, decided to set up a common room in the future senior residence.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing property part is signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take until the area belonging to the congregation is in the possession of the congregation, there is now no longer any obstacle to the planning of the project to be undertaken by a private investor.
There is a debate on this in relation to a common area.
One of the two investors, who are still in the boat, offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council intend to provide such a common room not only as a meeting place for the residents of senior-friendly living, but openly into the municipality.
As an example, the word "knitted café" made the rounds.
The decision, which was decided on in advance last autumn by allocating funds to the current budget, will be made even sweeter by funding opportunities.
The construction is located in the redevelopment area.
According to Tjaden, the establishment of a common room would be eligible with 60 percent of 30 percent.
In order to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw clubs between their legs in this respect, the proposal for a decision states that both saddle - which is based on the surrounding buildings - and pentagon roof - which reduces the eaves height and makes construction more economical - would be possible.
Not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks this addition is unnecessary.
If it helps: it happens unanimously.
The common room is not so easy.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings of her own with which one does not make much progress, but now one leans out of the window at the common room, she says: "I have a hard time with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common room - but absolutely against communal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
That is not so, because with the acquisition of the area one gives no subsidy, but gets a genuine, in the case of doubt marketable counter value, reads the counter speech.
Staiger's request to split up the proposed decision accordingly has three supporters.
Two votes against remain for the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarises as follows: "If we take the decision in this way, we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: cyclist is hurled onto the road

As the police announced, the 82 year old Langenfelder at 12.20 Clock was on his bike on the bike path of the road coming from the direction of Black Way Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the level of Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driving in the same direction, Führerin granted him priority.
When the Langenfeld drove on the road, he obviously did not pay attention to the oncoming traffic.
He collided with a car driven by a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital in a Return Truck.
Bayern Munich has to give up David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let go of the match against Dortmund.
With personnel worries the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first compulsory match of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the defending champion in the Supercup against the cup winner.
The personnel worries at the German football record champions Bayern Munich are before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 Clock / ZDF and Eurosport) with Cup winner Borussia Dortmund ever greater.
In the duel with BVB coach Carlo Seehofer has to do without David Alaba.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
Also missing are Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the past six test games Klitschko blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team ’ s game.
“We know that we ’ re not in the best physical condition, ” he said, adding:“ The most important point is the balance in the team.
In the end it was not good. "
But the 58 year-old believes in a performance increase in the first official compulsory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The crew is ready.
We want to play smart, "said Klose, who expects a" difficult, intense game ".
The duel between the two German soccer heavyweights attracts the fans under their spell.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, announced the German Football League (DFL) on Friday.
Walking from star to star in the Harz
In the resin the country widely first “star path ” is to develop.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many visitors to the resin, it was said.
It combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
The members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association is planning "easily accessible installations at five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.
Questions would include St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the boards is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network, reception, plays a role in the choice of location.
Accessibility was also a criterion.
Later the Starpath will be extended step by step.
"On the Star Path, viewers learn a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the association.
They also learned why stars have different colors, or why one star shines stronger than another, even though it is much further away.
It is also conveyed, in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to be seen.
Since 2014, the association has been operating the highest located observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
According to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Frequently, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda are clearly visible to the naked eye.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the Göttingen Planetarium Association, there has been something similar in the university to the planned star dwarf - the Planetary Trail.
Starting at Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its stelae leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (Gleichen municipality) with the planet Sedna.
The stelae with the individual planets - including Pluto, which has been degraded to a dwarf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth shrinks to a sphere 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimetres.
The total distance of the planetary path is a good four kilometres.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to reach the stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are therefore faster than the light in space.
But the march to the next fixed star would still take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN ’ s Los Angeles offices until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization ’ s Super Featherweight Champion.
After Garcia ’ s victory by unanimous decision on the former Four Division World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both combatants are members of the Top Five Pound-for-Pound list.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck. "
Lomachenko defended his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 19 o ’ clock on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko remarked Egis Klimas ’ s manager that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the “perfect magnitude ”.
"I am a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
“I ’ ve risen for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I ’ m not that big.
I am small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he needs to move to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
This is what the fans demand.
Let us give it to them. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on Pay ’ s per ’ View, part of a strategy that will have Lomachenko struggling with a 135 pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37 “0, 30 knockouts) who is also interested in battling the winner of Jorge Linares ’ s“ lightweight ” Luke Campbell after their title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in the pay per view mode, because all the fans asked about it," said Garcia and later expressed himself openly to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
García said he appreciated Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter", and he might participate in his saturday battle.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the three-way match would look like a "very slow champion from Riverside, sorry Mikey... you wanted to kill off".
Garcia said the focus was to show clout, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
"This is the battle to be fought.
No other fight attracts so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on this, "said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I have been waiting for the top, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight. "
Four Injuries after Tire Bursting
In an accident on the A7, four people were injured on Thursday afternoon, some seriously.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle shortly before the junction in Marktbreit, probably after a puncture.
The car hurled to the right into the embankment, where it rolled over and then remained lying on the roof in the grass.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial medical treatment of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour, after which the traffic on the left lane could be directed past the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Triple chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2-2 at the season opener against Braunschweig, that the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue brings points.
With the first game of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result also, if there had not been the two goals against Braunschweig in the 2: 2.
"Those were two goals too many, and we have to watch even better in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defender.
In the Ore Mountains, the three-dimensional chain is also to be further optimised.
And a goal after a free kick the Fortunen don't want to catch.
"For the future it will be like this, that nobody will line up next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that even after his experience in the preparation, his team can cope better with the three-way chain than with the four-way chain.
"I do not yet know how we will act in Aue", says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have players who can build up well in the three-way chain on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann", said Hoffmann.
"A prerequisite is, however, that we harmonize even better and that we do not afford so many playback errors in the construction."
Of course Hoffmann also travels to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can say after a draw of a failed start, does not know.
The performance could well be okay, "said Hoffmann.
"But if we can stand there on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup, we will surely be able to speak of a proper season opener."
His coach did not want to know about that.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight match days", said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be stopped prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can virtually start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, as they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a favorite of promotion in their bones.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they are at the moment", says Fortuna's central defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland will be the easy favourite on Sunday in the (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
“It ’ s nonsense that we sweep them away just because we want to finish in the top six, ” says Funkel, whose record is quite positive with only one loss to Aue out of nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat right from the start," explains Fortuna's head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant".
And so Funkel does not want to see his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum seeker evaluation tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80% of those tested are older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started conducting the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they are to make the age assessment more accurate after the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent out 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age".
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see much difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are pretty constant," he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person is judged to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his or her age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person examined is 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it stated that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that he would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age evaluation, where x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI are taken, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
One skeptic is the Karolinska institute ’ s endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing people ’ s biological maturity to see if they passed through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don ’ t think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can, "he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is just under 18, in this case about 10 percent. "
Voll im Plan
Work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance to Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, site manager at the department of road engineering and transport at the regional council of Freiburg.
Work on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of renovation started simultaneously in April.
Construction is scheduled to be completed in October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, crosses the Trombach.
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete, which is clad with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it is getting old.
To ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach.
They are made of red coloured sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve metres long, or 10.60 metres long.
The bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a edge fastening, which is also used as an operating path.
A 2.20 metre wide bridge cap is to be installed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
This is where the pedestrian path should run.
The special thing about this is that it concerns finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of pipes through the building in Lauterbach required a special sensitivity.
This is where a fibre-optic cable runs, to which many companies are connected.
Prior to the work, the residents were informed about the project by flyers.
In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the Sammelweiher towards Schramberg, the traffic is regulated by a single lane traffic light.
For the construction of the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully closed.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colourful protest at German potato salad
It is not often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel district parliament (CDU, SPD, Green Party, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that peacefully flies the flag on this day, because the AfD invites in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the loud poster "big campaign start".
And brings well-known names to the start - like Alice Weidel, which forms the top duo with Alexander Gauland for the federal election on 24 September, and the deputy national chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those on the ground hours before the event do not want to listen to the AfD ’ s people, but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful".
Originally, the city was planned picnic under the motto "All at one table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus right before the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colourful picture that presents itself.
And what Christa Karoli, chair of the One World Forum and one of the leading organisers, is really pleased about: "Great how many people have gathered here".
There is music and plenty of food, including a "primeval German potato salad that the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought him.
The police have summoned many officers to Gerolstein, they show presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the event locations.
How did AfD come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reported, He has tried to organize such an event and won the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but there got a refusal, because because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes not enough parking spaces are available.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on the roundabout, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing is that it remains peaceful."
And it does: Against 20 Clock provides on the Rondellvorplatz a band for entertainment, in the Stadthalle diverse speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD, Chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 people in the hall waiting for Alice Weidel, the leading candidate for the Bundestag election, and Beatrix von Storch, the deputy chairman of the Federal Republic, to deliver their speeches.
The police presence remains unchanged, but until now the officers had a quiet evening.
The AfD ’ s event lasts a little more than an hour. The guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but there, too, it ’ s time to clean up shortly after 9pm.
The police can move away - no special occurrences.
Trombone meets trumpet
A reunion with the trombonist Frederic Belli from Wolfach will take place tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the Klosterkirche in Haslach.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and prizewinners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo trombonist with the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both are united by the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to blend the boundaries of the various genres.
Thus Johann Sebastian Bach sounds with them like in a new garb, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the jazz echo award winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free playing mix to a fascinating synthesis of the arts.
This centrepiece of the programme was not premiered until this spring with enormous success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: the Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything, "Kristen Stewart says openly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'."
Probably the most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was that to her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, which finally diverged bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I met.
Or do you think I played it? "
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and sincerely believed in dualism.
It has never confused or obstructed me.
I just never liked not to be taken seriously. "
In particular she suffered from it loud "Bang Showbiz", however, in the school time, when she rather dressed like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, frightened and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself: 'Girl, be proud of you!' "
Especially to the public she does not like to explain her love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And some may call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself to the whole public. "
West Virginia Governor Announces Change of Party
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me, ” said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with much prayer and reflection... today I will tell you, as a resident of West Virginia, that I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out into jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration with the Republicans," Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it ’ s time to play a different game. ”
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night, in which it said, "Governor Justice's change of party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
“With only 15 governorates and the control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice ’ s announcement is only the latest rejection of a party that is top-to-bottom with no leadership and is unable to find a positive, unifying message, ” RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel told CBS News in a statement.
Coe praises “honest ” Russian apology for doping in scandal
The global athletics leader, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the moment for the country to be re-admitted to the sport.
Russia ’ s athletics chief, Dmitry Shylakhtin, said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics that his country ’ s banishment from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he felt sorry for "all athletes who were snatched gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which was imposed in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation, ” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized in itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reformed."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the time to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We must do all we can in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Championships in Athletics, which start in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF ’ s task force, Rune Andersen, said Monday that Russia had yet to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug testing is still inadequate and banned coaches are still working freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation at the IAAF Council.
Funeral for soldiers who fell in Mali
At a funeral service in Fritzlar in northern Hesse, around 1000 people remembered the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the still unsolved cause of the crash.
However, she described the two dead pilots as "experts in their profession".
"We bow our heads to this supreme sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she declared.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from northern Hesse were killed on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to Fritzlar Cathedral St. Peter on Thursday accompanied by a wake of the Bundeswehr.
At noon, only the relatives at the church took leave.
Afterwards the funeral began with family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politicians.
Among them were the Prime Minister of Hesse Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Guests laid down roses, and the relatives stood arm in arm by the coffins.
Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen in front of the church.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced in action.
The Chief of Staff helped set up the flight operations of the combat helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also explained: "If this crew could not prevent the crash, then nobody would have been able to".
Minister von der Leyen had no doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the mission was dangerous.
But it was also of great importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral service the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not give any information.
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife
The husband of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the royal family on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for them.
The statement went on to say that the Queen agreed with her husband ’ s decision.
It is still unclear where Prince Henrik will be buried.
But he had no intention of being buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After the accession of his wife Margrethe to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired, leaving the title of "Prince Consort".
As Henrik did not get the title and the function he wanted in Denmark, he did not regard himself as equal to his wife - not even after his death, said Lene Balleby, the head speaker of the Danish royal family.
Where the final resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for in the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, met Margrethe in London in 1965.
At the Thames he worked in the French embassy.
While his later wife always received the sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik had a hard time with the Danes during his nearly 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitted socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked instead of Virginia, and which had the reputation in this country to be the mark of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
These were two mistakes! "
Prime Minister Weil wants swift new elections
CDU and FDP face possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the state parliament following the loss of the red-and-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because, on Friday, we voted in favour of the dissolution of Parliament.
Prior to this, the surprising withdrawal of a Green MP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-and-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one votes, with a majority in parliament, to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The previous Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the election 2018 in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she declared on Friday in Hanover.
CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to its parliamentary group to admit it.
Thus CDU and FDP would have altogether 69 seats in the Lower Saxony federal state parliament, SPD and Greens 68 seats.
Until now, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag is elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-and-green state government now had to decide whether it could continue to govern without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it indispensable that the Landtag resolves to dissolve itself as soon as possible.
The CDU parliamentary group is expected to decide on Tuesday on its next steps.
The Land constitution also provides for the possibility that the Land parliament withdraws the trust of the Prime Minister and elects a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined in a legally correct way ", Thümler said.
"All questions will be discussed calmly if they are properly examined by the law."
Thümler called Twestens step "something curious".
The politician herself stressed: “I am not a traitor.
I feel very good. "
She described herself as a follower of black and green.
The Greens called on the renegade MP to return her mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return with immediate effect the mandate she received on the Green Land list," said the country presidents Meta Janssen and Stefan Körner.
Group leader Anja Piel said: "We deeply regret Elke Twesten's decision".
She has deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters, but also a betrayal of the Red Green," wrote the head of the Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag elected quickly.
The withdrawal of Twestens costs Red Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician, "in her hurt vanity and frustration, puts her personal interests before the welfare of the country," criticized SPD secretary general Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is participating in this dirty intrigue and is trying to make political capital from it".
Lower Saxony's CDU president Björn Thümler will recommend his MPs, Elke Twesten to join the CDU.
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the results of the 2013 state election with his personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest party before the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a razor-thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Agriculture Minister in an Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoned eggs, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) answers questions in an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mr. Schmidt, How can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the eggs concerned.
Egg should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the educator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food control is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house was immediately activated and has been in close contact with the authorities of the Länder ever since it became known that Germany was affected.
All information and the risk assessment are available to consumers.
Retail, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and safe.
If the maximum residue content of eggs is exceeded by 0.005mg / kg, they are not marketable.
Uncontaminated eggs can, however, be sold and consumed.
This time the plants are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
As far as we know, production is not directly responsible.
On the contrary, they are likely to suffer economic damage as a result of alleged illegal practices by service providers.
As always, there are too few inspectors in an emergency.
Is there only a lack of staff or of coherent competence?
It was, after all, the official controls that exposed the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be completely ruled out.
It is precisely for this reason that consistent investigation of such events and surrender to the public prosecutor's offices in cases where crimes may be committed are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide full clarification.
Is it really necessary to be regularly alarmed by food scandals?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are right to be outraged.
The adulterated product has put manufacturers, distributors and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
It must be clear in principle that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-supplying animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and at full speed at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the facts quickly and thoroughly.
How football ’ s financial rules affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European football clubs will not disturb Neymar ’ s world record, the transfer from Barcelona in Spain to Paris in France ’ s Saint Germain.
Any consequences will yet come for Paris Saint Germain from UEFA, as the governing organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions ’ League tournament.
The financial fair “play ” rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid €222 million ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar ’ s move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose by signing Neymar and taking him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but have to counteract with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break the break even-point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA ’ s president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs ’ debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - was to become a tougher business.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can incur losses of €30 million.
And, though Platini fell from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to deterring excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out-and-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer fee of 44.4 million euros for the next five years can be shown in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (82 million dollars at the time), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team's members for the Champions' League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial regulators by inflating their revenues through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this as a legitimate income.
This is what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of PSG ’ s payments to Neymar could come from payments made by the 2022 World Cup Organizing Committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar denied in 2022 that Neymar will become ambassador, and that such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA ’ s regulators to figure out.
The existing sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said the people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not empowered to discuss the PSG's situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon to sponsorship, deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association assumes that the turnover will rise after the signing by at least 30 per cent.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," said La Liga president Javier Tebas to Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal ’ s manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sporting tycoon, shares La Liga ’ s reservations against a state that finances a club.
“It ’ s the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the past 15 years, ” Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country. "
Swiss is looking for a new shoggi supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey Bord has produced chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to come to a possible end: the airline is putting the contract out to tender.
At the request of the news agency sda, the Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a report by the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products are inspected every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey", said the spokeswoman.
Approximately 17 million small, red-and-white-wrapped 14 gram chocolate bars are distributed to passengers by the flight attendants each year before landing.
Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: For a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
Swiss will not reveal how many applicants there are for the new call.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate bars on board its flights since 2006.
Before Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate "tablets" in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers will be pampered with delicacies from the Sprüngli confectionery, in Business Class passengers will snack on Lindt ’ s Schoggi and in Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi also distributes Chocolat Frey on short-haul flights, in both business and economy class.
Athletics - Discus Gold medalist Robert Harting reaches World Championship Final
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic gold medalist of 2016, had failed in the national World Championships and could only watch the Discus Competition from the stands.
Also with the first attempt, Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters away, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia enters the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 ’ s, for the 90 ’ s of the 90 ’ s Grunge ’ era (when masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch of “The State ” for MTV), and for themselves – that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to do greater things.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our facebook enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables, spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By focusing on the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they nevertheless managed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more by the watering can principle, including a riff on the Stalker ’ s films of the 90 ’ s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character rummages through an Apple ’ s powerbook, some inline skates, and “a bunch of other things from 1991 ”.
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there ’ s another crazy, malicious plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It ’ s a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon ’ s lower lip beard from “Singles ”, whose former“ Big ’ ’ Man ’ ’ on ’ ’ Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I take to be his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose final scene will show the gang attending the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East versus West wrestling.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy, directed by Rhys Thomas, claims to be a TV series found: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism, and Leninism.
The leading roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon.
It is a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to look at (the police spend their time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of 'find the voice out'.
But Comrade Detective is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - including a murderer wearing a Reagan "mask" - that it often plays like one.
Six long episodes are dragging on, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited to a shorter length, could provide his agitprop, "satire," as Gregor and Iosef visit the American Embassy again and again, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message to the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make anything a fodder for a feast.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we are even doing it with our own recent history and theirs.
Drug strike Mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning in the Black Forest region of Baar, in Rottweil, Constance, Esslingen and Stuttgart numerous objects were searched, as the public prosecutor's office in Constance announced on Friday.
In the process, 15 accused persons aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and have already issued warrants for their arrest.
The officials also seized large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two Italian suspects.
The two are therefore presumably extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder and robbery and blackmail.
The Constance Public Prosecutor ’ s Office has been investigating organised drug trafficking in southern Germany since summer 2016.
There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo, and the investigators from the Criminal Investigation Department in Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officers from Palermo.
The investigations mainly targeted Italian nationals closely linked to the Italian Mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, could also be attributed to the gang.
Weise bemoans large gaps in the foreigner registry
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreigner registry in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to sometimes serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank rücken Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "partly serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned Weise in an analysis which is available in the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
The register reportedly covers 10 million people of foreign nationality, including around 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
According to this, the data is administered by about 600 immigration authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who have long since ceased to be alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register."
According to the report, "incorrect data input can significantly slow down return processes."
The statistics on people who are obliged to leave the country also cover EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
However, such incorrect assignments led to "a distorted debate about the treatment of persons obliged to leave the country", according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the German government seems to have begun sending refugee families with children under 16 years of age back to Italy once they have entered the country.
This is the result of an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung.
The paper states that the BAMF has resumed such proceedings "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and very young children - in Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, according to the newspaper with reference to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, EU refugees are responsible for the state they first reach.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
As justification, the Office wrote: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with underage children in Italy has significantly increased".
Italy had given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, Speaker for Home Affairs of the Left Group in the Bundestag, criticised this decision: "Families with children are threatened with inhumane reception conditions and endangering the welfare of the child because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system."
Second best result achieved
The blood donation service already provided a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday.
First of all Jürgen Greule, who shared 50 litres of blood with his meanwhile 100 donations.
Traditionally, the congregation appreciates in the meeting of the municipal council the multiple readiness to donate blood.
“It is ingenious how our body is arranged for it and we pay respect to the donors, who make their blood available for strangers, still more altruistically ”, underlined mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single donation of blood helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, head of the German Red Cross (DRK) preparedness department, as canned food is broken down into its constituent parts.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the activities that will be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
“This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors, ” said the DRC ’ s district standby officer.
The move to the theatre a few years ago had obviously led to higher numbers of participants.
Prior to this, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were honoured for 50 blood donations each.
Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger account for half as many, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter each gave 500 millilitres of their lifeblood ten times.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it maintained interest rates on family incomes amid mounting pressure.
Policymakers on the Bank ’ s Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month, as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
But it signaled that interest-rate hikes would be needed in the coming years to rein in Brexit fueled inflation, and it said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide an extra GBP 15 billion under this scheme - GBP 115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real household incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
At interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and "a little more" than markets expect.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
The Bank ’ s downward revised growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecasts in May.
It maintained its growth forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for an increase in interest rates and GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to reach 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the Bank towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report showed little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small wage increases, as the tightening gets worse before it improves.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the drop in income in the coming years, but added that wages will "significantly" recover at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy will also be strengthened by rising demand for British goods, owing to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25% last August, following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years before this will fully reach prices and the economy.
Before the Bank ’ s last ruling on interest rates, the call for an interest-rate hike had grown, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said it was expected to do so and that it would pick up again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overrun in relation to its 2% target was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders clamor for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who are phasing out existing deals and taking out new mortgages, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular. "
NHS (The National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV-related drug to 10,000 people
Patients will have access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment as of September, following a battle before the High Court against NHS funding.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now being provided by the health service through a first three years ’ study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the process after the Court of Appeal last year upheld a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP, despite claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed by NHS England ’ s Simon Stevens as an “important new intervention, ” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called it a“ defining moment. ”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and more will follow in October, before being rolled out across the UK in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a sequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person ’ s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken two hours before sexual intercourse every day or so.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree with the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the delivery of the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The aim of the study is to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on a large-scale, targeted use, uptake and implementation.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing mankind. "
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people at high HIV risk will have access to this NHS "funded trial" in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, Chairman of the Board of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now must be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and for no one at risk of HIV to be left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are well on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV. "
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop transmission of this life-changing infection.
This experiment brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people infected with HIV and to help bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society '.
Live the big life: mezzanine and clever designers ’ tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne didn't pack and sell her bags.
“Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room, ” says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day. "
Since the first visit, the apartment of 1,000 square feet has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement, ” she says.
To this end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi ’ s Duck & Shed architecture and design studio in Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot ceilings to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steelworks is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down.
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform, but of putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms on top of each other in full height - with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window by Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
Through the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close off the kitchen when not in use.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A little engineering skill went in there," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF "door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property will be valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the size of the floor."
Here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home, ” says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "
It shows that an apartment can transform into something quite amazing through good design and increased square meters of something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave.
Brothers Fight for a 500 Million U.S. Dollars Real Estate Empire
Four decades after her Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers are in conflict over one of Victoria ’ s largest real-estate empires, worth more than $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football ’ s Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to see how their property and business assets should be divided.
Paul has wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a heated argument over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a store on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco family founded Jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.
This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis ’ portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
Following an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one-third.
One court record states that this means that Colin has property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has been a problem for Paul.
"Colin's proposed allocations left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed conciliations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages containing affiliates, e-mails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy Collingwood ’ s property, where Colin opened the family ’ s first denim store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was a young child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis ’ s corporate group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million upon leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, "have become embittered about the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin has held back a great deal, though he was a former AFL executive board member and, following a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star ’ s best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their attorneys.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to drag our surname through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother ’ s demands.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current quarrel," he said, adding that he was "still hoping for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the president ’ s media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met senior employees on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that would fall into the president ’ s hands.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. "
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump ’ s relationship with television stretches back decades – and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
“When candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair reporting from jobs that needed convincing, ” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a steady flow of praise. ”
Okay.
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been “under control ” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don ’ t – that without their intervention, Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel.
We will probably never learn about the tweets that Trump has not sent.
If his associates have managed to keep him out of trouble several times, then their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from provoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing parties, people keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may advance their views of the world.
Politico - busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of the advisers to supply dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he ’ s fixated on finding out where they come from.
This is what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet ’ s provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a pile of leaks ” in the White House.
Though Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he offered no concrete evidence, or that he made false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began questioning employees about Walsh. ”
Goldmakers added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary-General Rob Porter "have been trying to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still seeking influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the assistance of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending out (virtual) postcards this summer to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are naturally not known, references from the population are hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday on the follow-up to the EU Most Wanted winter Advent calendar.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, it was said on the part of Europol.
They have put together 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
The www.eumostwanted website has been in existence since 2016 and has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the Online Found could be arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to information after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'Millionaire's' series
Some of the West Midlands ’ wealthiest homeowners are once again at loggerheads with some determined travellers who have negotiated a community-drawn trench to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the “Millionaire ’ s Row ”.
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after being thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch dug by the Council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Angry inhabitants have harassed the council of Solihull, which said that it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there Monday evening after being sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action through shame, as it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today. "
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by giving long instruction to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council can't even stop it. "
A resident who did not want to be named said, "It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area. "
A Council Spokesperson from Solihull said: "We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the countryside on the other side of Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls Police. We are taking the necessary legal steps to get them moving as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to give an idea of the situation in which the Court will have to consider when we bring our case. "
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof is now the Waldhotel Luise.
The house on the outskirts of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to reopen on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time, as well as revenue from the tourist tax.
In the fall of 2014, with the dramatic increase in the number of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a collective accommodation, which caused controversy.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was at that time not undisputed in the municipal council.
But it was above all the mayor of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, who defended the hotel location and even then spoke of serious prospects for the hotel.
He should be proved right.
The Luisenhotels Group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it once again a house of the Three Stars Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four buildings in Freudenstadt.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction waste containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the building, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
Much remains to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "close to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a jewel out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included.
They did not want to position themselves on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a higher level of downtown, Scherer stresses.
Scherer goes on to explain that the Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to set itself up broadly.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel.
He has already held talks with Mayor Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The concepts of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line."
When asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to commit himself exactly.
Just under a million euros, he calculates.
The exterior facilities are also being upgraded, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard there will be a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia: US Special Counsel Appoints Grand Jury
In the Russian affair involving US President Donald Trump, special counsel Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called grand jury, according to a report.
The panel had begun its work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The paper saw the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that the panel had already issued its first subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller examines whether Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow colluded.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republican during the election campaign.
Mueller also reportedly studied more and more of Trump ’ s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special prosecutor had personally brought Trump to the fore and investigated the accusation that the president had possibly obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Juries is to examine available evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether charges should be brought.
Therefore, Grand Juries are also called Trial Chambers.
They are usually used when there are major and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The panel may also be called upon by the prosecution to summon persons under oath for questioning.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
Trump Jr. was joined by Trump ’ s counselor and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his campaign manager, Paul Manafort.
Legal experts said Thursday night on US television that the inauguration showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it did not necessarily have to mean that the Grand Jury would be involved at the end in order to decide on the bringing of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel was the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia Thursday night to portray the Russia-led affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
“Russia ’ s founding history is a total invention, ” Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a chance to “feel good because they have nothing else to talk about. ”
His special adviser Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he knew nothing about the appointment of a Grand Jury.
But he emphasized that this work is also usually done in secret.
The White House supported any measures that 'fairly' accelerated the work of the Special Investigator.
Former FBI executive James Comey has said three times that the president is not being investigated.
The statement went on to say that there was no reason to believe that this had changed.
But Mueller was only deployed after Trump fired Comey.
This expulsion had led to accusations against Trump that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey testified in June before a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media accounts, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his staff.
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller.
Unlike an independent Congressional special counsel, such as Watergate ’ s case over Richard Nixon, who later resigned, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the president ’ s insistence.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the special counsel could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg floating in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg the size of Berlin has separated from the shelf ice.
This was reported by Bremerhaven ’ s Alfredo Wegener, Institute for Polar and Marine Research, on Wednesday.
The giant, weighing over a trillion tons and measuring 5,800 square kilometres, is now drifting northwards and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants recorded by researchers over the past three decades.
It does not pose a danger to people.
According to researchers, the extent to which climate change played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear.
Altogether, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen ’ C ’ Ice Shelf.
Ice shelves swim on the sea and are fed by large glaciers.
It grows further and further into the sea and breaks up regularly.
It is located south of South America at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this shelf ice, the balance between growing and breaking was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shelf ice has fallen apart there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is reason to believe that the Larsen ’ C ’ shelf ice is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is now.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and could disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a crux.
Melting of ice shelves and icebergs does not raise the sea level, as they float on the water and displace as much water as is produced after melting.
However, the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can drain away much faster than before.
This could possibly raise the sea level, but only to a limited extent, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI, the Larsen ’ C ’ shelf ice is the fourth largest shelf ice in Antarctica, measuring almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the leading edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Swansea University's Martin O'Leary.
"This is the widest retreat since the beginning of the records," he confirmed.
According to his colleague, Adrian Luckman, there is a dispute among scientists as to whether the Larsen “C ” ice shelf will grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse, adding:“ Our models say it will be less stable. ”
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice sheet on the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The temperature rise contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by around three degrees in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature rises the fastest.
CDU wants house tariff for staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is calling for people to leave the employers ’ association in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break the Kreistag waved 41 new places through in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have completed their first day at work.
The apprenticeships at the Kreis are obviously very popular.
Around 620 applications were received for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless the circle lacks further personnel, in order to be able to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
At present there are still 50 vacancies in the district of Mettmann.
Among others, doctors and engineers as well as members of the general administration are sought.
The CDU would like to seize the initiative in the Kreistag now together with the FDP and the UWG and face the lack of specialists in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration should "develop a concept for personnel recruitment and development".
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented way, it is said.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for career changers and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do it with personnel, problems, which one did not know in former times like that.
Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a veritable 'competition of public employers'.
In addition, there are a large number of employees who are leaving the service due to illness or old age.
So it is high time to act, so that more posts do not remain unfilled.
But Klaus is Dieter Völker, Group Leader of the CDU, goes with his party even beyond the joint motion.
He caused a big surprise recently in the county council when he publicly questioned the staffing ceiling and stunned the other parties.
Peoples want to see all possibilities for leaving the municipal employers' association reviewed.
"If we do not reach a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration and the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated cities - should strive for a house tariff", said Völker.
Thus the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than it plans the tariff regulation for the public service actually.
Salaries are currently strictly prescribed, and increases or more money can only be obtained if one moves to a higher level based on years of work.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in the past years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be established in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.
Not least by the rising number of asylum-seekers district administrator Thomas Hendele and district director Martin judge have a problem: They have too few personnel.
Italy tightened the tone to NGO inhabitants in lifeboats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue if they do not abide by new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat belonging to the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rettet' (Youth Saved) because its crew had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to respond to detailed allegations made by the Italian public prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, saving human life is and will remain our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment, ” the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the allegations that are currently being made after we have gathered all the information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that its crew will take on inflatables, which will be delivered directly to them by traffickers, and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the vessels can be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Prosecutor ’ s file, the contents of which were published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not entail "significant changes or obstructions" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate ’ s organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy following the rescue operations has fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and work with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
He announced plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives, and with Chad, Niger, and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Ascents and trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the northern Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sightseeing.
Three friendly guides were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra.
The first tour led along the vineyards to the Chapel of St Michael above Deidesheim in hot summer temperatures.
Viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatinate forest and the upstream plains.
In between there were always longer climbs, for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim for the saline and the sausage fair.
Again, vantage point after vantage point, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate ascents.
On the last two days we had to climb a lot again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled healing brine in the open-air inhalatory.
Also Neustadt was controlled.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres in altitude, the group had come to know the Palatinate Forest from its best side - both sporting and cultural.
Console instead of turf - Bundesliga gears up for eSport
Will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of fighting sweaty in wind and weather over the pitch?
The fact is that E ’ sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business – including big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees.
The first Bundesliga clubs to become increasingly involved in this area have also recognised this.
VfL Wolfsburg made the start in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an E ’ Sport ’ division in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB", says executive committee yokes Röttgermann.
He is sure, "that on this train still some clubs will climb".
On the coming weekend, the football World Federation FIFA organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the E Sport.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds in particular, so that the young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52 year old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent athletes under contract, you could be online much more often present on these markets than just once a year to send the Bundesliga team to Asia.
What is it all about?
In the e-sport, computer games such as "League of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the soccer simulation FIFA are fought on a competitive level.
Long since, as in normal sports, leagues have been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, eSport is already part of the official program.
But is it really a sport?
For many, the performance certainly takes some getting used to.
Ingo Froböse also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, E ’ sport is a sport because it is competitive and has many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classic sports – for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
There is also a need for cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue".
Controls are difficult to implement in online games, and the scene lacks the structures of classic sports.
The scientist positively emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport.
The players are international, which is like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.
A study of the management consultation Deloitte and the Federal association of interactive maintenance software (BIU) predicts the E-sport a rapid growth.
In 2016, this means that 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and major tournaments.
In three years, the turnover is expected to be 130 million.
Against the scarcely 2.4 billion euro of the soccer Bundesliga that is few.
However, according to the Deloitte consultants, the e-sport is "no longer far removed from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey."
Internationally, many countries have moved on.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where former basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood Actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSport betting company Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports was introduced as a subject, says Froböse.
According to Dutt, in the Netherlands and France, football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In a European comparison, Germany is lagging behind", explained VfB's CEO Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia and glorifying the old days is no longer enough.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitalised world," says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only in football everything stays as it always was."
Toxic Eggs ade - Egg Alternative for Cooking and Baking
In the meantime almost all federal states are affected by the scandal of poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and removed all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown not to contain fipronil should be put on the shelves.
Michelle Carter sentenced for the lyrics that urge Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended.
Carter was convicted in June of the careless killing of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, folded hands, and eyes down as she was convicted.
"Their actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended his life to make her own better.
She has taken no responsibility, "she said.
"She has shown no remorse".
But Carter ’ s lawyer said it was a “terrible circumstance that she completely regrets. ”
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he had not found that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, had a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy ’ s mother, Lynn Roy, stating that “there is not a day on which I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pain we will carry with us for eternity, "it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, stated that she was "haunted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having the one person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that it had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump from a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention from Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case through some press.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not imprisonment."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new Mini Lahm of FC Bayern
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to line up as captain at the Audi Cup.
The Bayern trusts the Confed Cup-Winners to a great season - Extra motivation is not bad there.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, Joshua Kimmich saw that immediately, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But as there was of course no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Neuer to be seen far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, he put the bandage assigned to him on his arm.
"The coach has not announced it", told the Confed in the Cup after the winner, after his first appearance as captain Bayern.
Well, the debut could have run better than the 0-2 against the SSC Napoli.
But Kimmich was able to interpret the coach ’ s sign as well.
It was not the eight-year-older Arturo Vidal who had been chosen as the game leader in the C-team consisting of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come from holiday.
You distribute sweets preferably to those whom you trust a lot and who you want to keep happy.
So who was chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm, can only use a little extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what a player wants: to take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old dashed over the field as a mini lame.
Right back, that's his position, the white band on his arm did the rest.
And in general Kimmich appeared in this starting formation like the one who can take the helm best.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unregulated troupe.
He had the whole view, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal with it, his lack of fitness to play over (worked hardly); Renato Sanches with it, on hell come out to pick up on the performances of Asia (worked also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with it, in their first appearance in the Bavarian jersey not to attract negative attention.
After all, that worked out quite well.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereign.
The well-known occupied Napoli "storm" was often difficult, moreover, Süle tried a few times successfully in the game structure.
His colleague, Mr Rudy, admitted that the result was' not as we had hoped '.
But he also showed a good performance at his debut.
Shifting the game, changing the tempo: "For this style I was also brought".
How unusual this Bavaria is still world for the new entrants, one saw after the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but certainly six or seven.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few sharp statements in the back of his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
In Bavaria you simply have to win every game ".
After all, he no longer has to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ’ s Ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB
Shortly before the match, Austria ’ s most famous football player reported via Twitter and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian Legionary is so to say club colleague of ÖFB, Captain Schnaderbeck and feverishly with our ladies with.
The Tweet of the Austrian Soccer Player of the Year and Champions' League 'Winner should be a special injection of motivation.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bavarian Dusel.
Company satisfied with Rhineland Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissings pace
It often turned out irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Economics Minister Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the former minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has blocked all of them."
Natus sees the biggest U-turn in infrastructure policy: Closing the gap on the Autobahn 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s priority list.
The Ministry hopes for a planning approval procedure before the end of this year, and the building law is to be in place by 2021.
The Trier West Bypass, which is the priority requirement of the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan, also plays a role in the country ’ s plans.
The goal is to put the line into operation in December 2020, says Ministry Spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
As suggested by Wissing, the Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) is striving for a Rhineland Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine export that has been sagging for ten years.
Besides Wissing has an open ear for humans, who want to create their own company, praise the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master craftsman bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euro for the master craftsman examination and 2500 euro is intended, if graduates become independent within ten years after the master craftsman training.
The homework, however, remains long list for the country.
With the planned road construction facts are to be created fast, at the same time it lacks the country at the necessary personnel, say Jan Glockauer, managing director of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers Wissing intends to hire at Landesbetrieb Mobilität, only 29 positions have been filled so far.
The CCI calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, the CDU ’ s vice-president, points to the Court of Auditors ’ calculations that the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of state roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus is also expecting a concept from the country as to how it intends to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The previous broadband expansion in the country was also sobering.
In a 2016 Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) survey, regional companies rated the grid supply only 3.4.
They complained about stalled Internet connections and disconnections.
In contrast, Eveline Lemke, former Minister of Economic Affairs, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind energy company Pro Wind.
The Green Party left Lemke in April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she left the field after four months due to disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - Automakers face a backlash
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW executive chairman said the company believed that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions" and referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers of installing equipment to neutralise exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of pampering powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which use so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the rules when a car has been tested, but drive back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been accused, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in engine development at Audi in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could severely burden Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that the Isar also participate in visitors, tomorrow a raft goes through Munich, which has a special message.
If you want to go to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common raft, with Isar ’ s tourists.
But the construction department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large information display.
It shows a mountain of garbage.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar ’ s visitors.
With the motto "True love is"... should sharpen the understanding for the Isar as a wild river worth protecting.
Already last summer the raft crossed the Isar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's bulbous noses and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon artists, the bulbous noses of his characters are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentinean still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laughter, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants.
In the first years as an artist he worked among others as a draughtsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he achieved his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, rounded Mordillo figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
According to his own statements, he still sits at the drawing table in the early morning, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, shirts, cuddly toys and watches, his funny figures continue to be widely used all over the world.
For six years he has also been working on an animated film and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a millipede as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which will be screened in 2019.
“I don ’ t know exactly what they ’ re going to say, it ’ s strange for me, ” Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That is why he rather relies on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to the drought-like conditions and the disease transmitting insects, which is a great headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "Lavender in Provence is at risk because it has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "
And the stakes are high.
Lavender oil is not only attractive for holidaymakers, it is also in great demand for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "
The solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The small town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1,200 year anniversary this year.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Traders, guilds, traders, vagrants or a Lansquenet camp are to be experienced on these days in the city centre.
The assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans to cover the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials, and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on government payrolls or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and while the corpses are piling up all over the country, more and more journalists are taking part: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is its editor and inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the façade of the Riodoce. Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special prosecutor ’ s office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings.
As with most of the thousands of murders that occur every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are inconsolable and the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know the why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot at 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated as "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
However, on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields, with rival factions fighting to fill the vacuum.
It does not matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day, or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of 'calm' when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was shattered by the fact that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman ’ s sons.
This publication may have angered the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined forces with five colleagues to form Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars in stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the drug-related problem," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for its courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish tough investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she was awarded the prestigious "Mary ’ s Moors ’ Cabot ’ s Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento "TV.
"You have to do the job that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, “What have you done with so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on? ”
The Riodoce ’ s team misses Valdez, the joker who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across the street from the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his ruin?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the matter with Javier happened."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa – just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed. Days before, it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the 104 degree (40 ° C) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-joking, some reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50% of police officers that the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountains, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week ’ s edition, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the assassination of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé of state expenditure, concentrated in the governor ’ s hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block from the prosecutor ’ s office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels for almost the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors were charged with high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this establishment, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have regarded Valdez ’ s column as the best informed source of the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The office of Valdez has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they themselves would never have expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning about another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Three days after Valdez was killed, Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA- tests, that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing down "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organised protests.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington trying to gather international support for the justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
It has since requested that it be reallocated by the government because it is concerned that its anger has violated its objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Narco" Journalism, he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also on orders from politicians and security forces, who are in cahoots with organized crime.
In the past year, more than half of the attacks on journalists were attributed to the police and officials, according to the media.
"You die in Mexico because they want you to shut up," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas' cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as seems to be the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015, three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
For those who lag behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking frightens him.
"Mexico is going to hell, so I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition was already over, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, when all of a sudden all their phones began to hum.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war escalated further, as promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region.
From the kerb they published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled nearby - another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers who were keeping watch to see if they were on standby.
If they were afraid at all, they did not show it.
Under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible throughout Sinaloa, the collaborators of Riodoce followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was assassinated, the intern asked me to send her out on the street to report."
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhino of a Canadian miner have been so well received that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even find that its scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said it had some of a "troubled past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well preserved condition has astounded researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable"
According to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was digging at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He encountered something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink your eyes a little, you could almost believe that it has slept", said the lead author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs" - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs. "
Researchers have found that this herbivore, although covered in armor and resembling a walking armor, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a screening technique known as anti-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to mingle better with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered Countershading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the creature's top was darker than its bottom.
Although countershading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today ’ s animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use countershading - think of deer, zebras, or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur has been subjected to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also retains three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you just squint a little with your eyes, you might almost believe he is asleep. "
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Current Biology, believe that after death Borealopelta sank into the sea and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was digging at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from muzzle to hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds.
It contained two 20 inches long spikes sticking out from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivore was washed through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rare as a lottery win.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates, which carry the skull of the animal.
His right forefoot is at his side, his five fingers spread upward.
I can count the scales at his sole '.
In the thunderstorm: Mass pile-up on the A8: many injured
Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass pile-up.
There are numerous injured, kilometers of jams - and Gaffer.
Around 20 people were injured in a mass pile-up on the Stuttgart motorway (A8) late Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information from the police, around 17.00 Clock between the intersections Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (District Aichach, Friedberg) during a thunderstorm nearly 30 Vehicles, including probably trucks, crashed into each other.
At first, no information was available on the exact number of injured persons.
These were mild to moderate injuries, a spokesperson said.
A large contingent of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 towards Munich was completely closed.
A backlog of around ten kilometres formed in the direction of Munich.
As a reporter reports, there were massive obstacles on the opposite lane - by numerous gawks.
The fire department noted down the license plates of the drivers, who now have to reckon with severe penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45 o'clock then still another second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: you sit in the train and sleep without a clue.
Or you are absorbed in your work and just have an ingenious thought.
And then: pufff.
If the conductor comes and wakes you up rudely or tears the passenger out of the workflow.
Ticket inspection.
But the days of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the ticket inspection system.
One simply confirms by mobile phone that one has taken his place and thus cancels the ticket.
There is currently a test run on two routes.
"When the offer arrives, we expand it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year, "said a railway spokesman.
"Comfort check" is what the train calls the ticket cancellation without a conductor.
However, in order to be able to use them, a few prerequisites must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have an online ticket booked - what already most passengers do.
You also have to buy it via the train app, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
Finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check" works like this: You get on the train, calls up your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic validation will then appear on the test customers.
The conductors are notified on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the conductor comes to seat Y at the ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an online ticket that has already been validated.
So you can keep sleeping, keep working, keep silent.
"Check in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendants, simply check in yourself in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Director of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who often travel by train know that, along with delays and missed trains, ticket checks are one of the greatest annoyances.
Because often you have yourself, in any case, but one of the fellow travelers not all the documents that you need for the cancellation of online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card is missing or else a document that has to be presented.
The result is endless discussions between the conductor and the passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or in the open space and delays in checking your own ticket, and ultimately takes the time of the conductor to take care of other matters.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And only on ICE 915 Dortmund, Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart, Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route have not yet been activated.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis-born sat on the bed of an Airbnb ’ apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone in high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," it said.
Confused, as no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the @ TheePharoah handle was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The St. Louis rapper was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year-old boy killed by a white cop in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown ’ s lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to them and their community.
She put down her phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later that evening.
There were photos of the police band and people shouting, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father carrying a sign reading, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed in which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman unlocked his rifle and shouted, "I'll kill you... animals all."
"This is not usual," recalled Ferrell.
"This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical."
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and cried. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father ’ s house and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas from the 11th
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and a fitting crown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and the black condition".
"You remember how I taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I couldn ’ t take them with me, ” Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a climax of... what happened in the past.
She must know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to become free, to liberate ourselves.
Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally experiences no blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman, a child.
I feel I would do her a disservice in keeping her away from it. "
The first stop, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on South Florissant Road, a place across from the police department, which became a camp area as the activists waited for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism has totally changed since August 9," she said, noting that while a student at the University of Missouri, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come. "
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film ’ s co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado, Farrar, just wanted to "document" what was happening.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story you can exploit?"
This skepticism was fueled by countless cases of people, often whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan stated in a recent interview, "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around Death Row.
His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, and along with six other locals followed the Whose Streets? team in the years following Brown ’ s execution.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. We're talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I will be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement was "not a Messiah, a leader, but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
"But I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
Furthermore, Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Life movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who coined the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay.
"Black gay women in leadership positions have supported the movement as a whole," Ferrell said, "and that is why we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything. "
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really being maintained by black women and many black women."
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who shook up this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was at the forefront, because there is so much at stake in a life at these crossroads as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
The Ferguson news cameras have long since disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home: "A chaos".
Yet she clings to a song, and she has been devoted to that memory ever since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "
From "Dream" to "Megalomania": Readers discuss about bit
The bit-and-gallery moves people, although it is far from built.
But the idea of a shopping center at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since its first presentation in 2009.
The topic hardly leaves anyone cold.
Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "No one needs" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents are counting on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the stores, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed to death.
In addition, the gallery is planned on the exact site of the farmer ’ s market hall, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the start of construction.
The gallery "Macher" want to integrate a market hall in the new building - namely to the Beda "square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping in the Bauernmarkthalle almost every week for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women again and again very much.
We also discovered the butcher's shop.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
This is also the case in other cities.
Especially the retail market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent.
But this should not be low for the new project. "
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.
There are already enough of them in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
But since there is not even a proper weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.
After all, the produce offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not acceptable for a retailer.
What a pity, there are almost no specialist shops left and what is left of it will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the Bauernmarkthalle go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit is actually coming.
Or does the ghost bit, the gallery, manage to drive all the shops out of Bitburg? "
George Marquet: "It just won't work.
And a shopping center that stands empty, no one needs.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insanely many - in my opinion - senseless building projects in Bitburg there is no more place.
If the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again. "
A fitting similarity: Artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mann ’ s DNA
In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black, and brown, almost imperceptibly resembling each other - hanging from cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey and Hagborg from dabs and haircuts she received from Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence service, the analyst, served a 35-year sentence after making classified diplomatic news public on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey, Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a trans-woman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.
Through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning, from which 30 portraits of how someone might look with these genomic data have been created, Dewey ’ Hagborg has created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the malleability of DNA – the many ways in which it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations – but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since puberty, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six espionage violations, computer fraud and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photograph - a grainy, black and white selfie, in which Manning is visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat wearing a platinum-blonde wig - to which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey stoffe Hagborg just came away from the great success of her 2012 'Stranger Visions' project.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They did an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn ’ t be visited at the time and she couldn ’ t be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen pals who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning ’ s release only a few days after the book was published, after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.
There is something deep and strong about the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against government informants and transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to inflame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to remedy.
When asked about the strange timing of all these things, Dewey ’ s hagborg said that “things happen for a reason. ”
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture" with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her surname has a heart).
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA, a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist ’ s sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey ’ Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from it is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data are to interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey, Hagborg, whose 2007 video, Spurious Memories, can also be seen.
"The data in DNA can tell so many different stories, so there are 30 of them."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic, a short story.
She shows Manning as she emerges from the disciplinary barracks of the United States with a hands-free telephone in her hand, like King ’ Kong.
"If they shut down your speech, they won," they say.
"So never shut up".
"It came straight from a letter she wrote me," said the artist, who is greeting from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she does, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacra, assembled like hordes of protesters.
This was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Mannings stature), in which her genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey, Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University sought for killing
A nation-wide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who are being searched as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment.
On Monday, warrants were issued for the murder of Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell in Duranleau, as evidenced by the files of the Cook County District Court.
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau, 26, died after several engravings.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on 27 July.
Officials received a phone call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell “Duranleau ” was declared dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stabs as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President for University Relations, said in an E Mail statement that Lathem had now been given a leave of absence and had been barred from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the competent authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an E ’ Mail ’ statement that “we are in contact with the UK police and ready to help the US investigation agencies in any way we can. ”
The testimony added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to surrender.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he urged the suspects to confront the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a phone call from the building manager of the grand plaza, who had just received a mysterious tip stating that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team of Grand Plaza released a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are researching a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will finalize the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has obtained the right to plan and test, in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti Doping).
The WADA ’ s roadmap has been updated in this regard, ” Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap on Compliance with the Code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, there is nothing in it that could give Russia cause for concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
On the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All the measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we won't admit something that doesn't exist. "
Mutko ’ s words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to the Russian outlet RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from WADA ’ s doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Association (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization ’ s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA ’ s Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving “in the right direction ” to be reinstated.
Aldi does not sell eggs anymore
This was communicated by the groups of companies.
It was said in the communication that this was purely a precautionary measure and that no further adverse health effects could be assumed.
From now on only eggs could be delivered to Aldi, which had been tested as negative for fipronil-containing anti-icing agent.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
Launch of “Ups ” that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck of her employees at their e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco and Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources start-up is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employee anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C œSuite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where ’ s the Fitbit for your business? ” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City ’ s start-up Glint, whose software, Analytics, is used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to snap polls and surveys conducted by specific teams, it offers a Heat Map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill down why.
Companies come to realize that at the top of the workplace must remain a culture, so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished.
For start-up ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could exceed $118.7 billion in value by 2020, according to Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber tell-case in disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send bespoke "pulse" surveys, collect real-time confidential responses, and view the warmth maps of their problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous text message hotline, with which employees can report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to be mistreating its employees or behaving unethically, it may face costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee turnover, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint, and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays general counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, issues previously hidden by executives in offices in cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices – can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360 degree view into the experience of employment, ” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday ’ s Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values, and employees ’ commitment more seriously in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took "social media got their way," for companies to realize that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge businesses recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both startup ups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising total capital to $47 million.
Glittering secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the interconnected nature of business, culture, and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they do now.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong, and feel that the work they do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful, ” said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolios are doing well. Companies are doing well when employees are engaged and engaged.
When third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it ’ s no wonder you ’ ll find support.
The data on employee involvement is important according to the experts of the workplace ’ s culture.
But the data is useless if a company ’ s administrators do not take action.
In fact, if a company employee asks for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and discourage employees.
“If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations, ” said Russell Raath, president of consulting at the business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies that have relied too much on data collection.
“Because if you don ’ t follow co-workers will ask themselves,“ Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, according to Errett.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training session to address the issues.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is constantly gaining new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better retention of workers in an industry that is known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It ’ s about 11 p.m., when a lot of UCLA football players are chatting on one side of the team ’ s new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their jersey tops and show their back full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after three hours of practice before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6: 30 a.m. the next morning.
“That ’ s a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days, ” Bruins ’ coach Jim Mora said just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two “days ” of exercises to ease the burden of players, and they ’ ve actually extended their days – at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore the first three trainings of UCLA should start at 19: 15 o'clock, in order to do justice to the already packed timetables of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day on which the Bruins postponed the start of camp almost a week after last season and practiced during the summer school for the first time during Mora ’ s six seasons at Westwood.
They are expected to hold 18 exercises during August, 20 before the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA rule change, even if it adds another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this tremendous burden on them three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep pushing, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great. "
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is over, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of vision of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs clearing a protective net behind a goal post.
Bruins “players ” are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are available during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then get ready to record an exercise there.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it ’ s a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I am not too worried about that.
We have a plan. "
Facebook wants to intensify factual verification in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential fake articles to third party fact-checkers and then display their results below the original post, said the world ’ s largest online-based social network on Thursday. It ’ s one of its efforts to combat fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect potential hoaxes and send them to fact-checkers that will potentially display fact-checking results from the original.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distributors of fake news, many of whom believe that it also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election, and Germany supporting a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings, as they did before the September election there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German, that in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts examination.
“Besides recognizing which stories of third-party fact-checkers are being challenged, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share, ” said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook ’ s news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its message feeds to reduce false messages.
Creating a Comic-strip Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his more recent past, the little Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze of a music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has lived through 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy home in Kent ’ s Bewl River valley, and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshire man with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England 'covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story is illustrated by a different, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
“I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 ’ s who worked for the Jacobins, ” he says.
"This is his thumb print!
And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were part of it.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone so beaten up with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and has lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I overrated my welcome a bit"), all this seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent its days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, reviewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape conservators, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and began to write".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just beginning to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it in the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: “You might think that land conflicts would be boring, ” says Rhodes,“ but there was a birch tree that two families fought over.
Guys, let everything go its way! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revolt of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380 in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Perhaps the two are connected? "
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', which depicts the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).
The Darrell's are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, always running into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell ’ s men solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women – I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys with a talent for courting heiresses. ”
After the end of his assignment at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experience
He has spent two weeks in the wilderness of Finland writing a novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf veiled
With the wrapping of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand (Rundschau from Thursday).
Until Thursday Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August, the highlight of the campaign will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too beautiful for us.
Or? ", the organizers of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their website, which was launched yesterday.
"But we use this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that we, as citizens of Bad Honnefer, are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
The campaign is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is important to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique feature."
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
A mid-five-digit amount can cost the city of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan ’ s fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara advises on retirements and promotion in the officer corps.
This is also the case this week.
At first glance, this is a normal process.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff, as it used to be, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
The five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also participated in the discussions, chaired by the Prime Minister.
The civilians in the YAS were thus in the majority.
The government is tightening the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air force and the navy have been removed.
Since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the wire-puller of the coup attempt.
There have been negotiations since this week in Ankara against 486 people who were allegedly directly involved in the coup attempt.
Already on the day after the putsch Erdogan had called the coup attempt a "gift from God", as he gave him the opportunity to "completely purify" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Discontent in Military Headquarters".
In the General Staff there were concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifested itself, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
The large-scale cleaning of the army and the security forces goes on anyway.
In mid-July, Erdogan issued a decree firing another 7,395 civil servants, including 2,303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be the real masters of the country.
Three times they staged a coup, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
Following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan gradually pushed back the power of the military, not least by invoking the reform requirements of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is purposefully promoting the Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer who sought asylum abroad after the attempted coup for fear of persecution warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If so, such a development could not leave NATO indifferent.
In any case, there are doubts in the Alliance about the readiness of the Turkish army following the purges.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," say NATO diplomats.
Washington Changes the Rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration ’ s plan to change the rules of the green card, said President Donald Trump, cited by the media.
It provides for reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the US gives green cards to citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chains of migration and replace the current system.
This new recruitment process will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate track for Rennsteigshuttle
The future of the Rennsteig shuttle had been discussed again and again in the past months - now it should go very fast.
Before the end of the year, the ramshackle line on which the tourist train runs is to be built.
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteig shuttle in the long term, construction work on the track is to begin this year, according to information from the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue cultivating and refurbishing the Ilmenau Rennsteig route, the state is committing itself to this connection, which is particularly important for tourism", State Secretary for Transport Klaus Sühl explained on Friday in Erfurt.
He estimated the cost of repairing the line at around EUR 2.5 million.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 per cent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalised, Sühl explained.
The ministry and the southern Thuringian Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details.
"This means that the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated", said Sühl.
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
The Rennsteig shuttle is to be ordered regularly in December 2017.
The "Rennsteig" shuttle is a popular train connection between the stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
Over the past few months, a pilot operation has been carried out to test whether the route will be used by a sufficient number of people in order to reorder it in the future.
The track is also dilapidated in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just when you thought that it can ’ t get any crazier in 2017, comes a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex, robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex ， robots are currently a big deal.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex in robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," Mr Sharkey said at the publication of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more worrying as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford ’ s wife look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix ， robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of shyness, and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is best suited to your personality," enthuses the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She may be tired, fixated on conversation, or she may be "in the mood!"
There are many worrisome aspects to the rise of the sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive feminine traits, the allusions to rape when one takes a step towards Frigid (which here means reluctant) Farrah, are the most troubling.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men won ’ t hold sex robots, and while the FRR is noticing their rising popularity, they remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being.
But what transpires from the peripheries can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women ’ s rights around the world are under threat, when there is a president in the White House boasting of having sexually assaulted women.
The most frightening aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale 'is not the graphic images, the entangled bodies and the pierced eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex-and-death robots is to establish a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with porn-star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, in short, when it comes to their "personalities", robots are not real women.
They cannot part with their companion or simply leave.
They have no mediation or background story, nothing to suggest independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or, to put it in the language of 2017: maids
Trump ’ s Great Achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also divided small-scale families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US gave advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s voting relatives.
We are all pretending to make an effort to burst our filter bubbles.
Less noticed has been Trump ’ s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been involved with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kin with whom she fought for decades over politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it strikes me in a broader context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the creepy possibility that his antics will no longer repel us one day.
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario, in which Trump “normalizes ” right-wing Republicans, who suddenly appear to be the epitome of rationality relative to his standards.
Nowadays, I find myself gripped by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s hilarious version of the madman – the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both of which, compared to Trump, do indeed appear to be very mild offenses.
If Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will only need to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we took our children to the Central Park merry-go-round, the largest of the merry-go-rounds in the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don ’ t need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are growling and the animals twisting to look over their own shoulders in fear - are extremely dark and the jingling music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings grow old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the subject of the pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in North London.
Central Park ’ s carousel, however, is still a strangely magical experience, as two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40 ’ s can go there and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given it the full score, but luckily nobody asked about it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same thing, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood with an apologetic grin, while I tired of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left the prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which, according to prison authorities, he suffered after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following a public prosecutor ’ s appeal against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine ’ s Day 2013 by firing at her several times through a door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius, who they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Agency said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth-graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released for school holidays and secondary schools.
In future, three of the dismissal students will go to grammar school, four to secondary school.
School Principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school dismissal, the 29 pupils of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle, which grows up in the chicken farm but is then released into freedom.
The cheerful crowd performed a musical with the title "Der Adler im Hühnerhof auf".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was broken, the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
Afterwards the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the rehearsal of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young cocks wearing cylinders.
The Adler stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The kitten is different from the other kittens (chicks), but belongs to them.
But he would never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader that he felt accepted in his new school.
This was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who repeatedly intervenes in the event of school bottlenecks, and the parents' representatives.
The chick time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She was very reluctant to dismiss her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she could rely on the fourth graders.
At the end all pupils let a song of summer-time and holiday-time sound.
The children were very happy.
Eight first-graders have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal camping in Greece, reported the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by TV.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people camping illegally, including the two Bulgarians, was arrested by the police in Sithonia.
They were released the same day, while an investigation is underway.
The Foreign Ministry reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened up control over free camping and are imposing substantial fines on anyone found to be staying in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software äuse Update for Diesel vehicles: What the people concerned now need to know
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do Diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
Overview of the most important questions and answers.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emission behaviour of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 cars.
Euro behandlung 4 or inferior diesel are excluded from this.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives her estimations:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles with cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
The German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given a precise date.
Daimler has announced that it will write to everyone concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within its framework.
How long should the overall changeovers take?
"Hard to say," says Smetanin.
That depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not yet acting voluntarily when it comes to the environment."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time consuming to get an appointment.
What do motorists do who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait and see.
According to Smetanin, foreign producers would probably follow suit.
Is there now a threat of a massive fall in the price of Euro ’ s 4 cars?
The ACE fears this.
But in the regions where there is a threat of driving bans.

LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center ’ s award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
President Trump ’ s first award ceremony promises to be political.
One of the award winners does not want to come - in protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) belong to the honoured.
The awards will be handed over in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife Melania.
The prizewinner Lear, who became known with progressive TV series, therefore already announced that he would not be taking part in the gala.
He told the New York Times: 'This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of resources - and that is a burden on me'.
59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city livable
Roland Wacker, Haslach ’ s master builder, will retire next year.
The position has already been advertised, but there are few suitable candidates.
Wacker has been a town builder for 31 years.
And he still enjoys his work, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time he is surprised that so far no application fulfills the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
So - under consideration of the regular notice periods - there should be still enough time for a training.
Since Haslach functions for the administrative community as lower building right authority, the applicant must show appropriate conclusions.
The city definitely wants to retain this function.
If they could no longer fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But closeness to the people is important to the city and to him, says Wacker, who reports on a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and the citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, several important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living in", he is sure about the building authority and its employees.
But varied projects will also be on the agenda in the future: the redesign of the former Hukla ’ s area and the Niederhof car park, for example, has been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and stadium renovation is still an issue.
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, "if we get it right," estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun. "
In terms of design, there is plenty of scope for an urban architect.
With Haslach's own building yard and gardening could be reacted to much quite flexibly.
"You can make a difference," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city builder.
In any case, the city architect bears a high responsibility.
He is the builder, "in the end everything runs over my table".
He can count on long-standing employees for care and coordination: Markus Neumaier (building construction) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.
Wacker also hopes that his successor will stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the job and wants to stay."
Because continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further design of the city.
According to information from the city of Haslach, anyone wishing to inherit Roland Wacker should have a degree in architecture as a graduate engineer or bachelor ’ s degree and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of planning and planning law.
The municipal building authority is responsible for building and civil engineering, planning, land acquisition matters, administration of municipal properties, municipal depot with building yard and municipal gardening as well as lower building law authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on pipes: southern line closed
According to police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators assume two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night hours.
Near the scene of the crime, witnesses had observed a pink scooter and a bicycle.
"This goes far beyond a rascal's prank," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to APA.
The perpetrator (s) would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered the train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement traffic could also Penalen the railway customers come to the perpetrators.
Overall, a "considerable" sum was to be expected, said the spokesman.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern line could be led without obstructions.
Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance transport.
Freight trains were not cancelled, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, said that immune cells patrol the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may result.
Experiments have shown that a type of tolerance-enhancing immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more of these immune cells they had ".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environments if the same system works in humans.
The postdoctoral researcher, Dr. Luisa Cervantes "Barragan" investigated a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the stomach, the intestinal tract.
The mice ’ s intestines were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but were absent in the mice without them.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received L. reuteri and the immune cells were formed.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers had L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the fluid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan, the metabolism known as indole 3, lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervante ’ s Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan is a by-product of L. reuteri that develops cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has signed Nemanja Matic as a "genius"
In Manchester United, Nemanja Matic has signed a "genius", believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the final preseason game before UEFA ’ s Superbug against Real Madrid kicks off on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder-up role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the preparations for the Blues ’ Asian tour and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him get ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Nowitzki also started at Aviva ’ s home stadium when Mourinho formed his starting streak, “XI, ” for the season ’ s start.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more signings, but insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" fulfilling three of its four priority signings.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I will be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have put a lot of effort into it."
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and spread across the USA in the form of a dreamliner, which is several thousand kilometres.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner to be.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already done such advertising before.
The number "787" and the Boeing "logo" were painted in the sky.
New low blow for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before the elections.
Just no disturbing fire from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the federation - that was the most important wish of the election campaigners.
This has changed radically since Martin Schulz led the party.
Since then, employees from Willy ’ s Brandt ’ s house have watched with growing horror the events in the SPD ’ s ruling provincial capitals.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even begin to be described in terms of headwinds.
They were deep blows.
And one after the other.
After the surprising end of the green majority in Lower Saxony, the German Christian Democratic Union (CDU) sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red Green can simply not govern reliably", said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising departure of a Green Party member has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) in a severe crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-and-green coalition lost its one vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
Green Party leader Michael Kellner has called on renegade Green Party member Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The conversion to the CDU signifies a clear falsification of the will of the voters.
Elke Twesten must immediately give back her mandate ", said the managing director and campaign manager of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"That may not be true", sighs an SPD politician, when on Friday morning the new bad news reaches the party headquarters.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands after the transition of the Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the provisional climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD.
And no one knows what comes next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland elections in March.
The comrades calmed down at the time with a black eye, nothing more.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything would be different.
That was what it became - and it all got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD reeling, the Dusseldorf insolvency beat the party smoothly.
The comrades laboriously got up again in the following weeks.
Then, as they had just gathered new courage, the G ’ 20 ’ summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of state, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie concert hall while his city was on fire.
And because in crisis communication afterwards he did pretty much everything wrong that can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now also Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW issue and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been under criticism for a long time.
Lousy survey results were added.
Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Weil has been trying harder and harder in recent weeks to set accents in the federation.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to extend his power in Berlin also did not hide comrades in Martin Schulz ’ s entourage.
They let him go, because they promised themselves a stabilization of the party from Weil.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
In doing so, Weil is basically not to blame for the internal party dispute between the Greens of Lower Saxony.
And Schulz certainly did not.
For the time being, the comrades are therefore endeavouring to keep their own ranks united.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and especially at the renegade parliamentarian Twesten.
“It is intolerable and democracy-damaging how Mrs. Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of all others ”, says Matthias Miersch, boss of the party left in the SPD in the parliamentary group, the editorship network Germany (RND).
Mrs. Twesten was not elected because of her person as a direct candidate, but over the Land list of the Green Party of Lower Saxony to the parliament, so the Lower Saxony delegate further.
The logical consequence would be for it to relinquish its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic manoeuvre".
“The voter will before four years was clear: The humans made Stephan because the Prime Minister ”, say Oppermann, which leads the SPD of Lower Saxony as leading candidates into the federal election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU deputy falsifies the election result," said Oppermann further.
He demanded to clarify the background.
I want to know whether there has been more, or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony.
Subsidies for Ortskern III
Who would like to renovate his aged house, can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a review of what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there had been remediation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the remediation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - after all, it is important to promote interior development and not only to open up new construction areas.
On 4 April, the Regional Council of Karlsruhe had given the information that there would be a redevelopment area III.
The subsidy amounts to 833 333 euros, 500 000 euros of which would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a redevelopment area arise?
Schindler went on to say that they will investigate where the "really old" houses are.
It also played a role, however, whether there was any interest in the planned area to be rehabilitated.
If necessary, the area borders could also shift again.
On Wednesday evening, STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the federal state program "Social City", within the framework of which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of housing and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out object-related, i.e. per plot of land.
The redevelopment area would then be defined as a statute.
The funding period from 1 January 2017 runs until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory would first be carried out, in the context of which those involved in the redevelopment area would receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December the statute decision is to take place if possible, so that in the coming year with the reorganization can be begun.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
The aim was to evaluate the urban abuses and to decide when remediation would take place and to what extent.
It is registered for the respective property then also a reorganization note in the land register.
She promised that Pietzschmann would come to Empfingen again and get an idea of the situation.
Gotzel emphasised that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires which will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and which can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Property Curve", which deals, among other things, with the structural condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Household and apartment sheet", information on the size, distribution and occupants of a living space can be provided.
The blue "factory arch" must only be filled in if business premises are operated in the building.
However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures were not eligible.
Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of subsidies works according to the "greyhound principle" - first come, first served.
One could not "reserve" funding for later.
At the end still photos of the project “local core II ” were shown, in order to make a reorganization“ tasty ” to the present ones.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come with a hand motion in the house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a flick of the wrist.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and is now offering the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant is performed according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built both at home and with his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House ’ s advertising costs cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting America ’ s manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to military data left to TIME Magazine.
Sikorsky VH ’ s green white 3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials toured products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Bureau demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this, because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the Deputy Naval Commander for Aviation.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at around 7am on 17 July for the event at 3pm, and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6pm and 9pm that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the restrictions on duty hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
It was not clear from the recordings made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Datasets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're closed," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave an impetus to the reform of health care that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for travel.
But to request their use only for a photograph of a surgical intervention is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the presidential plane was providing taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about his predecessor ’ s use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'Made in America' show - which features products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
The HMX is one of the world's largest air defense systems. The HMX is one of the largest air defense systems in the world.
When Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted among the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "Non-Presidential Support Missions".
The White House said that taxpayers did not shoulder the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX1 has no budget records for the Presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the US Department of Defense hourly rates for 2017, the DoD ’ s reimbursement rate for the VH ’ 3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate.
"Setting the cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates of reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual budget."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At the time, the former White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, defended the helicopter ’ s use for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be contributing to our national security, and I expect hundreds, if not thousands, of people to be dependent on it.
And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to underline this. "
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver ’ s seat of a fire engine.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss facing tricky task
Top tennis player of the second national league, Suchsdorfer SV, will play in the third round of the table.
The TC Blue and White Neuss starts tomorrow from 11 Clock in Kiel at the third table Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite after five games still flawless record, the leader of the second tennis Bundesliga has retained the sense of reality.
Team principal Marius Zay has respect for his opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a similar formation.
Especially in the rear positions I find the team very good. "
The imports from the far north ensure class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to appearances in the Davis Cups.
And they are also strong in doubles, "says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"As always, this will be difficult for us.
You also need a good portion of luck. "
The Neuss team for the trip to the far north stands practically.
His debut for Blue and White could give Maxime Janvier.
If the currently active Frenchman at the Challenger in the Italian Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga game, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who plays at the tournament in Liberec in the Czech Republic, will make his first appearance this season.
The so far undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik, Castillo was yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski still at the ATP Tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both from the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories against the club at the Alster last Sunday, Máté Valkusz could join the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was the number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay to fill up the squad.
How America can harm OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night.
“In its rush to enact the law, ” he cautioned,“ Congress has packed in a few “unconstitutional regulations. ”
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the US advance.
After all, the draft proposes punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Accordingly, investors of the domestic company OMV, which, together with other European companies, is co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2, have been alarmed.
The threat is enormous.
Nevertheless, according to the official statement of the oil company, it is too early to assess the consequences.
Indeed, Donald Trump himself would have to revive the sanctions by means of an executive order.
Twelve weapons are available to him.
"Die Presse" looked at which companies could fend off and which could really hurt them.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Ohne Pablo Escobar wird das Cali Cartel in der Hitreihe von Netflix in den Mittelpunkt gestellt
Despite the second season of Narcos revealed by Pablo Escobars ’ Killer, Netflix ’ s series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first one received its first trailer and featured the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the richest drug trafficking organisation in the world: the Cali ’ cartel.
Led by four powerful godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune500" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl, David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Roll backwards: The city hires 46 kitchen helpers
The city organizes the day care center lunch itself again.
With fixed contact persons for the children and assignment to the team.
In the city ’ s day care centers, the clock is turned back.
As of September 1, the City of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the city ’ s day care centers (day care centers) on its own initiative.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the Youth Services department, this is good news: "We were all very happy".
Cooking continues outside the house: a caterer takes on this task and delivers freshly cooked, chilled food.
The city runs 46 day care centers in the Krefeld area, in 44 children get a hot meal at noon.
Last year, 2800 children sat at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are looked after for 45 hours a week have lunch at the kindergarten," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in the 35 hours of childcare, if children stay until 14 clock."
As of September 1, 46 part-time employees will be in charge of the kitchen: they heat up the delivered food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, hand over the food, clear the dishes, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are permanently assigned to a kindergarten," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group establishments - decides on the number of hours.
"The kitchen helpers are now part of the daycare team," says Pommeranz, satisfied.
"In this way, they are much more involved and it is easier for the vitality management to implement pedagogical concepts".
Because that ’ s also what it ’ s about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help to prepare the food".
The direct connection of the Küchenkraft to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a well-known force in kindergarten, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the daycare facilities – previously also the job of the kitchen staff – will in future be carried out by special cleaning personnel.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has apart from the quality improvement of the kitchen achievement also the charm, which it turned out in the cost comparison between self-direction and outsourcing for the city as the most economical, reads it from the press office.
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited.
"But with around 750 people in the education sector, these hours are not so important," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the UN mission, said hundreds of women will stand in the provincial council elections, three women will stand in the role of vice-president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters will be women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and presidential elections will be held on 5 April.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process, which coincide with the transition from international hostilities to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will move power peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan's democratic success.

GMB ’ s concern about investment in McVitie ’ s Glasgow factory
A union wants to convince managers of biscuit manufacturer McVitie of their long-term commitment to production at their Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of investments at Tollcross ’ s site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be "first to know" when their activities would change.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB invited Scotland McVitie's to "express concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be advanced".
GMB ’ s senior organizer, Drew Duffy, said: “The fact that we are unable to gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and Greater Glasgow, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the context of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie ".
A Pladis spokesperson said: "The branch manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the continued engagement with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. If our operations at the site change, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know. "
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago of Neymar?
The site of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not slacken her pursuit of Neymar after she made an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record breaker?
The sensational approach has fuelled the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 egation club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous one, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
After completion Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is furious at the way Neymar has forced his way out, even though a source near the Catalan executive insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to have one of the best players signed by PSG.
“I ’ m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we ’ ll stand in opposition to them, we ’ ll contact their players, ” said Khelaifi Al.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players signed, there will be consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.

Interview: "Cathedral sparrows" Report relieves Pope George Ratzinger "
The Regensburger Domspatzen "Report on Abuse Cases" exonerates Pope Georg Ratzinger.
This is the opinion of author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report to the abuse scandal with the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.
Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reform movement "We are Church", declared after publication to the German press "Agency", he expected an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral music director Georg Ratzinger, the 93 year old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be of great benefit to the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or their then incorrect assessment of events.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticised the "double standards" applied to the reporting of violence against the cathedral sparrows.
Regarding the assaults in Regensburg nobody doubts that it concerns "shameful and shameful deeds", which had to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is remarkable, so the authoress Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics.
"The habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider this normal," writes Scaraffia.
In an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk (Bavarian Radio), Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said: "You like to go to church and that's a real treat."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "beatings were a normal pedagogical tool" for "coping with cheeky children like me".
It would find it unfair to apply today ’ s standards to past decades, because the world has changed.
Pope George Ratzinger also often appeared in connection with the reports of cases of abuse.
Author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger wrote the volume "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages), is completely wrong.
"I have to defend Georg Ratzinger", says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him", he assesses the results of the final report.
What exactly is written in the 440 page report, which the lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment has submitted?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "with high plausibility", victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen.
The final report on Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, states: "In summary, it can be said that R. the Domkapellmeister often used forms of physical and psychological violence.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accused persons, it is noticeable that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even associate him with positive memories. "
In an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal involving the Regensburger Domspatzen (Regensburg Cathedral sparrows) exonerates Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages "Report on the" Incidents of Exercising Violence on Responsible Persons at the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a contradictory picture of cathedral music director Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became palpable when a cathedral sparrow did not perform top.
How do you view this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble to read the entire 440-page report from beginning to end, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.
Only eight pages are devoted to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside his sphere of influence.
One can only accuse him of having learned of it too late or of not having taken the first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by practically all interviewees as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also gave an excellent certificate, describing him as "warm-hearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by bunches of children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and high emotionality, which sometimes led to outbursts of anger.
The fact that he not only banged with chairs and threw the key ring on the floor, but also slapped and pulled too cheeky boys by the hair or ears, he himself has already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
In order to save his honor, however, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, among parents and teachers alike.
Do you still know such disciplinary methods?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I too experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared with what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at pre-school level, these are, of course, trifles.
One wonders whether it is not rather to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have fallen on him.
Many who have never understood the Bavarian Pope are still working diligently on it.
But the truth is that the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in every respect.
In connection with the report, a great deal was reported in the media on the subject of abuse by the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused in the final report of any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Absolutely no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the cathedral music director.
Not even the parents were initiated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," one of the people concerned said on behalf of the others, "I was very embarrassed."
The real problem in elucidating sexual abuse has been, and still is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choirmaster who would have been a professional colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen assess Ratzinger's pupils' role with regard to the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: An interrogated pupil put it like this: "Concerning sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it is... also really absurd to assume that he of all people... boys have opened up more insistently or more clearly or even sooner than to their parents, boarders, teachers of trust, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that pupils and / or their environment were entrusted to him beforehand could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger must therefore be acquitted of all complicity.
He cannot therefore be accused of not having prevented him or of having brought him to trial.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much to be read of "excesses of violence" by the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former cathedral music director Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report of "looking away".
Does he have to live with this reproach?
Michael Hesemann: That is the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed up to a huge mélange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
Yet that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clear separation: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choirmaster of the Domspatzen.
All this terrible beating-pedagogy, the cases in which boys were downright harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered terribly from it, all happened at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only saw the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
At that time, as most witnesses point out, the subject of "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in whom the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims appreciated R. 's general humanity and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even associate him with positive memories".
All that remains is the reproach of having looked the other way.
But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was told about the conditions in the pre-school.
The first time in 1970 / 71, when he was just starting to establish himself and didn ’ t want to hear anything about the events at a school where he was not active and responsible (according to the witness), and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it he points out to this, "that in the pre-school the caning is still practiced".
Already in view of the danger of negative press releases he recommended urgent intervention.
That was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when corporal punishment had long been prohibited in Bavaria.
Before that, they happened in a legal grey area, as we all know.
It was difficult for him to estimate where the people affected had perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked the other way.
That is simply not true.
It was not until 1980 that caning at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see this?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "pitfall of anachronism", that is the danger to evaluate the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which has always been abominable, nor to the atrocities and violence committed in pre-school against innocent children ’ s souls, which goes far beyond what was common at the time.
That is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked through.
At the same time, however, I must defend Georg Ratzinger, because none of this had anything to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, i.e. slapping his face and pulling his hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also adhered strictly to it.
What image of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger reproduce in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Was the issue of caning also raised?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book deals with the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the Domspatzen only played a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not at all conceal the fact that he led a strict regime there.
But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class status out of the Regensburger Domspatzen (Regensburg Cathedral Sparrows), which until then was rather nationally known, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and sweets alone, you don ’ t make recalcitrant boys into great singers, and before every success, no matter in which field, you always have discipline, passion and self-conquest.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger as when talking about your book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, kind, deeply believing and kind person, of whom one cannot imagine that he could harm even one fly.
I regularly hear how many former Domspatzen still keep in contact with him today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.
Those who to this day do not forgive him that he was once strict with them are therefore clearly in the minority.
Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today for having enriched their lives and brought them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovable respecter to whom they still look up today and to whom they almost adore.
And please, once again very clearly: all he is accused of is educational methods, which were the order of the day at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unfair to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
The report that has just been published discharges him.
Now the decency would order to leave a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merits and without whom outside Bavaria and perhaps still Germany probably no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.
