Four members of the Kemerovo group were arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to the postman, the police in Spain detained the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underground, Slava Gulevich, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested by court order.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspects are members of the so-called Kemerovo crime syndicate, aged 27 to 57, who are primarily involved in drug crimes.
In the province of Malaga, Spain, an alleged leader of a criminal organization was arrested in Mijas.
In Estonia, three men were arrested as suspects, one of whom is a leading figure in the criminal community according to the data collected and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected suggest that the criminal association had a clear division of tasks and roles.
The purpose of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug crimes and thus to earn criminal income", commented the head of the pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case, State Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not exclude that the number of suspects in this criminal case will increase", the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the eyes of law enforcement before, and some of them have served time for drug offenses.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues was important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become a routine for us and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation", commented Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said the arrests were preceded by a nearly one-and-a-half-year preliminary investigation.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work was carried out and we simultaneously arrested suspects in Estonia and Spain", he said.
You added that the Central Criminal Police officers were helping with the detention in Spain.
For years we have had good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and the civil guard.
These arrests are another message to criminals that we will catch them from the other side of Europe", said Leis.
The information gathered so far shows that while at liberty, the suspects may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor's office requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain awaits extradition to Estonia.
In the context of this criminal case, property, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in criminal cases are conducted by the Central Criminal Police's Organized Crime Bureau and are conducted by the State Prosecutor's Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Estonia was considered the second most important man in the criminal world after the Gullevitz-tone underground leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevit≈°, from Kemerov, rose to prominence in the Estonian underground in the early 1990s when he began to engage in blackmail in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes working at various hotels and demanded a monthly roof tax from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of proceeds of crime and convictions in force confirm the effectiveness of the fight against organised crime.
For example, the recent judgments, in which eight defendants were separated from the so-called Dikaev criminal association, from whom the proceeds of crime amounted to EUR 80 000, or the judgments against nine persons in which Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illicit trade in cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to human trafficking in Eastern Viramund and Southern Estonia.
The amount of confiscated proceeds of crime is almost EUR 71 500.
In these criminal cases, success has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information and evidence with their foreign counterparts on a daily basis and that prosecutors can, if necessary, conduct joint operations in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns against traveling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri about the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The NAACP Travel Notice for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28, 2017, calls upon all African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to exercise extreme caution and caution when traveling throughout the state, in light of the racially suspicious incidents that have recently occurred across the state and have been reported here".
According to the NAACP, the group was prompted to issue the travel advisory by both a recent Missouri law that makes it harder to win discrimination cases and the fact that the state's law enforcement agencies are disproportionately targeting minorities.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are teased because of the color of their skin, they are beaten or killed", said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri chapter of the NAACP, to The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had complaints this frequently before".
This is the first such warning issued by the organization to a U.S. state.
The group cited incidents such as racist insults directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died earlier this year under suspicious circumstances after he ran out of gas while driving across the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped than white drivers in the state.
"The purpose of the notice is to make people aware and to warn their families, friends and coworkers about what may be happening in Missouri", Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared, whether it means taking bail or letting relatives know they're coming through the state".
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, which ranks the state 16th in the nation for the number of similar violations.
The travel advisory is also in response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for a company to sue for discrimination in housing or job search.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws requiring local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, because the ACLU said it increases racial profiling.
While the Department of State usually issues travel warnings for other countries, interest groups have recently begun to use this measure in response to certain domestic laws and trends in the United States.
Hepatitis: What should anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or hepatitis, can be caused by five different types of hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver.
The most costly, however, is chronic hepatitis B and C, which can progress to cirrhosis of the liver, or cirrhosis of the liver, and liver cancer.
Kuulo Kutsar, an epidemiologist at the National Health Service, says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of hepatitis - fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, grayish stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The latter symptom is also the source of the folk name for liver inflammation, jaundice.
Hepatitis in children may be asymptomatic.
The different types of hepatitis can only be determined from laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can become chronic and go unrecognized for decades, meaning that a person may not know about his or her dangerous liver disease.
The consultant will identify the different forms of hepatitis and describe their course.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from one person to another and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water, by having sex, by passing feces on and from infected persons to food, surfaces, objects, mouth, and drugs.
The risk group for hepatitis A infection includes family members and caregivers, people with chronic liver disease, people who have sex with an infected person, men who have sex with men, drug users, and travelers visiting countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular, vaccination is recommended for people who travel frequently and are at risk for hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to observe daily hygiene practices: wash or disinfect your hands before eating any fruit or vegetables.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread through contact with the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattoos, licking, use of blood-contaminated objects (toothbrushes, shaving products), donor blood, sex with a person who is suspected of having hepatitis B, and from a mother to a fetus/ newborn baby with hepatitis B.
Those at risk for hepatitis B include injecting drug users, sexual partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health care workers, first responders and police officers who come into contact with blood and other bodily fluids, and travelers visiting countries with high incidence of hepatitis B.
It is possible to vaccinate people to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, it is recommended that people at risk, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes, should be vaccinated.
Other prevention measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene products, manicures, other sharp substances, needles, tattoos, and needles, and avoiding condom use during contagious sex or risky sexual behavior.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation scheme in Estonia and is free for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are transmitted through contact with the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattoos, injections, use of blood-contaminated objects, donor blood, sexual intercourse with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from a mother to a fetus/ newborn baby with hepatitis.
The risk groups for hepatitis C include injecting drug users, sexual partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, healthcare workers, first responders and police officers in contact with blood and other bodily fluids, persons with HIV infection, and travellers visiting countries with high incidence of hepatitis C.
The following are the prevention measures for hepatitis C: avoidance of the use of foreign hygiene products, manicures, other sharp substances, needles, tattoos, and needles, and the use of condoms during contagious sex.
There is no vaccine for hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are transmitted through contact with blood and other bodily fluids, contaminated syringes, sexual contact and, rarely, from an infected mother to her fetus.
People at risk of hepatitis D are chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus and people who are not immune to hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with a hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person against infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses are transmitted via the fecal-oral route through drinking water and food, including by eating low-processed meat, fish and shellfish, donor blood, shared syringes and from infected mothers to their unborn children.
Travellers may be infected in countries with a high incidence of hepatitis E.
Hepatitis prevention measures include hygiene measures: washing or disinfecting hands after using the toilet, before cooking and eating, and after caring for the sick person.
Wash fruits and vegetables before eating, avoid eating low-processed meat, fish, and seafood, drink only safe drinking water, and abstain from drug use.
Despite competitors trying to push the four-time Olympic champion off the track in the final round, Farah, 34, found strength in the final round, winning in a time of 26.49.51.
Farah did not think long enough to pull her husband, Tanya, and children onto the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
It was wonderful to be with them on the track", Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for her fifth consecutive title in London, the 5000 and 10,000 metres gold medals.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "The Lady in Gold: The Extraordinary Story of the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, a Masterpiece by Gustav Klimt" delves into the cultural life of Vienna at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, far deeper than the birth of one single work of art.
But even more deeply into history.
It would take a more powerful knife, a narrower subject, to make the extraordinary portrait in the title more effective.
Now there are two books between the covers: the story of Gustav Klimt and his painting "The Lady in Gold" by Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a much more comprehensive history of respected Jewish families and the German occupation and its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book is centered on the vibrant cultural life of Vienna, and those who have been to the Austrian capital can easily imagine what life was like in the Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago or how everyone in the Central Cafe turned their heads when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural writers was high in one of Europe's most affluent cities, and seeing a familiar name in a book makes you feel like a grammar-language cultural writer.
But the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city where there was an untreatable syphilis and the highest suicide rate in Europe, for example, doesn't seem to add anything to the story.
Or perhaps even every few lines of a brushstroke adds color to the cultural life of early 20th-century Vienna.
A Dream of a Trip to the Soviet Union
By the last decades of the 19th century, the Jewish population of Vienna had grown exponentially, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, nearly one in ten Viennese were Jews.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch, who had opened it twice, and posed for Klimt for his famous paintings, her father's bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet didn't take all the glamour she was meant to have.
When you look at "Lady in Gold", it's hard to believe that towards the end of her life, this great lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his husband from Klimt, he was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt's order at the time cost 4,000 crowns, a quarter of the price of a well-placed country house.
The fact that some of the portraits were suspected of being modeled after the master's love story did not deter the sugar magnate.
As for Adele, the only certain fact is that the close relationship that developed during her work with the model and the artist lasted for the rest of her life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Lady of the gold.
The extraordinary song of the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, masterpiece by Gustav Klimt, Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before he began working with Adele, Klimt had visited the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, and researchers believe that it was the splendid mosaics of Empress Theodora seen there that gave the artist the idea to make a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Lady in Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and at about the same time (1907-1908) another golden painting, "Kiss", was born.
Art historians have not missed the resemblance between the two women.
What does this have to do with Hitler?
"I think that in memory of my friend Klimt I owe it to him to make his handiwork available to the public", Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of the Belvedere Museum a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) and wished that their Klimt family collection would go to the museum.
Six years before he died, Klimt had painted another portrait of Adele.
In her will (Adele left in February 1925) she also asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four landscapes by Gustav Klimt to the Austrian Gallery.
He left his property to his nieces, Maria and Louise.
A year after Klimt had completed "Austria's Mona Lisa", 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to enter the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, but failed a drawing test.
While Hitler's later anti-Semitism is sometimes attributed to his rejection by Jewish professors at the academy, none of his test subjects were actually Jews.
By 1939, however, the mission of the Austria Gallery, mentioned in Maria's will, had changed dramatically - it had become important to find works of interest to the Nazi Party from the rich Jewish art collections in Vienna.
Hitler's personal art collection included some works from Adele's home, but not those of Klimt.
Sixty years after the Nazi art heist, a decade-long legal battle between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauer heirs began.
Let it be noted here that if "Kiss" is seen in the Belvedere in Vienna, "Lady in Gold" by Adele Bloch-Bauer should be seen in the Neue Galerie in New York.
And before you go to Vienna, read the book I mentioned.
Even if you're not planning on going to see Klimt's work, because at least my emotions after the book closed were more about Nazi and Jewish themes than the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer sold for $135 million.
So not so much a portrait as a family tale, and a very moving story.
The Bauer family tree at the beginning of the book made it remarkably easy to find out what was going on.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada.
In the previous year, Gold was very close to his own 200-meter breaststroke personal best in swimming with a time of 2.16.62.
The milestone comes from a 17-year-old swimmer who set a time of 2:16.58 at the Canadian Junior Championships last week, according to the Priit Desert Swimming Blog.
Gold was the last, maybe the tenth, to make it to the A-finals.
In the final, he completed the distance in a time of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new strong finish.
Gold was slightly more than half a second behind the Estonian record held by Alina Kendzior (2:15.13).
Gold rose to third place in the Estonian all-time leaderboard and his recent personal best is Estonia's fifth all-time result.
The young prospect is still in the running in the 100m, 200m and 400m freestyle and the 200m and 400m complex at the Canadian Senior Championships.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships were held in Toronto, and Gold made a successful start there as well.
She won the silver medal in the 200-meter freestyle with a time of 2.03.22.
The last time an Estonian swam this distance was in 2008.
Only the Estonian record holder Elina Part√µka has swum this distance faster than Gold.
The Estonian, who lives in Canada, won another bronze medal in the 100 m freestyle with a great personal record and the best score of the new Estonian season with 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, who is one year older than he, has swum the distance only a century faster.
He reached his personal best in the 100m backstroke with a time of 1.03.69 in the opening heat.
At the half-longest distance, he only finished seventh, swimming in the final with a time of 2:17.31.
Gold currently leads the Estonian season standings at four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics grit their teeth
It's holiday season, which means a relaxing time for U.S. President Donald Trump.
But since Trump has been one of the most vacation-minded presidents to date, critics are already grinding their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president plans to spend 17 days at his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president's vacation began yesterday, the anti-Trump campaign has been talking about the vacation for weeks.
They're blaming Trump for taking too much rest.
Well, the president spends his weekends in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days in office.
For example, George W. Bush had been on vacation for 67 days by that time, and Barack Obama had been on vacation for 21 days, half as long as Trump.
But Trump has a quick-forget-it-all tendency.
In the days after he was elected, Trump said on "60 Minutes" that he would not have time for long vacations during his term because there was so much to do.
He also expressed his anger three years ago over Barack Obama's vacation.
The current president tweeted at the time: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is beating journalists to death".
White House officials say a 17-day visit to a golf club is not exactly relaxing.
It's officially called a vacation, during which Trump doesn't have time to read or do any other leisure activities.
Besides, there had to be another reason for the leave.
The air conditioning system in the West Wing of the White House is being replaced, and all staff have had to leave.
The Oval Office and other presidential offices are also located on the west wing.
"I don't think any of you would want to be in the west wing in August when it's 38 degrees and there's no air conditioning", said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president will continue to work during the holidays.
You can get a sense of where President Trump is spending the next 17 days from this video.
Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism from voters
Our father knew so much about the unfavorable media era.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to start teasing him about everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of speech may be taken from us, and by silent silence we may be led like sheep to the slaughter".
Which brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who's going to have to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan's followers have blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's office dismissed the lawsuit, and online comments were rife with "Who cares?" reactions.
"It's just Facebook", many said.
But it does.
And that matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
That's a staggeringly large outsider to a popular Republican governor in a predominantly Democratic state.
His approval rating is second best among the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not a thoughtless, reactionary moron.
He has led the state with a firm hand and has remained strictly committed to his principles.
He has also used Facebook rather coolly as his main means of communicating with his constituents, for example by showing off his bald head for the first time since his chemotherapy.
So blocking people from visiting the Governor's Page - which is an officially labeled public forum run by a staff that's paid for by taxpayer dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chase defended the governor's behavior in an interview with The Washington Post, claiming that the blocking of comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of Internet trolls, junk mailers, or angry people on the web.
The Post interviewed several real people that Hogan blocked.
And that's what they are -- real people interacting with their elected leaders -- the teacher, the business owner, the pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not at all silly.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing Hogan's Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Raman, a lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, was not inciting anger, but about actual hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that he had not reacted to hate crimes or other recent news", he wrote in a commentary column for The Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same topic, some people immediately call it a collective effort, rather than admitting that it's a big concern for a lot of citizens".
What the governor's office called a "targeted spam attack" would probably be called "public support" by others.
The Facebook era makes it easy to match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than in the old days, when the same thing had to be done by sending out workers to gather up critical newspapers and burn them or arrest protesters and silence them.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for tearing Facebook and other social media outlets apart.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have blocked his Twitter feed.
One of the first significant court decisions on this matter was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors representative violated the First Amendment by blocking a voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington, affordable postal services had the same effect as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the quadrupling of newspapers and the anonymous correspondents perplexed his management.
And even then, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to the papers under pseudonyms like Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making the decisions in Washington unpopular.
According to historical documents collected as part of the online George Washington Letter Collection Project, his cabinet was buried under petitions criticizing his views on friendship, trade and shipping treaties with Britain.
But he didn't keep them quiet.
Freedom of speech, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And to lead properly is to accept it.
Ronan Rafferty is counting on the comfort of home turf at the Renaissance Club.
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty is looking forward to the comfort of home territory over the next three days as the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place at the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf course.
The Northern Irishman, who last year led the neighbouring Archerfield Links before surrendering to Paul Ealese, is committed to the new venue and will take over from founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad as tournament ambassador.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and now we see the club shining in its full glory with this event", Rafferty said.
"The players see the track at its best, it's in excellent condition.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He is a keen supporter of golf and is proud of what he has achieved here.
This allows the track to be presented in a great way".
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending his first title, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a very special feeling", said the Southport-based player.
"I couldn't defend my title at the Extremadura Open because it was taken off the calendar a year after I won.
It's magical to come back to this place.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember last year, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year was a special win.
It was a very special time that will always be in our hearts".
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year, is returning to the home circuit.
It is his first event in Scotland since competing in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"Playing at home is always a little more meaningful", said Orr, a man from Helensburg.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and I've shown quite a decent game of golf.
I'm happy with the way things are going".
The trio will be joined on the field by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of six Scotsmen in the race, the rest of them being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free and parking costs ¬£5 for a car with one passenger and ¬£10 for a car with two or more passengers.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Gold-Rich Country
When Bardina Dege makes dinner, she doesn't use a brick.
He rarely even uses the pot.
In a wooden cottage in Enarotal, the capital of the ruling province of Paniai, in the remote province of Papua, Indonesia, a housewife places a potato, known locally as nota, directly in front of the fire.
After half an hour, the charred mugs are taken from the fire and diligently applied to the skin with unwashed hands.
Sitting on the muddy floor - she has no furniture - Dege also does her daily household chores, such as washing laundry with the cloudy water from a nearby stream.
The bucket is the toilet in a room without a roof.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has not been assigned to care for any of the fields.
Polygamy is common in this country.
Working late can be dangerous, though - most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after five o'clock in the evening", he says.
This is a rare glimpse of life in the mountainous country of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elderly people were forced to vote with their hands up in front of the occupying forces.
The movement for liberation from Dutch rule quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which still maintains a tight grip on the region, keeping foreign journalists and human rights monitors out.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, leaving the eastern part of the island to independent Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is both remote and abandoned, and it takes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapur to reach Nabir, then a five-hour trek in a rented car.
There's no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo groves and covered with wavy iron roofs, the rust of which has turned them into yellow browns of various shades.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and there have been almost no foreigners here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago Paphu worshipped a god named Uga Tame.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing clothes like this", says Dege, referring to his colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse, and loose skirt.
"Before, we only wore leaves".
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it is also a gold-rich country in Indonesia.
Just 60 miles [100 km] from Panya, a mountainous province of about 153,000 people in New Jersey, is the Grasberg mine, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, owned by Freeport McMoran, a Phoenix-based company.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about US$3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua boasts a supply of timber worth an estimated $78 billion.
But these riches are a source of suffering for the Papuan people, for they are the stifling presence of the mighty Indonesian military.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local military personnel and units approximately US$20 million, including up to US$150,000 per officer.
The Papal States' efforts to secure greater autonomy threaten this golden age and they are treated with ruthlessness.
Human rights activists say that since 1969, more than 500,000 baboons have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killing of the Papuan tribes in the mountainous areas in the 1970s amounted to genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested over 3,900 peaceful protesters in the area.
The 2016 report of the Archdiocese of Birsbane, "We are losing everything", contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (with one other report stating that rape and electrocution are particularly common), and the brutal suppression of peaceful protests.
"It is difficult to quantify the number of victims because such incidents occur every week", says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws are even tighter because Papua's natural resources have caused an influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but the demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Javanese family restaurants sell gado-gado with crumbs and mixed vegetables, served with peanut butter.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables at a traditional marketplace that was cheaper than the local shoe", explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old from Panya who moved to the provincial capital, Jayapura, for work.
"The local poppies - the poppy mama-mama [women] - are losing market share as a result".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed during his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights abuses in Papua.
The former carpenter won Paapua 29 out of 27 constituencies, including Paniai, on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace.
But little has changed in Papouas, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes for restoring justice", You says.
In fact, Paniai was in a lowly position just two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children were singing Christmas carols at a lake in Enarotli when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle out of the darkness.
The children who gathered told them that they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said that the soldiers, drunk, chased the children and beat them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was beaten so severely that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby Election Commission building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated even further.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women, and children gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting vests and performed the waita dance of the Papua mee pago tribe, which involved running around and imitating the song of birds.
Some protesters began throwing rocks at police and military.
In a fit of rage, orders were sent to the soldiers over the domestic radio. "If the crowd shows more than three times the resistance, shoot them", according to an official document seen by TIME magazine but not released to local media.
Jeremiah Kayame, a 56-year-old elder in Kego Koto, Enarota, felt threatened and called for peace by asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"As I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist", he told TIME magazine in his bright colors on the porch of the log cabin.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the soldiers' rallies.
"The people were many, the sword was many", he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was shot three times, according to a cousin who witnessed his shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him", said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, sadly, to TIME magazine.
"I saw that he was dead... and I kissed him".
Yotje Mende, the chief inspector of the Papua police, told reporters that his subordinates were only providing security for their own precinct because it was under attack.
"We have to protect ourselves when we are threatened with death", said Papua Police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death".
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
News of the killings didn't reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the abuses in Papua.
"I want this case resolved now so that it never happens again in the future", he said.
In October 2016, Minister for Security Wiranto said that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism to deal with crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately, there were excuses.
"Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of these were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes", he said.
Speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto retracted his words, saying he had no intention of setting up a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "everything will be done according to the law".
Wiranto, who has been charged by the UN with crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the bloody 1999 independence referendum, said 11 crimes against human rights have already been solved in Papua, including the one in Panayi.
The families of the victims of the panic were deeply disturbed by such claims.
"I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made", said Yohanes.
"I'm tired. "
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm scared", he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot".
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Panea are afraid to separate this incident.
He said he got beaten up by the military after helping bury four victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army came looking for me", he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the Paniai neighbourhood of Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, when a conversation broke out between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
This gentleman, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site outside the company office.
Police said villagers threw stones at the officers, who responded with warning shots.
But according to local reports, mobile brigades (Indonesian military police) opened fire on the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in a panic, afraid of retaliation", said 29-year-old Dominggu Badie, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded enter.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days".
The Parliament of Deiyai has demanded that the police officers involved in the case be held accountable and that the police mobile brigade be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of measured development fuels the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damali tribes in the sprawling central highlands of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papua people, by carrying out random attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL's predecessors are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, the military has arrested Paniai and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in recent years under the pretext of "protecting the sovereignty of the state".
Some of them never come out.
Among the Papuan people, Pani is known as "the tragic forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discontent.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotal is too expensive for the locals to buy.
The bread is just as unavailable.
People grow all their food themselves - mostly potatoes, plus some fruits and vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can tend four or five potato fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, selling the rest at the local market.
Ten potatoes are only worth 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
The economic disparity between the native Papuan population and the new migrants, who have arrived in large numbers since the opening of the new routes at Nabire Airport, has deepened over time.
The few jobs that exist go to better educated and more affluent migrants.
The poor themselves often lack the capital or skills needed to run a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying because there are no jobs or money", says John Gobai, chairman of the Panay Tribal Council.
Separation keeps the world's eyes off the Pope.
In addition, there will be strict restrictions on the use of external media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua for "not observing proper customs", despite the rare filming permit they had been given.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election promises to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"In Indonesia, journalists from Papua's most troubled eastern provinces and West Papua are facing new threats - visa denial and blacklisting", he said in a statement.
The lack of a scrutiny of the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's close neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "a wide range of crimes" in Papua, including the shooting in Panay.
Historically, the VPL has also been supported by countries in need.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic order and a free press, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of human rights violations".
The locals want more attention from foreign governments.
When an official Dutch delegation led by the country's human rights envoy, Kees Van Baer, visited Jayapura on May 4, the locals broke their silence, according to a source who was present but wished to remain anonymous, urging: "We want freedom".
Indonesia is holding a new presidential election in 2019, but the papas don't believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are connected to the shooting in Paniai", says Hobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Joko to understand that in addition to the constant threat of predatory armies, the people of Panya are in dire need of Nigerian education and health services.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like all other papas, consider their vote for Jokowi a debt to be paid.
"They don't want money, they want justice", he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting managed to make one last symbolic counterattack - they buried the body of one victim in the ground opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be served, they at least don't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed", says Yacobus, his head bowed.
"What else could we do?"
Fire engulfed the Dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time
Fire swept through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-tall, 79-story building.
This is the second fire in just two years to devastate the high-rise, which is also known as the Torch.
The building was evacuated, no injuries reported, and no direct cause of the fire was reported.
"We slept and woke to the sound of fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor", a resident who identified himself as George told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Defence officials said firefighters extinguished the blaze at around 4am local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may raise further questions about the safety of materials used in high-altitude outdoor surfaces around the world.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the compatibility of the measures in question with the internal market.
British police have said they believe that the insulation and facade panels of London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June, which killed about 80 people.
Look, these phones are probably going to hit the shelves in the fall.
Spring and autumn are sweet times for tech-savvy people, for they are when phone manufacturers release their new top models.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium are coming in the spring, and new hit phones are expected to hit the shelves in the fall.
According to Tele2's marketing and sales director, Kristjan Seema, the new models are characterised by the innovative design of the flagship, the eye-scanner, the 4K-resolution screen from the edge to the server and the ultra-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8 has also been a big hit in the technology world, reaching the top of the Estonian smartphone sales chart.
Autumn promises even more expansive fast charging, a more durable battery, a better quality camera, and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that the consultations already allowed to make assumptions and predictions about the four top models that are likely to dominate the sales charts this year.
These four flagship smartphones will hit shelves in the fall of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should hit shelves as early as mid-September.
Rumors about what the new Apple model will look like and what you can do with it are going around a lot.
If the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences compared to the iPhone 6s, then on Apple's tenth birthday, the new model is expected to be completely different from the previous ones.
Four colors are mentioned: black, white, pink gold, and chrome.
One element of the new design is probably the screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is gone, and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple's design director, JonyIve, is demanding that the new iPhone model look like smooth glass.
There was talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the eye-scanner, wireless charging and even better camera quality, you can expect a faster A11 processor.
It's definitely one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
The pre-orders for the new Galaxy Note 8 will start on August 23.
There's been a lot of rumors leaking about what the new Galaxy Note 8 is going to look like.
It's supposed to be even more business-friendly, and the S Pen allows for even more functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a rainbow and the other with a narrower telephoto lens.
At the moment, no one knows what the dual rear camera capabilities are, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
But we're going to wait until August 23rd.
While Nokia has launched three flagship smartphones this year with the Nokia 6, there is still a lack of their flagship, the Nokia 8, which will be unveiled as early as August 16.
We expect Nokia to come with a 5.3-inch, wide-screen display and a super-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
Nokia is also mentioned as having an aluminium body and a significant water and dust resistance rating of IP68.
Similar to Samsung, the new Nokia model has two rear cameras, the optics of which are manufactured by Zeiss.
While Sony's firm flagship has been the XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We're expecting a smartphone that's a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least as good or better camera.
Sony's new model is speculated to have a screen of at least six inches.
What the reality will be is something we'll see soon, because traditionally Sony has unveiled its fall flagship at the IFA International Technology Fair, which runs from September 1 to 6 this year.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post has released transcripts of telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and the heads of state of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27th, Trump made a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop the latter from publicly announcing that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States was banging on the wall for public condemnation, saying, "You can't tell the press".
Trump has built on his presidential campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange of views.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would accept refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous", "ridiculous" and "stupid". He claimed that the agreement made under the Obama administration would make him look like a "guide" because he has proposed a ban on resettling refugees to the United States.
Trump ended his speech by telling Turnbull that it was "the most unpleasant call of the day".
The Court of Justice did not consider the complaint of O√ú MRP Linna Linid in the case where the City of Tartu rejected their offer to purchase bus transport from July 2019 to 2029.
The order refused the offer of O√ú MRP Linna Linid to the Tartu bus operator because the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, head of the Tartu Municipal Rights Service.
The contract is for public bus services within the city of Tartu for the period from 01.07.2019 to 30.06.2029.
MRP Linna Lines appealed the decision of the Tartu District Court to the Supreme Court.
The state court didn't take it up.
Although many complain on social media that the noise from the Weekend Festival is disrupting their nighttime routine and the city is full of drunken partygoers, there are many who have not a bad word to say about the beach festival.
I'm even surprised that the shop was so polite!
I didn't see any bad manners or any disrespect.
I even saw kindness", says Laine, a descendant of the family.
"It's nice to come, to be, and to feel the joy of P√§rn, which has been like a winter's sleep in winter", he adds cheerfully.
The shallow, dark wave from the beach doesn't disturb sleep.
If living in the city center, he could hear music playing on the beach, now music has not yet reached his home.
"But I hope to hear", he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who spoke to the newspaper, also said that the big festival is rather good for P√§rnu - it helps the local merchants to turn a profit.
He is also happy that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
The party noise doesn't bother a woman.
I may not be spending my days on the beach anymore, but I'm glad the beach is alive.
And it's nice that people are moving, and it's been three times", she says.
I think the first time was a little worse.
"Then there may have been complaints", he muses.
But he says that the noise on the beach is normal for summer residents.
"This weekend is a great promo for our little town", says Harry, who is cuddling in the park.
Noise and noise have not affected his rhythm.
But for what?
We should all stick together.
Think about how this inter-ethnic communication would be better.
Noise music doesn't crush a man.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live right next door.
"Good people can stick together and there's no trouble", he says.
He says the guests at the inn are very polite.
"They've gone a little overboard with the poodles, of course, but the young are young and, my goodness, let's go, but be human and we'll get through this!" she says.
By then, the coastal inhabitants have traveled far away to their relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive effect on life - people like that kind of noise", says Tiina, who walks with the children in P√§rnus.
His family's dream of music festivals doesn't bother them either, although last year it got even further from the street.
Last summer, the stage was reversed, so we heard more.
We live outside the city, which is actually quite well settled there, far away by the P√§rnu river", he says.
Pearson is cutting another 3,000 jobs and cutting dividends to revive the business.
British education firm Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its dividend by 72 percent, launching yet another restructuring program to address the business's threat of a downturn.
The job losses, which CEO John Fallon said would most likely be made at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, will be in addition to the 4000 jobs lost in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May plans to cut a further ¬£300 million ($394 million) in spending under the third cost-cutting programme to try to revive the business, which has been hit by a rapid shift to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that its expectations for the year had not changed since it reported a 1% increase in sales revenue to ¬£2,05 billion in the first half of the year.
Sunday, with heavy rains, continues the summer's warmth.
In Estonia, the weather is warm in summer with heavy rains and the possibility of thunderstorms on Sundays, and wind gusts are sometimes very strong.
At night, the weather in Estonia will be cloudy and clear.
It's raining in many places, it could be thunder.
Winds are 5-11 from the southwest, up to 14 on the islands and coastline, up to 60 feet per second.
The air temperature is 13 to 17 degrees.
The day will be cloudy and cloudy.
It's raining in several places, and there's a chance of thunder.
Winds are 6 to 12 from the east, up to 15 on the islands and coastline, up to 20 m/s.
The air temperature is 18-21 degrees.
Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
NATO said five soldiers and a translator were wounded.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabagh district of the city.
This bombing is the latest in a series of violent incidents that have hit Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in a mosque attack in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion on Thursday night occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "human-carried homemade explosive device".
The statement said all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airfield.
According to correspondents, the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) in Qarabagh is a serious concern for NATO forces in Bagram.
The UN estimates that at least 1,662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which approximately 20% in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul, mostly in the Shiite area.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, a major bomb attack in the city centre killed more than 150 people, the deadliest military attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
This violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump considers whether to increase the number of US troops supporting the country's military and police.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a crisis of public confidence in the government, its politicians and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reversed the decision to stay the order after the appeals
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay the Obama administration's mandate to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, one day after 15 states sued the agency for its actions.
The EPA announced its decision to resume "the 2015 ozone measurement activities" late Wednesday, saying it demonstrates the agency's commitment to cooperating with states.
"We believe we need to engage with our state partners and listen to them", EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June that the EPA was planning to postpone the determination of ozone levels - which measure the levels of pollution in different parts of the country to determine where it should be reduced to meet the strictest air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
Fifteen predominantly Democratic states joined the District of Columbia in filing a lawsuit Tuesday, saying the decision was unlawful.
President Donald Trump's administration has been trying to roll back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, which Trump says is part of a broader plan to market growth.
But these efforts have sparked backlash from Democrats and conservationists who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhaling air containing ozone "may reduce the ability of the lungs to function and increase the risk of respiratory diseases", such as asthma.
The German pigs may have a party.
German pigs and cattle may be having a feast as heavy rains threaten the crops of the second-largest milk producer in the European Union, reports Bloomberg.
This year, weeks of drought before harvest may mean that the fruit used in the bakery industry is suitable only for animal feed.
'The quality of the soil is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015,' said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat could be used for animal feed, double the usual amount, forecast Agraves.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
At first, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by the hot spring in June.
In July, Germany was hit by a hailstorm, which has continued into August.
Many eyes are on northern Germany, where rain is hindering the harvest.
Only five percent of the wheat has been harvested so far.
In most areas, harvesting has not even begun, reported Ceravis, a local harvest collector.
"These are some tough days", said Frank Deckert, a senior Ceravis dealer in Rendsburg.
Harmony in all, perhaps the schemes of Finnish interior design
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the fairgrounds, as the magnificent views of the Saimaa coastline reach many rooms through the large windows.
At every turn, we see our northern neighbors' efforts to create both rugged and perfect (energy-efficient) homes.
The Finnish skill in using wood as a building and finishing material, in making furniture and jewelry is worthy of admiration and observation.
Both builders and (home) designers can find invigorating techniques and clever solutions in the exhibition halls.
It is evident that combinations of black, white, and gray shades, combined with the tones of wood and houseplants, can be very mood-inducing.
Good ideas can be in the pipeline for another week, because the fair runs through August 13.
The utensils and pottery suggest that this kitchen is a frequent cooking spot.
Tonight, the line was drawn down to the Weekend Festival Baltico, and Martin Garrix was at the top of his game to be remembered as the last performer.
The crowd was really turned up during Garrix's performance - the song, the chorus, the dancing memorable.
When Garrix finished, they were scattered as a mass from the beach to the city.
We're bringing you a gallery of all the photos our photographer took over the weekend.
You must be one of them. Find yourself.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible confrontation.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are expected to be on a collision course to face off in the most exciting boxing match of the near future in the 66.7kg weight class, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked across the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization heavyweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous decision to defeat four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are at the top of the weight table.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck with that".
Lomachenko is defending his belt against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 7pm on ESPN.
When Lomachenko posed for a couple of photos, Egis Klimas, Lomachenko's manager, noted that the possible confrontation between the fighters would be "a perfect balance".
"I'm a former weightlifter", Garcia recalled.
"I moved up for Broner [an additional 63.5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm small at 63.5 kg.
I want to move down the lightweight.
And he's got to move up to the lightweight division, and then we can fight.
The fans have asked for it.
Let's give them this".
Lomachenko has agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight".
Climas raised the question of whether it should be worthwhile to watch, part of his strategy to have Lomachenkol debut in the 61.2 kg class later this year, in order to make it possible for him to face Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's match after their title round at the Forum on 23 September.
"It could be worth watching this fight because the fans have wanted this fight", Garcia said, later saying he's open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We are the main actors.
No other name can get as much attention.
Whenever they're ready"...
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko is a "strong fighter" and might go see his match on Saturday.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia, saying that he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted that knockout".
Garcia said the goal was to show off the punch and then box.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension between them growing into a feud.
"This is a struggle that awaits realization.
No other opposition has attracted so much attention and buzz.
I'm more than willing to work for it", Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It's going to be a good fight".
What parts of the world do people move to Estonia from?
The Police and Border Guard Agency (PPA) has extended and issued a record number of residence permits to over 13,000 third-country nationals who have predominantly travelled to Estonia to work, study or join their families.
For example, last year it was decided to issue temporary residence permits to 6702 foreigners, while in the past it was 4928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis is being prepared at the Ministry of the Interior.
If ten years ago, about 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia each year, in recent years this number is expected to approach 2,000.
The number of persons applying for residence permits increased sharply during the crisis in Ukraine, with 1087 persons receiving temporary residence permits in 2014, compared to 675 the previous year.
According to the Statistical Office, the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing the most in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than left last year.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and because of the difficult conditions in the country, it is natural that people look for work and study opportunities in a country where the community and many families are already ahead", said Kristin Rammus, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Interior.
Mullu and Tunamulu had more Ukrainians granted temporary residence permits than even Russian citizens, although the latter have been granted the most temporary residence permits in ten years.
If Ukrainians are coming here to work, then Russians are coming here for family emigration.
"Given this historic Russian community, they probably also have the largest family ties with people living in Russia", said Helina Maasing, a migrant researcher at the National Defense Academy.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have obtained an Estonian residence permit have settled, then Harjumaa is immediately followed by East Virumaa", he added, noting that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
I have 1696 Russian citizens who have been granted temporary residence permits, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians seeking to extend their residence permits decreased.
"The jump is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for to settle permanently in Estonia", explained Rammus, spokesman for the Ministry of Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived in Estonia for at least three years in the previous year may apply for a new residence permit to settle permanently in Estonia.
The aim is to encourage people who have adapted to stay.
However, a long-term resident's residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The new residence permit has probably reduced the number of renewals of the old residence permit.
For example, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit last year.
Now Ukrainians can change jobs and the Estonian state will no longer keep track of whether the salary criterion is met.
This residence permit has become increasingly popular, with applicants from the gray passport category (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 persons were granted residence permits for the purpose of residing in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and as many Chinese.
By the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In a surprising ten years, Nigeria has become one of the most active countries in Estonia for residence permits.
If in 2007 three residence permits were issued to Nigerians, then 200 were issued.
Nigerians come to these universities.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely due to the educational opportunities.
The rule is that where a community has developed, it is easier for others to join", Rammus added.
In the last ten years, two people have moved to Estonia from North Korea, for example, and as many from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia, and four from Uruguay.
If about 6000 third-country nationals are granted residence permits per year, this is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if we assume more EU citizens, migration will remain around 1 percent", Maasing commented that the numbers are actually small.
According to the Statistical Office, 14,822 people migrated to Estonia this year, while 13,792 left.
That means the second year, the immigration outnumbered the exodus.
Most of the newcomers are Estonian nationals, but there are more of them among the departing.
As a result, the number of Estonian nationals on the move was down by 2000 people this year.
Estonians migrate mainly between Finland and Estonia.
The princess style of Mammu Couture charms with saws, stitches and twigs

The sculptor does not distinguish between the bright events and the grey day.
It was this thought process that gave rise to the plan to bring high fashion in Estonia to the countryside, between forests and fields, to people, whom fashion often does not reach.
Mam's collection was presented in Vroos, J√µhvis and P√§rnu fashion hall, where a royal parade of 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, people often pose, nod with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - they shout "bravo", stand up, want to shake your hand to thank you.
Most of the audience came to do the news, but now they're fans of Mammu Couture.
When you exceed people's expectations, they're thrilled!
And I like the feeling of being on a summer trip with my mood.
In the tower we had a 50 meter long red carpet, the whole street was full of beautiful dresses, it seemed like there was no end to them!
Maria also does not admit that the creation must be presented by a supermodel supermodel, she is happy to bring on stage ordinary women.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they have always been happy to come.
It's such a great experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry I've never seen my own show, because I'm always backstage, like a desperate perfectionist, giving things the last of my time.
My nerves won't let me look at the hall in peace.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who doesn't just want to be representative, she wants to be in everything.
I have my sewing machine in the studio, so I do most of the sewing myself.
I love the whole process of you playing with the details, discovering.
I'm never far from my creations and I'm not afraid of work.
It's not just the design, it's the styling, the logistics, the planning, the organization, it's all about the day for one temperamental woman.
I'm sure those hours are a lot for fanatics.
I can't even tell when my workday is over, it's just a day of joy for me!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an endless chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, the person gets something beautiful and then compliments.
I've been told many times that my dresses are magical. They make me feel like a princess.
The lavish line of fabrics that made Maria's talent famous overnight has remained the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin M√º√ºrsepp of the U18 boys: the Estonian undergroup tournament weapon has now turned against us
Too bad the fairy tale is over.
First thing I noticed was we couldn't get our table.
And when there's such a big gap on the table, there's nothing to do", commented on the 61:75 loss to Great Britain by the Estonian U18 basketball team, our only NBA basketball player, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin M√º√ºrsepp.
The opponents took 28 balls off the board and got so many more strikes because of it.
We weren't ready for their aggressive defense or attack, either, it hit.
Many British attacks were stopped in three to five seconds, we couldn't build a defense.
But on defense, they could hold hands everywhere, we couldn't match.
It's what's been screwing the team up.
The other students had done their homework better.
In the opinion of M√º√ºrsepa, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes to reduce the opposition's momentum.
In the last quarter, we had zero errors, but the opponents had already gotten several quick baskets.
The athleticism and tight headedness that were our weapons in the sub-group tournament now turned against us.
Today, we were powerless against their aggression.
The bricklayer was at peace with his ward, Caleb, Matthias Tasis.
In the tournament, you can generally say good things about the whole team, but until today, there was one major scandal.
It's a pity you've never met an opponent so aggressive before.
The cup has always been confident and played its own game, but it seemed to be tired - it has been carrying a rather heavy load.
But he did some of the most beautiful moves I've ever seen in training", the instructor added.
Terrible numbers: The girls' basketball team scored less than 10 points in three quarters at the World Cup...
The U18 age group is not only the boys' EMI B-division basketball tournament in Tallinn, the girls started the summer in Dublin.
And Estonia's game against Poland, unfortunately, fell into the anti-record area.
Estonia lost 25:65, but even after the third quarter, the time was 9:49 or only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took the foot off the gas pedal and the period was left to 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4 points, 1 point in the third...
The Estonians hit two of the first four shots in the first two minutes, then 25 shots out of the game, then one in the third, then another 21 shots out...
Maybe in the next half hour, one of the 47 was caught.
Plus, he got two points in four free throws.
Ball-shooting was a reasonable number at the time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland had a 33 percent and Estonia a 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia have started with two losses, opening day had to admit Portugal's 83:56 lead.
NATO ships have arrived in Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO's Permanent Mine Action Group 1 arrived in Tallinn for the weekend for a planned port visit to replenish the ships' supplies and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships make preparations for their return to sea, allowing the crew members to rest for a few days.
Following the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to conduct a series of exercises and to prepare for future historic bomb-finding operations.
"The Estonians' participation in the NATO unit and the joint exercises they are conducting in local waters show well our integration with the Allied forces", said Major-General Arto Reinmaa, the senior commander of the Naval Fleet Commander's Operations and Planning Division.
As of 29 June, NATO 1st Permanent Mine Action Group is commanded by Latvian Marine Lieutenant-Colonel Gvido Laudups, who took over the duties of Group Commander from Estonian Marine Officer Lieutenant-Colonel Johan-Elias Seljam√§e at a ceremony in Riga.
The flagship of the group is the support ship of the Latvian Navy LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates the group's command post.
This semester, the international unit also includes the Estonian Navy's minesweeper Sakala.
One of the four ships under NATO Maritime Command, NATO Permanent Mine Action Group 1 is a rapid reaction readiness unit that can be deployed by the Alliance to various locations around the world within five days.
From August 4 to 13, the ancient ruins of the Pirita Monastery will once again be the site of the Birgitta Festival, initiated 13 years ago by Maestro Eri Klass.
According to Risto Joost, artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic, the Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The audience will be reached by the opera world's classics "Traviata" and "Tosca", the ballet adaptations of the captivating "Boleros" and the entertaining "Karlsson", as well as the production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorio "The Yearlings" by the same international creative team that brought Haydn's second masterpiece, "Creation", to the Pirita stage in 2015.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatrical performances.
It's bigger than any musical theater in its usual form.
It's a festival that takes over and never really unleashes.
Because the experience that the listener gets in this upper and mysterious environment, it makes the human soul ring and touches the human senses in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't Maestro Erick's shoes seem a little big to you?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with the Special Class, it's been a great help.
He guided me through my entire student career and also supported me in my early conducting career.
Maybe that's what makes it easier for me to continue his work.
Erika Klas has infused so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and of course it's all transferred to me.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things work.
It was the big heart of Erik Klass that gave me the strength to go on with the Birgitta Festival at the Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What would excite the audience at this year's festival, what special offer do you have?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania, and, surprisingly, the first ballet to be staged at the museum, written on a story by Astrid Lindgren.
That's what "Karlsson Flies" is for.
And one curious nuance about this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this piece.
He must have had the Carlson character in him since he was a child.
Risto, how are you doing all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner, I'm sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have plenty of that.
And I've found that my personal emotions don't depend as much on other people as they do on myself or how I deal with each new day.
And this kind of conscious tone, this kind of positivity, and actually smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning, significantly increased my happiness rate.
Especially this week, when it's the most important rehearsal, I've been practicing it especially diligently, and it's working.
Smiling at yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a word.
I don't think people know half the things about their bodies that the universe has to offer, but I think we're all going to find out.
Right now, we're in the middle of a big moment.
Do you have any ritual before the conductor steps on the podium?
Yes, I do. I need to change clothes for something more comfortable.
It's this little moment to yourself.
But, yeah, I don't get a chance to rest or take a nap before my big gig.
In fact, I like to actively interact with people, even before I step on the conductor's chair.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, there's something to discover for a not-so-great friend of opera and ballet!
Watch the hilarious video with Risto Joost!
New results of age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers released
In Sweden, a test was conducted on asylum seekers to assess their age using a novel medical approach. The latest results show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed as being older than 18, but not all believe the results are accurate.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (R√§ttsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
The tests were created to assess the age of asylum seekers after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of several allegedly underage refugees.
The Migrationsverket has so far sent 6880 cases for testing and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as being 18 years of age or older, and in a further 25 cases the Institute of Forensic Medicine assessed the test subject as "may be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the person was determined to be 'likely to be under 18'.
Tests are only used if the age of the person is under question mark.
According to Johan G√∂ransson, of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
"We don't see a big difference from the statistics of the previous months, the numbers are pretty consistent", he told The Local newspaper.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were assessed as being older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The institute released the results of 581 tests in May, saying that 442 of them "indicated that the person under study was 18 years of age or older".
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 of them, the person had directly stated that he would be 18 this year.
This method of medical ageing, in which wisdom teeth are X-rayed and knee muscles are MRIed and then examined by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some quarters.
One skeptic is Karolinska Institutet endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they passed through puberty earlier or later than normal.
"I've had reason to think about it, and I don't think the current measurement method should be used.
Determining biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can", he told Metro.
But Johan G√∂ransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, the risk of misdiagnosing a child as an adult is low.
The highest risk, maybe about 10%, is if the person is a little under 18".

20-year-old handball player Anna Maria Orel made her debut at the World Championships in London, finishing in a beautiful 18th place with a time of 67.37.
Orel was the youngest female archer in the M.M.A., and a cheerful woman confirmed that she hoped to fight for medals in the future.
The race went well, and I had a good experience.
In the first attempt (64.80), I immediately made my average score, in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I managed to keep my head clear", said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my shot, and I'm so glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's M.M. debut ended with a perfect 18th.
The rain didn't bother O'Reill, because he's training at the TTC Stadium for the winter.
"I'm hard", he said with a slight twinge.
With the London Olympic Stadium almost packed, did Orel sense the people around him or did he shut himself off?
I did, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it adds to the mix, and it does!
You can experience it if you compete.
Orel confirmed that he will be at peace with his MMi debut and that he will have many more good races ahead of him: "I came here with the 32nd or last result of this season, finishing in 18th place.
That's a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and the World Cup is all that matters.
I'm bringing in some good experience, and I want to compete for medals one day.
The governor of West Virginia announced a party change.
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night, in a meeting with President Trump, that he's switching parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me", said Governor Justice.
"Today, after much prayer and thought, I tell you... "today, I tell you, West Virginians, "that I can no longer serve you as Democratic governor".
There was a great outpouring of joy at the gathering.
"So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow", Justice added.
"As coach, I'd say it's time to play another game".
Trump had promised a big announcement earlier at the West Virginia rally.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, turned out to be the winner in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited the coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement Thursday night that "Gov. Justice's party change is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather prevent the country from being better than work for it".
"Of the 15 governorships and control of the lowest number of states in history, Governor Justice's announcement is simply the latest in a long line of rejections to a party that is completely out of control and unable to find a positive and unifying message", RNC representative Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
It's no surprise that where there's a lot of people, there's a lot of people who get hurt.
The weekend medical officer, Urmet, told the Evening Post yesterday that they've had to hand out a lot of patches.
The bumps and bruises are the basic, the twists and the slight falls.
Headaches, back and legs, of course.
Urmet says that the guests come to the festival with the wrong shoes and that's how problems come.
The paramedics have also had to assist a few visitors with major injuries - there have been a few panic attacks and a broken leg.
We have also made stitches for people who have broken their hands or fingers.
We do the smaller stitches here, send the bigger ones to the hospital.
Check the video to see if the party doctors are asking for a painkiller for the measles.
Coe praised the Russians' honest apology for the doping scandal.
International athlete Sebastian Coe hailed what he called "Russia's sincere apology Thursday" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now was not the time to allow the country back into the sport.
Russian athlete Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships that his country's ban on competition was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all the athletes who have been stripped of their gold and silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to keep the ban in place, which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think today was a very honest response, a very honest presentation", IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole council and the whole congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself has acknowledged that it has been through some difficult times and is doing everything possible to reorganize the Federation".
Coe also said that he was pleased that Russia had accepted its own recovery criteria.
"I think today was a very constructive day and there's progress, but Congress supports the task force's proposal that now is not the right time to take back Russia", Coe said.
"We must do everything we can over the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from a corrupt system,' he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF, will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday.
IAAF task force leader Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia had not yet met several of the criteria for recovery.
After his presentation to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping controls were still inadequate and the banned trainers were still free to operate.
The electric car revolution is fundamentally changing the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only will the electric car revolution fundamentally change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say they win one place and lose another, smaller mining companies can't help it.
Glencore currently makes its money from coal and oil, but in the future, in the era of electric cars, demand will grow for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel.
This year, the efforts to increase the use of electric cars have been bolstered by the decisions of the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
Volvo has already announced that it plans to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will launch the cheaper Model 3 electric car.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that electric cars will outsell petrol-powered cars within two decades.
"For some metals, this is a game changer", Simona Gambranini, a commodity analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We've already seen a big impact on metals like lead and lithium, which have been in demand for years.
Electric cars contain about three times as much copper as a conventional car, Glencore reported.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the compatibility of the measures in question.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means an additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will benefit from the growing trend of electric cars, the rise in copper prices and the fact that it is the world's largest cobalt producer, the Jefferies Group forecast.
According to this brokerage, the other winners in the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to the changing trend.
The London Metals Exchange has fallen by a whopping 70% this year.
The bullish price increase was 37 percent.
Copper has also risen 14 percent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's stock in London rose by 20 percent, having outpaced rivals the Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American in terms of price increases.
On the losing side are lead companies like Recyclex and Campine, which have to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of lead is batteries that power petrol and diesel car starters.
Electric cars use lithium displays.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is used for other purposes to overcome the decline in demand", said Michael Widmer, head of metal market analysis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The effect of the unfolding trend in the face of the price movement is not yet apparent.
Lead has risen 17 percent this year, making it the most expensive of London's major industrial metals.
Investors don't see the metal's problems until much later.
"I'm not sure it's that bad for lead, because cheap oil keeps cars competitive", said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at Triland Metals, a metal dealer.
When the demand for lead drops, it's going to be slow.
It could be like this in about ten years.
Meanwhile, stricter emissions standards mean that demand for hybrid cars, which rely on advanced lead-based batteries for frequent engine starts, is increasing, estimates the International Lead and Zinc Research Organisation.
Light metals like aluminum are replacing steel because a lighter car can travel longer distances with less electricity.
This explains the additional minimum demand for aluminium of 1,6 million tonnes already from 2013 to 2016.
This represents 2.7 percent of the world's total aluminium production.
This trend is likely to worsen, Widmer said.
Aluminum has risen 13 percent this year as growing demand from automakers has led to a market deficit.
Steel manufacturers are not sleeping.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce micro-cells for cars.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also seeking to develop a lighter alloy of steel to withstand the aluminium limit.
"Super-strength steel should be the answer to this development", said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
There's been some success in Europe.
The end of the oil age could also bring suffering to the platinum.
About half of that precious metal was used in the catalytic converters of diesel-powered cars, reported Johnson Matthey, a metal refiner.
"Many commodities that are in high demand today, such as oil and platinum, may not be in high demand in the future", said Bernard Dahdah, a commodity analyst at Naxalite.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change in 15 years.
Platinum producers believe that demand for diesel hybrid cars will continue.
Marc Grynberg, head of Uncore, said that in 2025 hybrid cars will continue to sell more than fully electric cars.
The big hope for platinum producers in the next 10 years is hydrogen-based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motors, which rely on platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
However, this technology has not yet proved itself commercially viable.
"Diesel seems to be clearly on the losing path towards electric cars", said Exane Brunet of BNP Paribas.
German carmakers suffered a major setback in July when a court in Stuttgart banned the use of diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche in their home city.
How football's financial regulations affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the uncontrolled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from making a world-record move from Spanish club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Whatever consequences come from UEFA, the governing body of European football, which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League, Paris Saint-Germain will have to face.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid to the Region.
Barcelona were paid ‚Ç¨222 million ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar's salary will be in the tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to the French club.
PSG can undoubtedly spend this kind of money to recruit Neymar and add him to their star-studded lineup, given that the team is funded by the ruling family of the Qatari energy mafia.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money recruiting players, but they must balance this with legal sources of income that allow them to make a living in football.
FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that fell into debt in search of success were in fact engaged in fraud and risked bankruptcy if the banks or owners were to withdraw their support.
Since 2011, FFP has focused on monitoring club losses rather than debts.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then spending heavily to improve the team and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
The Commission notes that the aid is not compatible with the internal market.
And despite Platini's disgraceful ouster as president in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will no doubt continue to strengthen these rules", Andrea Traverso, UEFA's FFP supervisor, told The Associated Press last week.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid to the Region under the 2005 Aviation Guidelines.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, which means that the annual transfer fee for the next five years can be shown at EUR 44,4 million.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, together with Abu Dhabi-based Manchester City, were the most severely punished.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
UEFA is looking for clubs that may attempt to circumvent the financial regulatory authorities by claiming their income through companies affiliated with club owners.
A Qatari company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as official income.
The Commission notes that the aid granted to the airport was not granted to the airport operator.
It has been suggested that some of Neymar's services to PSG may come through payments from Qatar to the organising committee for the 2022 World Cup.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could be a World Cup winner, and argue that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a maneuver.
The previous penalties imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant about any attempts to circumvent the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed Neymar's transfer with PSG in advance.
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that their anonymity be guaranteed, as they are not allowed to discuss the situation at PSG.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid to the Region.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a positive impact on sponsorship deals, marketing and shirt sales.
The club expects a turnover increase of at least 30% in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly angered by the departure of one of the biggest football clubs, tried to prevent Neymar's transfer, claiming that PSG was violating the FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the country", La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG is mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is one of the American sports giants, shares La Liga's view that the state finances the club.
"This is a consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the whole football scene over the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the club is owned by the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of a fair game, because the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a great player as the state".

50 years ago today, a hurricane-sized storm in Estonia tore roofs and windows off houses.
The storm, dubbed the "storm of the century", caused extensive damage on August 6 and 7 in the West Country, Hargeisa and Rapalama.
In the north-west of Estonia, wind speeds exceeded 30 m/s during these days.
My old man ran from one tree to another in the garden, trying to support them with his hands.
It was dark and it was like the end of the world.
In Taam, roofs were already flying from houses, as elderly Linda Kurova from Haapsalus recalled in an interview with the magazine Eesti Loodus in 2002.
Linda's husband saw his garden collapse.
But why do you stick your hands up against a tree in a storm like this?
The sea came under the window, water splashed in through the windows", said Mrs. Linda Tona, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalus.
Like most teenagers, Linda did not see the roads covered with trees and the roof of the railway station parron 20 to 30 feet away until the next morning.
Locals said that behind Paralepa, the trees were in a ditch, some completely flat, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm raging through the beautiful old trees like a war.
Western Virumaa was not particularly affected by the August 1967 storm compared with Western Estonia, but the damage was also great, Virumaa Teataja reported in 2007.
The Haapsalu Lossi Park and Padise Park were cleared of land, but our bamboo parks also suffered greatly.
In Tallinn, wind speeds of up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour, were measured.
On the evening of August 6, a little girl in the seaside town of Tallinn cried out: "Mommy, mommy!
The bird is in the air and can't come down!" wrote the Virumaa Teataja.
The farmhouse at P√µlli Manor was so badly damaged by the storm that it was later decided to demolish it.
The structures of the Tyre ski jump did not withstand the August Storm, and they were later abandoned.
The newspaper The Red Star of August 12, 1967, reported that the clearing of fallen trees and branches in cities and towns is progressing slowly, and residents could join in the clearing work.
The storm also hit the crops hard, and the newspaper reported that "party organizations must be the motivators and the guides in both the repair and the harvest".
Hurricanes can be described as having average wind speeds of over 32.7 m/s.
The record for the highest winds in Estonia is from November 2, 1969, when the wind speed was measured at 48 m/s in Ruhn.
The gauge on Vaindloo Island broke, so the speed of the strong winds measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret to clean pools: nighttime cleaning and bad beach weather
The colder summer weather also means less cleaning effort on the swimming pools of Tallinn.
"When it's raining, people are on the beach, and when it's not, there are no people", says a beach cleaner.
Kayaks roaring on the beach of Str√∂m in northern Tallinn.
They are given a melodic competition by a tractor that is swerving at low turns and tripping over the beach.
In fact, the latter sifts through the sand seven centimeters [7.5 inches] deep, picking up seawater and human waste: bottle caps, cigarette buttons, and so forth.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If the weather is nice, people are on the beach, and if not, there are no people", says Aleksandr Usov, head of the Haaberst Coast Authority.
It's 6:30 and the beach is a lot of cleanup, because by 8:00 the place has to be cleaned for people.
Faith is at work at 4:00.
Besides Stroom, he's got eyes on Pirita, Lake Hark, KakumƒÅtai and the beaches of the Bare Island.
The amount of waste has decreased.
Years ago, it was much more.
People are already appreciating what is done for them", says Usov, who has been cleaning the beach for 15 years.
It used to be that when something new was put up, it was broken the next day.
They're already holding what's on the beach.
Price of clean beach
One of the major jobs on the Estonian beaches is cleaning up the sea litter that washes up on the shore.
For example, on Pirita Beach, 400 000 tonnes will have to be hauled off this beach season.
"It is an incredible amount", notes Faith.
The second major category is garbage, or anything left behind by humans.
On the one-and-a-half-mile stretch of beach at Stroom, there are eight large garbage bins that need to be emptied three times a week.
So much waste.
However, colder summers have meant that there is one fifth less waste than otherwise.
The third category is the things that are left behind.
Mostly they're children's toys.
As a catch this time, Usov has dug out a dozen model cars from the sand.
They'll be waiting for their owners on the beach.
"Usually more come out, but this is normal catch". The believer already knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
The children come to the beach and pick up the toys to dip them back into the sand.
The garbage is disposed of
Erika Scholler, representative of the Haabert administrative services, admits that the tractor screening work is disturbing to the locals.
The noise, which lasts from late at night until dawn, disrupts the sleep of the people living in the neighborhood.
It's impossible to do that during the day.
You have to search the beach twice in one month.
"If we don't, the city will fine us", Scholler notes.
But, like Pirita, Pikakari and P√§rnu, the aim is to get the international Blue Flag for Stroom Beach.
"Compared with Europe, Estonia has a lot more work to do to maintain its beaches", says Scholler.
We have more ash and stones and harder sand to sand.
But our beaches are less garbage than anywhere else in Europe.
Hearing about the beach's garbage, Martin, who lives near Stroom Beach, unwillingly joins a conversation with reporters and cleaners, highlighting the current bottlenecks of the beach.
There's a horrible picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with the birds and bottle-repairers who have been pulling the trash bags up the drain", reports Martin.
While it is difficult to assume that people will be able to change their current behaviour, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about the garbage cans, for example by putting covers on them, to prevent at least the birds from wandering around.
But overall, Martin is pleased with the development of Stroom Beach.
It's clear the city's taking care of it.
With children's walks, lighted and freshly paved roads, it has become more pleasant.
"There was a time when scooters could only go one way", notes Martin.
The treasure hunter's find in Stroomis: coins, only coins
The morning's warm weather has been taken advantage of by 40-year-old Dimitri, who is a treasure hunter scouring the coast with a metal detector.
He doesn't believe he'll find anything of value today or in the future.
The Sea Gods are not generous enough.
"I've been doing this for a year and I haven't found anything worthwhile", reports Dmitri.
As a hobbyist, Dmitri's treasure chest contains some euro coins, bottle baskets, and even dangerous coins, which he later throws in the trash.
Usually there's coins.
"Gold, rings and the like are not usually available", says the treasure hunter.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0,25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates will remain at their normal levels as weak economic growth and the easing of inflation have softened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that growth will remain sluggish as flat household incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policy makers voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25% and fewer members are calling for a rise this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1,7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1,6% and warned that the pressure on household incomes would remain as inflation was still expected to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
The Bank also noted that the increase in rates is necessary to contain Brexit inflation over the next few years and that a higher than expected increase in borrowing costs may be necessary on financial markets.
Members also voted a year ago in favour of partial withdrawal of the market economy mammoth package launched in the wake of Brexit.
The Bank will end its fixed-term financing scheme in February, which provides banks with cheap financing, although it said that it now expects a ¬£15 billion higher offer of ¬£115 billion under the scheme.
In the minutes of the rate decision, the Bank states: 'The MPC forecasts that gross domestic product (GDP) will remain weak in the near future, as the difficult situation of household real incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption'.
As regards the amounts, it was reiterated that the mitigation of inflation requires "some tightening of monetary policy" and "much more" than the markets expected.
The stock exchange is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a second increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any jumps are gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and the following year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1,9% and 1,7%.
The Commission also notes that the Union industry is still in a difficult situation.
After the news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures which have eclipsed growing expectations for growth - GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will pick up some momentum towards the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice to households suffering from soaring inflation and a miserable wage rise, saying that things would get a little worse before they got better.
It added that monetary policy could not prevent a hit to incomes over the next few years, but that wage growth was expected to pick up significantly by the end of the three-year forecast.
The weak pound is also fuelling the economy by increasing demand for British production, which partially compensates for lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the rate was raised to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU referendum, which caused the pound to weaken abruptly.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for prices and the economy to fully come back to life.
Prior to the Bank's latest decision, there was growing demand for a rate increase as inflation had increased the pressure on tight households; in July, three policymakers called for a rate increase to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared with 2.9% in June, although the Bank said it was expected and expected to rise again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excessive growth compared to the 2% target was entirely due to the weakness of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, Head of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: 'Given the recent fall in interest rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive again as lenders are eager to work and expect to end the year on a positive note.
The stock market seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are about to close, as refinancing, often free of charge and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular.'
The NHS is prescribing controversial HIV drugs to 10,000 people.
Patients have had access to 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment since September following a Supreme Court battle over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England announced that the NHS is now making available to an estimated 10,000 people during an initial three-year clinical trial a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection by around 86% in high-risk people.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS is able to pay for PrEP, despite the NHS's own claims that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, welcomed the move announced on Thursday as a "new major intervention", while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "turning point".
Sex-related clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics to join in October before the programme is rolled out across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Clinical trial results show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that the human body has sufficient amounts of certain medicines to prevent HIV infection.
These medicines may be taken every day or at least two hours before intercourse.
Suitable candidates include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-infected and are not receiving treatment.
Clinics will identify suitable people who are willing to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-positive partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People living in England who have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate at the local sex-related clinic participating in the programme.
The programme costs ¬£10 million and NHS England has signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week after an international procurement procedure.
The aim of the clinical trial is to assess the true potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on who the drug is intended for and how it is consumed and applied on a larger scale.
Stevens said: "This new broad intervention should complement and intensify the wider and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of fighting one of mankind's greatest health problems".
Deborah Gold, executive director of NAT, said: "This is a watershed moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted to those who need it and are at risk, offers the potential to change the HIV epidemic in England.
From September, people at high risk of HIV in England will have access to a powerful new tool through this NHS-funded clinical trial that is individually manageable and does not depend on negotiations with a partner, improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement".
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The priority now is to ensure that the clinical trial is launched quickly across the country and that no HIV risk group is left behind.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug is available, we're on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.
The Acting Minister for Health Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the clinical trial of PrEP is very welcome and very late after months of delays and government drag.
The evidence shows how much this medicine can change in HIV prevention and in stopping the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial brings us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is rolled out nationwide as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society".
The price of electricity rose by 12% in Estonia, but fell in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference in the next day's electricity price between the Estonian and Latvian and Lithuanian price areas decreased to EUR 1.94, compared with EUR 7.71 in June of this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price difference is the breaches of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average stock market price for electricity last month was EUR 34.33 per megawatt-hour and the price rose by 12 percent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by 5% to EUR 36,27 megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34,17 and the price of the Nord Pool system was EUR 26,37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12% and 7% respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, 75 percent of the electricity was delivered to Estonia and 16 percent from Estonia to Finland during the previous month.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries were without transactions the next day.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity was transported from Estonia to Latvia 99 percent of the time and 73 percent of the time was at full transmission capacity.
According to the transactions on the Nasdaq OMX market on the last trading day of July, the market price for electricity may be around EUR 34 per megawatt-hour in August and EUR 37 per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of CO2 affecting the electricity industry increased last month and the transactions were carried out at prices ranging from EUR 5,04 to EUR 5,47 per tonne.
The high-rise apartment, with its half-storey and clever design, has transformed this tiny Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate developer, traded her grand Knightsbridge home for an Earls Court condo in 2014.
It's on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and resold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my former roommate in Knightsbridge on a much larger plot of land", Joanne said.
"I found something that would be equivalent to my offer.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment, and it had the same tall shelves.
I fell in love with it and I proposed the same day".
Since the first visit, the 93-square-meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Originally a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout, Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half-story to take advantage of the high stairs.
"I wanted tall windows, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands", he said.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Notting Hill architectural and design firm Duck & Shed to take advantage of the 12-foot-high (3.8 m) glass sheds and create a home that would not be just a development, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half-story where you could stand upright.
Erfan had to be creative.
"The metal structure is quite complex", he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they would be placed on top of each other without having to bow.
It was not just a platform, but a steel structure to make sure that both the upper and lower chambers were at the right height".
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms in a room, one after the other, with many dramatic elements.
The half-floor opens to a glamorous living room with a view from the Retrouvius window with its ancient copper light.
The mirrored gold furniture, silver details and the retro lighting by Serge Mouille emphasize the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, spaciousness and light saturation.
Mirrors have been added to both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored back wall gives the impression of a window opening onto the other room.
There's a mirror cabinet in the lobby that provides storage for all of Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
Adding to the charm of the living room is the possibility of closing the kitchen when it's not being used, creating a more glamorous room of imagination.
Collapsible kitchens are not new.
What is unique about this kitchen is that it is a garage-style retractable door.
"It was a bit of a design effort", explains Erfan's steel-reinforced MDF door.
"It has a counterweight, so it floats very easily when you push it up".
By using space and storage wisely, Joanne now has an additional 50 square feet [16 sq m], an additional bedroom, and a better apartment plan.
"At the end of the day, it's the floor area that you sell - or what gives the property value", says Erfan.
"A real estate agent walks into a room in an outdated form and makes calculations based on the floor area".
Here they have been able to increase the floor area by using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"It's the materials you touch that help you to form an emotional bond with home", says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with a wire on a wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make your heart ring".
It shows that good design and increased floor space can help make a rather ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may even make you want to stay, as Joanne did.
Dane Jensen is a Chicago skyscraper bounty hunter who is competing with a colleague for a promotion.
All that matters is the amount of money you make, and then you forget all about ethics.
A man only sees his wife and three children early in the morning and late at night.
In the first half of the movie, I'm caught thinking that this is a "House of Cards" version of the business world -- even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler have a similar tone.
But the more the film progresses, the less the film element remains, and the more the filmmakers' moralising intent becomes apparent.
The life-changing experience for the main character is when his son gets cancer.
Now we have to choose between work and family.
A son who dreams of an architectural firm makes his father think about the things that really matter... like faith, kindness, love... even the Twin Towers disaster.
After the third scene, when the son opens his father's eyes, it seems that the filmmakers have set out to make sure that the audience will cry, for even the most eager viewer cannot hold back his tears at the sight of the suffering of the beloved cancer-stricken boy.
When the son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, the father finally realizes the morality of his work and does a charity work for the old man in need.
Now, I'm betting myself that if the movie is happy, I'll reward my insight with a cup of coffee after the movie, but if I'm wrong, the writer can be credited with at least one surprise.
For a moment, I wonder if I'll miss the coffee when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and he rushes down the hallway to the palace in a slow-moving car.
The son has made a miraculous recovery, and even though his father has just lost his job, that is a positive sign, since he now has time to care for his family.
I can feel good too - I can predict the end of American drama quite well!
To give it a proper credit, the film is well-constructed, with all the necessary elements.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the morals are beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I think this movie's gonna be a good one.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to restrict the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do that.
Then he'd be the first.
Politico reports that the White House's new chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information, including news, to President Trump in the hope that it will keep the chief on the same page.
This is our reporter Josh Dawsey.
"When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with senior officials on his first day in office, he brought up the key problem President Donald Trump had in the White House that he planned to solve -- getting bad information into the hands of the president.
Kelly told officials that information must flow through him, whether on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he were given good information".
The Kelly diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by tracking his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television dates back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habits have not gone away.
"When candidate Trump was angry about dishonest media coverage, it paid to show him that he was also being portrayed honestly in influential publications", former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "six former campaign staffers say the key to controlling Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption consistently includes a hymn".
- I'll take it from here.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits have ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaigners know something the rest of us don't, that Trump's flares would have been even more incendiary without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about the messages that Trump didn't post.
If his aides were able to get him out of trouble one or two times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from continuing to stir up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House of competing cliques, people are exclusively trying to advance their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be credible.
Politico, which covered the whole story, wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to feed the president information of strategic value.
One example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is this:
"Present and former Trump aides say Trump may react to negative press, especially damaging information, with an explosive, obsessive focus on identifying its source.
So, in late February, someone gave the president a printed copy of an article on GotNews.com, a website owned by Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being a "source of multiple information" to the White House.
It doesn't matter if Johnson is permanently blocked from Twitter because of bullying or if he didn't provide any concrete evidence or if he made false accusations in the past and retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking his subordinates about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Chief of Staff Rob Porter "have been trying to establish a system to manage and document the documents that reach Trump".
How did you do that?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same thing.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his aides are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad in the capital are not allowed to perform.
There are many foreigners in the center of Tallinn.
Those the paper spoke to confessed to playing in the Old City without a permit from the city.
The first thing we found near the gates of the Viru were three street musicians who had brought as many dogs with them.
It was clear that the musicians in the Rasta suits and the explosive clothes were backpackers who could use a shower berry.
Despite her appearance, the only woman in the company played the accordion to a fun rhythm, while a man next to her was juggling three balls and inviting passersby closer.
The third man sat next to them in a backpack and smoked a self-contained cigarette.
The three dogs did not allow the passing crowd to disturb them.
Noemi, who played the accordion, and Bob, who juggled the balls, said they danced in the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the company's performance was to raise money for a boat that would sail to Finland that evening.
Asked if they had asked the city for permission to make music in the old town, they shook their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Second, we never stay in one city more than a day or two, and most of the time they give us permits for a month or so.
There's no point in paying for it", Bob explained.
About 20 minutes later, when we came back to the gates of the Viru, we saw two women with the musicians, driving them away.
The company moved to the intersection of the Viru Center with backpacks and dogs to touch luck.
Three young Polish men also performed in Viru Street, one playing the violin, another the clarinet, and the third had brought along a complete electronic piano.
"We are here to entertain people, to spread music and joy, and to earn money for fuel and living", explained piano trio member Mivosh.
Mivoshi says they're aware that they need city permits to perform.
"Of course we don't have it", he joked.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we'll go elsewhere, but we have to try", he added.
In July, the Bank of Estonia purchased bonds for EUR 149 million under the public sector purchase programme of the euro area central banks, increasing its total bond portfolio to EUR 4.36 billion.
The ECB does not publish any more detailed information on purchases.
In response to a previous request from members of the Estonian Parliament, the President of the Bank of Estonia, Hardo Hansson, explained that the Eurosystem central bank asset purchase plan comprises three different purchase programmes: covered bonds, asset-backed securities (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest their money elsewhere.
The effect of the purchases is to reduce the yield on the lower risk assets and to motivate investors to take higher risks.
In general, each central bank buys its own government bonds under the PPP, no bonds are bought from other countries.
Since the Estonian State has not issued the bonds, Eesti Pank will make replacement purchases within the allocated volume.
Replacement transactions are also made by central banks in countries where the supply of bonds under the purchase plan is limited.
The Bank's activities are mainly structured around the purchase of bonds from European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank, with Hansson's approval.
The Bank has been buying bonds under the Asset Purchase Programme since March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering bonds were also acquired, but since June 2016 Eesti Pank no longer buys Elering bonds.
As of June, the Central Bank of Finland will buy both the Elering and the Eesti Energia bonds on behalf of the euro area central banks.
Travelers ignore the grave and return to "the district of millionaires"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have once again found themselves in a fierce confrontation with determined trekkers who have ignored the council's trench to win back the land away from their villas.
The tourists have parked their 20 trailer villas in the open fields near the affluent "millionaire's district" of Solihull Street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after being driven out of the corn, uninhibited by the trench dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical team found a weak spot in the defence line, pushing their vehicles through the unobstructed part that had been left to walk.
Maruvihas residents have denounced the Solhull City Council, saying the council is "useless in dealing with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved in on Monday night after being evicted from Bentley Heath, where they threw rocks at passersby.
The council must be shamed into action, because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The Wanderers were there before, they were driven away, and now they're back again.
They came in last night, probably more today".
He added: "Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with this sort of thing by getting long fences to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I'm not happy about having to keep paying the city tax when the city can't even stop that".
A local resident, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last of these pilgrims leave, and there's already another raid.
This time the numbers have increased and even the horse has been seen in the grass".
A spokesman for the City of Solihull said: 'We are aware that the countryside near Streetsbrook Road is an unacceptable camping site and we are working with the police in Solihull to take the necessary legal measures to get them out of the area as quickly as possible.
It is a great help in gathering evidence if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
It helps to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them".
The weekend festival will be attended by Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is delighted that the real world names have been brought to Estonia.
To the question why the Weekend Festival is so important for Estonians, Saar replies that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the three days of the festival to the fullest.
But he proves that the real experts in their field have come to P√§rn√§s.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been able to bring to Estonia, bringing home the absolute top names of this musical genre - this often does not happen in our country", says the Minister of Culture.
What artists at the festival do the Island talk about the most?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old men like me, one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who came on stage last night.
"I'm not sure what the answer is", she says.
But he's gonna bring out a lot of other names, like Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian producers too: starting with NO√ãP and you can count them all.
In fact, the concentration of familiar names is very large", he says.

Audi to upgrade up to 850,000 diesel vehicles amid a crisis in carmakers
The day before Audi announced the deal, BMW said it would offer software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the chairman of BMW, the company believes that 'there are smarter options than driving restrictions', referring to European cities, including BMW's home city of Munich, which have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
None of the companies described these operations as recalls.
European carmakers have been promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
But nitrogen oxide from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment to neutralize the exhaust emissions of diesel vehicles will also increase for the car industry, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German carmakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of coddling powerful carmakers and ignoring signs of trouble.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which has been silent about the use of so-called fraudulent devices that allowed the emission sample to be adjusted to the regulations during the test of the car, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics division of Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany, when authorities accused Audit of installing the system to circumvent European emission standards, thus extending an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be a big draw for Volkswagen - the luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The cost of the EU flags for Estonian schools is ‚Ç¨20,000.
The Ministry of Education plans to buy European Union flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
The total of 570 educational institutions flying the flag of the European Union is 105x158 centimetres.
The flags are intended for indoor display, and must be printed in high-quality printing technology indoors, including with tunnel mounting, the ERR news portal said.
The banner reads: 'Gifts to Estonian schools to mark the first Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is 20,000 euros, or 35 euros per flag, at the Ministry of Education's price.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing danger in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review plans to cover the latest chaos in Sinaloa State, which is being sown by organized crime, corrupt officials, and unstoppable drug wars.
But today they have gathered under the shadow of personal tragedy to discuss their safety.
They are told that it is important to change their routine.
Two parent journalists are debating which seems safer: bringing the children to the office, which was the target of a shell attack in 2009, or leaving them at home.
The security experts have written three words on the sign in front of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They ask reporters to provide names in every column. No evidence, just impressions and gut feelings.
Suspected of being government or cartel employees are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists - a whole list of villains who make it dangerous to report on the chaos that has been reigning in Mexico.
There is no end to the violence, and the more bodies accumulate across the country, the greater the number of journalists - according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, at least 25,589 journalists have been under state protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states.
The latest casualties include their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist", Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, though his presence can be felt everywhere - on the facade of the Riodoce building, there is a large picture of Valdez with a middle finger with the words "Justice" on it, and two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his signature panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss a shared trauma, their own nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate state prosecutor's office was created in 2010 to handle cases of journalists, only two cases have been prosecuted, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders per year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, the killers of journalists rarely go to trial.
Riodoce continues to portray the violence in Sinaloa, even as their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the killers' records and justice, Ibarra says the security briefing is of little use.
"It's very silly to waste your time in this meeting", he says.
"Until you know the reason, you're gonna keep everybody quiet".
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiac√°n, the state capital, on the morning of May 15.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before two men pulled over in his red Toyota Corolla, forced him out of the car and shot him 12 times, presumably because of the newspaper's name, which translates to "the twelfth river".
The gunman drove Valdez's car away and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors are spreading freely in Culiacan.
But the Valdez issue is largely silent.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival cliques fight to fill a power vacuum.
It doesn't matter if a person or even several are shot on the streets of Sinaloa every day or if the cemetery is crammed with lavishly decorated double drug king mausoleums larger than the homes of many living.
Forget for a moment that peacetime refers to when a sea-coastal state with valuable ports and the most lucrative routes to the United States is run by a single cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the risks involved in his work, Riodoce co-founder and director Ismail Bojorquez (60) feels a huge sense of guilt for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes the killing was facilitated by two errors.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with Damasso Lopez, a rival and war-torn cartel clique, of Guzman's sons.
This piece of mail may have angered the sons - suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newspaper shelves.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a scandal occurred in another newspaper reporting the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would live forever.
He was working as a veteran reporter for the newspaper Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling $50 shares.
Bojorquez said that in Sinaloa "it was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem".
In time, the newspaper gained a reputation for its bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters enjoyed publishing powerful research without fear of censorship, and they captivated readers with printed stories that no one else dared to tell.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) for his courage in following Mexican drug trafficking wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on", he said when he accepted the AKK award.
In an interview with Rompeviento TV last October, he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to accept the task that comes with the press office. The other option is to play dumb.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't tell them what was going on".
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, the comedian who robbed like a sailor, the friend who kindly shared ambushes and advice, the teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to the bar across the street, El Guayabo, and he always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love got him killed.
His death has also left them questioning how best to do their job and survive.
"They don't like you hanging around their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs".
"Those things were not to be touched", said Bojorquez.
The result is strong self-censorship and self-absorption even in the best of times.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's how Javier got it".
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, or other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
The room where Riodoce employees were meeting for security training was suddenly off-limits to cell phones; a few days before, it was revealed that only government-sold spyware had been used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two officers were outside the house, looking for relief from the 40-degree heat under the shade of a tree.
The government assigned them to oversee the Riodoce office, located in a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiac√°n.
Some reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 percent of officers whom the governor himself had branded unreliable.
It's been months since reporters have been driving to the mountainous countryside, where de facto control is in the hands of the drug cartels.
This week's issue of Riodoce covered three major stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had a story about a government spending on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block away from the DA's office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so you had to be careful when writing what everyone in town knows - the restaurant is a hotbed for drug dealers and law enforcement alike.
The reporter learned from public records that the restaurant is registered to a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which has dominated all levels of politics for almost the entire last century.
In recent times, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked a reporter to report on previous incidents at the same location, including how Guzman's son, nicknamed El Chapo, escaped from the military road.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have looked to Valdez's column to get information on the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have known what happened earlier", said Villarreal, 46, whose slim build has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"All communication channels with our sources have now been cut off".
The Waldes office has become a repository for signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and the editorial staff has been given something they never expected: activists for the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few stamps and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for another reporter's protest.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoac√°n three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body was found, and officials say it's his, based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal, displaying the phrase "SOS press" on sidewalks and buildings as an organized protest.
On this day, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., trying to rally international support to bring justice to the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death, in a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked to be redirected from reporting on government activities, worried that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "confined" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Drug History", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs but also by politicians and security forces who are in the midst of organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to silence you", Ramirez said.
Murders are obviously blood-thirsty.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macia in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter, presumably signed by the Los Zetas cartel, saying, "I'm here for my coverage".
Next to his severed head lay a computer keyboard and earphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after their correspondent Miroslava Breach was killed in March.
Others will pass on the news, as El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of its editor in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke publicly to the drug cartel with the front-page headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
This is a nerve-wracking decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find work, and they still have to hide in the streets to avoid danger.
And sometimes they're being hunted, as was probably the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four other women in a Mexican apartment in 2015, three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
Those who stay put and keep working have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the narcotics business scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell", he said, "and that's why I became a reporter".
One recent Friday at midnight, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce's editors were sitting on the sidewalk outside the office sipping beer when suddenly everyone's phones began vibrating.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people were confirmed dead in a firefight between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by the many cartel messages found in the area.
From the sidewalk below, reporters posted the story on the Riodoce website using their mobile phones.
The next day, the front desk needs changing.
Sirens were flying past, another firefight in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the officers on duty to see if they were on duty.
If they were, they didn't even show it.
Below the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the paper, with his middle finger visible throughout Sinaloa, was a work by Riodoce employees in his footsteps.
"How could I even think of closing", Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send him out to the streets to report?"
The dinosaur used a protective dye to ward off enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though it's quite scary.
Scientists have now made public the first findings regarding the incredible rhinoceros-sized creature discovered by a Canadian excavator, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that his skin covered with fins was reddish-brown and that his past had been somewhat "difficult".
A report in the journal Current Biology described the creature as "the best preserved dinosaur ever found" and "one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a new species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredible preservation has attracted scientists, who describe it as "really remarkable".
This fin-covered vegetarian is the best preserved fossil of this type ever found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk while mining at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada.
He found something that didn't resemble the surrounding rock, and decided to look closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, work was done to dig the animal out of the 2,500-pound (1,100-kilogram) plot.
After all this hard work, the final result is now finally ready to be presented to the public.
"If you blink a little, you can almost believe it's asleep", said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.
"It will go down in the scientific press as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens ever - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
Examining its skin, researchers found that this herbivore, which is covered in fins and resembles a walking tank, was likely significantly threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
This multi-finned dinosaur used red and white defensive dyes to hide from predators and employed a technique called counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This, experts say, allowed the dinosaur to blend in better and avoid enemies, since larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt it.
This 110-million-year-old creature from the family of nodosaurs made its first appearance in the news in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers have now studied the creature and named it Borealopelta after Mark Mitchell of the Mitchell Museum Laboratory, who was part of the team that spent more than 7,000 hours uncovering the elusive creature.
Thanks to the amazing preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the fins on the animal's body.
They discovered the counter-shading, a common defense mechanism in the animal kingdom, which means the upper half of the creature was darker than the lower.
Although shelter is common, the finds come as a surprise, since the Borealopelta is much larger than any shelter species alive today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was hunted actively enough by other carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred hiding over confrontation as a survival tactic.
But most modern shelters - such as deer, zebras, and armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable to prey, suggesting that nodosaurus must have struggled to survive.
"The intense hunt for the enormous, multi-finned dinosaur shows just how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period might have been", said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the fins also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its intestines, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe the dinosaur fell dead into the river, then reached the sea with a torrent, where it sank back to the ocean floor.
Alberta was as warm then as South Florida is now, and the rivers and oceans likely extended farther inland than they do now.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered in preserved fin skin, while remaining three-dimensional, preserving the animal's original shape", said Brown.
"As a result, the animal now looks almost exactly as it did in the Cretaceous.
It does not take much imagination to reconstruct it - just blinking your eyes makes it seem as if it is asleep".
During the Cretaceous, the Earth was inhabited by giant, two-legged, carnivorous dinosaurs called theropods.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, this feathered dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable predecessors.
Among them is the Acrocanthosaurus, a monster that was 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and weighed six tons.
Scientists, whose recent findings are published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta disappeared into the Dead Sea and mummified in the mud.
The existence was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk while he was mining at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved fin dinosaur in the world, including skin and fins, and it is intact from cone to tailbone.
These creatures averaged 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20-inch-long slashes protruded from its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this fin-covered herbivore was adventuring through what is now Western Canada until a flooded river threatened its open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial site helped preserve its finer details in splendid detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular animal are so well preserved that the rough plates along the dinosaur's skull are still covered in skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine: "Such a level of conservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The fossilized remains of the skin still cover the rough plates of the animal's skull.
The right front leg lies next to it, and the five toes are extended upward.
I can count the finches he has".
How did one activist find the answer to the question, "Whose streets?"
On August 9th, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was in complete shock.
Just one day after his trip to New York, this St. Louis resident was sitting in a room he rented through Airbnb, on his bed, browsing Facebook on his phone.
He found a postcard from a former classmate.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still lying on the street".
He was confused why no one else had posted this information to his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Posts by the likes of @TheePharoah were repeatedly shared on his timeline.
A St. Louis-area rapper broadcast a live feed of the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, who was shot and killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying in the street, staying there for four hours.
"This is crazy", Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later that night he saw another alarm, this time of a crowd on Canfield Drive.
Photos of police officers and screaming people were shared, as well as a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He was watching a live stream of a police officer with a barking dog standing in front of a group of protesters.
In another video, another cop, he said, pulled a gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals".
Ferrell recalls being struck by the thought, "This is unusual".
"This is not the kind of murder we're used to and what we might call typical".
I felt like a freak at the time.
I was angry and I cried".
He booked a flight back and drove home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., he went to his father's house to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that the two of them would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the central theme of the new documentary "Whose Streets?" which opens in theaters on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience from the perspective of the people who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell and his daughter, wearing a floral dress and a fitting crown, drove to Ferguson, they recounted a subject that had been repeatedly discussed before that morning - the experiences and conditions of black people.
"Remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for their rights?" he remembers asking himself.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it's not right".
"I couldn't help but take her", Ferrell said later.
"What is happening now is... the culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know it and see it and grow up in the middle of it.
He needs to learn about activism and organization, and he needs to know about the different layers of black experience and conditions, and what we need to do to be free and to free ourselves.
Even if I can raise her without experiencing the personal racism that I've been talking about, she's no different than any other black girl.
I feel like I'd make him a bearskin if I could protect him from this world".
The first stop they made when they reached Ferguson was on the way to South Florissant, a place across the road from the police station that had become a kind of campground where activists waited for news of Officer Darren Wilson, who was ultimately not charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunch.
They were putting food packages together and helping to distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new kind of activism was slowly taking shape.
"My activism completely changed after 9/11," she said, noting that when she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Union and focused on food rights and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It was all just a fling".
Weeks later, during an evening protest, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, the co-director of a film.
Folayan said that he and cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was happening.
Ferrell had this question in his mind: "Are you trying to document what's going on or find a story that can be used?"
Such skepticism was due to the countless instances of people - often white people - coming into the community and trying to profit from its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not being heard, and we wanted to do it differently".
Folayan had already struck up a relationship with co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row.
His involvement made the project binding for Ferrell and six other locals whom the "Whose Streets?" crew had been tracking for years after Brown was shot.
"No one speaks for us or with us in this documentary", said Davis.
"It was important to me how these people were portrayed, because that's how I'm portrayed".
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement was not "a leader of the redeemer, but a gathering of the community", as Folayan put it - he became the most open participant in the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" surprisingly documents personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked", said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw the finished linen.
"But I realized that doing this work and humanizing black people has to come with a certain vulnerability".
Moreover, Ferrell's story emphasizes and re-focuses the role of the black homosexual woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who thought out the #BlackLivesMatter slogan on social media after the 2012 murder of a black teenager, Trayvon Martin, are homosexuals.
"The leading role of black lesbian women has been to keep the movement going", said Ferrell, "and that's because we have to fight on multiple fronts all the time.
Black gay women have to carry all this burden".
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is really being sustained by black women, and many of them are black homosexual women".
He also argues that "this is not a level playing field type of thing" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the focus of the film because of his identity.
"He was a man of the right energy", she said.
"But it's no coincidence that she was right on the front lines, "because as a black, gay woman, "living in these hubs is a lot of work.
His energy can be seen through the screen".
Meanwhile, news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but the racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
Ferrell's suspended sentence for blocking the highway during a protest is two and a half years.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area he calls home, simply "tohuvaboh".
Yet he still cherishes the mantra he has memorized since he walked the streets of Ferguson three years ago in good health.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Our obligation is to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains".
7 tips on how to get over the weekend party craziness
Some of the more stubborn men find after a sunny party that whatever's wrong, helps.
Or they're based on the saying "no more pot, no more booze".
But it's just inevitable procrastination and a big gamble on your health.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning after today's and tomorrow's weekend trolley - or any other party - and to get over the headache as painlessly as possible?
Drink some water.
On and off, after the big party in the morning... or even in the place of alcohol if possible.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when it drinks alcohol, it must find a way to get it back.
Along with water, the body also flushes out minerals, and the water is good to drink.
Since the stomach is often irritated after a nap, it is especially good if the product is bubble-free or only slightly gassed.
Go for a walk.
It certainly would not be worthwhile to go to grandma's house with a hammer to cut down trees - it could prove to be a fatal misjudgment.
But a light walk helps the body to remember what it feels like to be alive.
Lying in a tent and digging out the shell is a more time-consuming way to recover.
Restore energy to your body slowly and gently.
If you're starting to puke from last night's drinking, you shouldn't try to load a big fat roast into a chuck.
Start with fresh juice, for example, where the fruit sugars are quietly released into your body.
If your health is already suffering at lunchtime, you might try some stew.
And then a little later, the spine.
Avoid the coffee.
This diuretic will drain your body of every last drop of water.
Like I said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on the painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent nighttime nausea, your liver has to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol, and it loses its power.
You'll damage your liver even more, and the next time you'll have a bad cold.
Besides, the pain reliever doesn't stay in the body for long anyway.
If you take painkillers in the morning, do not do so on an empty stomach - it will irritate your already-riddled stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you can get along with yourself.
It's about the same as walking, but walking doesn't orgasm.
Avoid over-active pace and perverse postures - moderate physical exertion should be used during the rush hour.
You got to be kidding me.
Talk foolishly with your fellow carriers, do simple stupid things, and laugh friendlyly at yourself and others.
Laughter and laughter may not make the hiccups go away, but they certainly make the aftermath more enjoyable to bear.
Someday the pooh will pass anyway!
A Northwestern professor and an Oxford University employee are wanted on suspicion of murder.
Police say they're searching the country for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who have become suspects after the body of a man with fatal stab wounds was found in a Chicago luxury apartment.
According to Cook County court documents, warrants were issued Monday for the arrest without bail of Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, charged with first-degree murder in connection with the alleged death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the records, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died from multiple stab wounds.
According to a warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police received a call and found the victim in the Grand Plaza apartment building with multiple stab wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, officials said, and investigators are treating the stabbing as a homicide, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
University Vice President of Public Relations Alan K. Cubbage said in an e-mailed statement that Lathem has now been suspended from his duties and banned from the Northwestern University City Hall.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating with investigators", said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior assistant in the finance department at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist the US investigative agencies in any way we can".
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, the communications director for the Chicago Police Department, urges all suspects to turn themselves in.
"Police have a clue where they are, but we're working more and more to pinpoint their exact location", Google told the newspaper.
Google says local, regional and state authorities are helping to track down suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building who had just received a cryptic tip that something was happening in apartment 1008.
Police described it as a silent scene.
Google said it was unclear whether the event itself also occurred on July 27.
He said the security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were in a relationship", he added to Google.
The Grand Plaza administration sent a letter to the residents: "Police are working to establish the chronology of events and the background of the victim and are investigating various motives, including the possibility of a family feud".
Image companies that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys were unproductive.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, misleading.
And even though he promised to guarantee anonymity, some employees didn't trust the process.
"It just wasn't consistent and objective", said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce hair care company in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called in outside help.
A new type of human resources start-up is emerging, helping companies to find out what their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software with the clear aim of measuring employee engagement, they enable companies to conduct snap-queries, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and a complaint hotline, and in some cases allow language-carryers to bypass C-level managers and contact management directly.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your business?" asked Jim Barnett, cofounder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett says that in the three years he has been using Glinth, he has gained a much better understanding of what his employees think and feel.
In addition to random surveys and surveys targeting specific teams, it provides a company heat map that gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, enabling it to identify the reasons.
Companies are starting to realize that they need to stay abreast of their work culture in order not to become the next Uber, which has been mired in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing a harassing environment where those who dared to speak out were punished.
For startups like Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a Denver, Colorado, start-up that helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, saw an increase in interest and activity this year against the backdrop of Uber's dubious reputation.
Convercentil has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized impulse surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view hot maps of problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous message line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when the CEO gets involved, complaints go straight to the board.
"Public opinion has been hijacked by regulators", said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convergent.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to be mistreating its employees or behaving unethically, the company could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee layoffs and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25 000 employees at 500 locations, has been using Convergent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures and to provide an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he would have to find the phone number or e-mail address of the corporation headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, said James Vitrano, general counsel for Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
However, now that a company uses Convergent, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices that did not previously reach managers in offices in other cities or states can be detected and addressed more quickly.
"I'm able to get closer to a holistic 360-degree experience for employees", said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees".
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee engagement much more seriously in 2002, perhaps after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed over ethical violations in the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until "social media matured" that companies realized they couldn't stop their laundry from being washed in public online.
"Before the use of technology to track ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy", he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies periodically for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an option that has the approval of venture capital investors who have been supportive of both start-ups.
In February, Convergent was funded by $10 million from Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the total capital raised to $47 million.
Glinti invested $10 million in November with Bessemer Venture Partners, raising the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments are not surprising given the interconnectedness of enterprise, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that today's workers expect more from their work than ever before.
In highly competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and exciting projects are just the bets on the table.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and that they are dedicating their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy at the company, feel listened to, and feel satisfied with the work they do, they are more committed to making the company successful", said Nina McQueen, vice president of general benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convergent and Glinth.
Investors earn income when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and involvement, it is not surprising that they will find support.
According to experts in work culture, it is important to have data on employee involvement.
But this data is useless unless the company's supervisors do something about it.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it may create expectations that change is imminent.
And if changes are not made quickly enough or not at all, it can lead to frustration and reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 interviews", said Russell Raath, president of consulting and business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying on too much data collection.
"Because if things don't go to the end, the employees think, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly surveys among employees, was able to implement measures on the same day that the problem was reported via Glinth.
And after receiving feedback from employees who were disappointed with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, is collecting new data on employees and is expected to lead to long-term employee engagement in an industry known for its high labour mobility.
"If you're not committed to transparency, you're going to lose people", Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses".
The Baltic States are the brightest stars in the euro area: income is growing fast
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have affected the Baltics, the three Baltic states are rapidly moving closer to the income levels of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg reports, citing a report by the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999 gross economic output per head in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
The success of the EU is due to low debt burden, fast-moving institutions and trade and free-market policies.
"The Baltic States, together with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries with real GDP per capita purchasing power significantly closer to the EU average", the ECB said.
While the aim is to break the GDP per capita of Western Europe, in 2015 the GDP per capita of the Baltic economies was only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries that were part of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement.
Low wages have led the Baltics to seek better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, the local population is not at all enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvians and Lithuanians estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of those surveyed thought so about their respective economies.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the two-a-day training camp makes the Bruins' days long.
It's almost 11:00 p.m. when a trio of UCLA football players stop to chat at the edge of the team's new practice field on campus.
Some have ripped off their shirts, revealing their sweaty backs from the exertions of the first day of training camp.
For most of the crew, these power minutes provide a midday break.
After three hours of training, players in summer courses head back to the common room to study for their final exams before returning the next morning at 6:30 a.m. for meetings at the Wasserman Soccer Center.
"The next three days are a real challenge for them", said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the two-a-day training session to reduce the players' workload has actually made their days longer - at least until they're halfway through the finals on Friday.
For that reason, UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the already tight schedule of the players.
The transition from two training sessions a day means more one-day sessions - the start of the Bruins training camp was pushed up by almost a week from the previous season and for the first time in Mora's six Westwood seasons, training will take place during the summer courses.
They have 18 practice sessions through August 20th before the official preparation for the September opener against Texas A&M.
Mora says he's in favor of changing NCAA rules, although it adds another item to the tight schedule for the players.
"They have a tremendous load on three or four days, and that's a real challenge", Mora said.
"And they're breaking through it; they're pushing, they're great young people.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really nice".
When camp is over, UCLA will make training a closure, which is no easy task given the clear view of their fields from the nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luskini Center, a high-end hotel that has already been hit by footballs that have escaped through the defensive grid surrounding the goalpost.
Starting this weekend, the hotel will be occupied by the Bruins, but Mora acknowledged that there could be problems with the rooms available during the season.
"We're putting in place security measures", Mora said.
"It's a real concern, and it's not an exaggeration to think that people can rent a room and film a workout there.
If you have a recording of the workout, it's a pretty good deal.
But we're using security teams there and in parking lot 8.
We're gonna make the best of what we have.
I'm trying not to worry about it too much.
We have a plan".
The Savisaare-Ivanova electoral alliance, which was born in retaliation for the Centre Party, the union of Kristiina Ojuland, expelled from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljuste, who was forced to leave EKRE, Our Tallinn and the election alliance of businessmen, which is aimed at showing off party members, Actus Tallinn - it seems that the electoral alliances created at the initiative of those who have been able to boil down party politics, will participate in the local elections this year at least as much as the parties.
But the polls are due in the fall, and the key question is whether they'll all have enough disappointed voters.
Who stays with Savisaar?
If the support of Edgar Savisaare has diminished, one can guess from the events organized in honor of his electoral alliance.
One member of the National Assembly, a few former and current members of the Centre Party and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral alliance?
And the reason why some of Savisaare's loyal supporters and friends in Tallinn are avoiding the candidacy, can be traced to the fact that the "Savisaare list" of corrupt and suspected corruption offenders is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the municipal building for a Russian-language pop song with the participation of the mayor of Lasnam√§e; and a completely original computer game in which the prime minister, Yuri Ratas, has to avoid the squirrels and bugs on his bike - is this the first time the Centre Party is trying to get the votes of 16- and 17-year-olds allowed to vote at the ballot box?
We'll see what other parties think of the youthful campaign.
If, from the beginning of August, a viewer of Channel 2 or TV3 looks at a black box instead of an entertainment channel, he will have two options: agree to see only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and the English-language France24 channels in the future, or to give them to a certain operator on the tenth of each month.
There are probably those who, at first, publicly enjoy the ad-free television experience but eventually, however reluctantly, pay for the TV and the advertising.
Deafening music, noisy crowds, and garbage left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don't want to be part of the noise, instead of getting your head around the house, you might want to explore your homeland - and for a hefty sum, leave your place for the festival guests.
Washington is changing the rules for green cards.
The media quotes President Donald Trump as saying that a new U.S. immigration plan is in the works that will change the rules for green cards.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family oriented visas.
The new rules were proposed by the Republicans and the president backs them.
The bill is going to both houses of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars in taxpayer dollars by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The bill will reduce the chain of command and replace the current program.
The new application process will give preference to candidates who speak English and have the financial means to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy", Trump said, according to US media reports.
Siberian Seto youths move to the city, retirees back to the country.
Yevseyev Anatoly continues the tradition of the famous gold miners of the ancient Seto on the banks of the Mana River.
He works 140 kilometers from home as a driver in a gold mine on the Kuvai, a tributary of the Mahanadi River.
It's hard work: two months without a day off, 12 hours of work, and then only 10 days at home and back again.
In three years of working at Artell, Anatoli has only seen gold once.
"There are strict rules: when entering, there is a thorough check to ensure that no alcohol is brought in, and when leaving, there is a check to ensure that no gold is taken away", says Anatoli.
Mare Piho was chatting with local seto Jan in the village of Haida, who had told her much about his family's memories in Siberia.
The archaic culture of the Siberian setos is beginning to affect the home setos, because it's just so amazing, says Piho Mare, who has studied the most distant setos in depth.
This year marks 30 years since his first exploration of Siberia.
In that time, he's been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many settlers, after all, emigrated to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get land here?
That's an open question.
I'd say eight thousand.
I figured it out from the stories of the men in the Siberian Seto who've thought about it themselves.
It is difficult to say exactly, since at that time up to 30 people could come in a group, but only one man was given a passport.
Only one was issued a passport, but he had children, sisters, relatives.
Look how big this territory was!
It was several times larger than the historic Setoma.
It had to be educated, managed somehow.
The ancestors came here as farmers, but their lives changed because here they found themselves in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (palm parching), gold mining, industry.
In New Petersburg, for example, many relatives later went to work in the secret city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (where the Soviet government built the J.P. uranium enrichment plant) when it was formed.
Did the cousins make up the majority of the population in this area at the time?
Yeah, they lived comfortably.
In addition, the tradition of intermarriage and the practice of having many children persisted for a long time.
Seven or eight kids in a family was normal.
How different was the culture of the Siberian setos from that of the setos of the motherland?
They're different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of folk tales.
They did it themselves, but they always distinguished between what was brought in and what was done here.
Climate change has greatly affected the traditional dress of the Setos, for it is colder here.
The food changed.
In Setoma, for example, they salted the meat, but here they just froze it.
Where are the Siberian settlements of the Setoids and what kind of life is lived there? / Graph: Alaric Paluots
The bond with the mother was strong spiritually, considered very important.
I think it's gonna start to bring the Setland back in, start to affect them.
These girls who have lived in these families have heard amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to Haida village in early July for the Day of the Seto Kingdom and stayed in the homes for four days - J. P.
What's left here is amazing.
"It's very easy to come and go to Tapaj√≥s because it's a great place to be, at a railway junction and at a crossroads", says opera singer Reigo Tamm, from Tapaj√≥s.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have plenty of nature, sports and cultural sites, and pizza is everywhere.
Kill is the top city!
There is a small island in the White River that runs through the city where the hunters have a feast.
"You can't see this beautiful place from the train window", Reigo whispers.
If you're not afraid of the cold, you can swim in this river, because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming in it, I can do it!
You can have a picnic on the riverbank and just have a little romance - you can watch the river flow and think about life before and after.
I've been out there with my brides.
Tamm, an opera singer, has also been to the riverbank between three bridges to practice his charms: "Because this place is on the edge of town, no one might come if they were to tell their own stories".
"M√§nnikum√§e offers a wonderful view of the Tapa, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and, for example, play disc golf - the golf course has been built, the chains can be borrowed from the sports centre", says Reigo.
The old pros go there with their gears, of course, but I haven't been there yet.
I think you should invite your colleague Rasmus Kull to kill him, because he's an experienced disc golfer and he has chains.
He's going to lend me the money!
Reigo and M√§nnikumagi were inseparable from the childhood of the current opera soloist.
At least during skiing.
There's a lot of tears, disappointments and victories left on this mountain in my athletic life.
Not to mention the broken earrings and skis.
"The whole city center is now under construction, and everything is changing", Reigo boasts.
But the old and tired cotton mill is a very attractive place to play summer games.
I'm glad that in 2012, the head of the R.A.A.A.M., M√§rt Meos, accepted my idea and came to make a vocal summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's "Alex Karenini" season is over, on August 11th, the station will be hosting "The Resurrection", a tour of the old cotton mill in the 1980s.
"The 11th-13th of August is the Tapa City Days, which include open houses and cultural events on the streets, including a folk parade", says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city on those days.
The little yellow house on the 1st of May has been a museum since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are well-stocked and the information is vast", says Reigo, which is full of the history of the city of Tapa, much of which focuses on railroads and warfare.
Reigo says if the killer goes through all the recommended places, the long-haired man's stomach will be empty, but luckily, the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good places to eat, and sometimes sitting in a cafe feels like being abroad", she explains.
Educated and young soldiers who come to the battle spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, and it's a strange feeling to sit there, that you're in Estonia and your hometown, but you're surrounded by such an international company.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we are moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
The TV channel bTV quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying that two Bulgarians had been arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, police arrested a group of people, including two Bulgarians, who were camping illegally on the Sithonia Peninsula.
They were released the same day, but they're under investigation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV channel bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on camping and are already imposing harsh fines on anyone caught camping in an unsanitary area.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry says the court can impose a fine.
Puppy-training wolves are breaking up sheep.
After a year's rest, the farmers in the fields have to give the wolves "training material" from their herds - evidently the wolves who trained the puppies have already broken many sheep.
This year, wolves have broken sheep in Hiu County three times, killing 23 sheep and injuring eight, reports the Hiu Leaf.
I only had three numbers, 124 the year before.
The data from the Environment Agency also show that no wolf pairs were born on the island this year, and the information from the Iceland Evaluation Board that two wolf pairs have been recorded on the island this year.
On Monday night, wolves broke into 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna, near Emmas, injuring half of the 18 that survived.
Early Wednesday morning, in the pasture of the village of Reheselja, wolves broke one sheep and seriously injured another, which had to be euthanized.
The rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Agriculture sent the draft amendments to the Act on the release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act to the Coordination Circle.
The amendment to the law will eliminate the need to create separate data sets for both locations and operators of genetically modified (GM) crops, and will use the plant health register for this purpose.
In addition, the GM crop operator is obliged to have a prior agreement with the person engaged in beekeeping within the prescribed radius.
Although no genetically modified crops are currently grown in Estonia, we believe that clear rules are necessary for the coexistence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
This will be the case at least until the decision is made to declare Estonia GMO-free", said Sigmar Suu, head of the Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Agriculture.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden incurred by both the private and public sectors", Suu added.
The draft law repeals the provisions concerning the collection of data on the locations of GM crops and operators in the GMOVS and the training in handling, and establishes the requirements for the handling of GM crops and the commencement of economic activities.
In particular, in the case of beekeeping, the existing obligation of the GM crop producer to notify the beekeepers of the start of the GM crop is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before the start of the production.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult the draft information system and, if they wish, to submit their views to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes will affect in particular those active in the crop sector, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop, maize MON 810, is permitted to be grown.
However, no Estonian farmer has so far shown interest in growing GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no corn pest, the European strain of the common cold, to which the MON 810 maize strain is resistant in Estonia.
Also, varieties of this type of corn are grown in southern regions and are not suited to our climate.
In order to be ascertained in advance, the Ministry of Agriculture has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination with GMOs in seeds of various varieties of subhumic acid, maize and soybean grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain any foreign genes and the study concluded that the seeds of the rapeseed, maize and soybean varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
The preliminary conclusion is that no intentionally genetically modified crops are grown in Estonia and that no accidental contamination has been confirmed.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Maticu in the form of a "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed Nemanja Maticu as a "genius" after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The ¬£40million transfer from Chelsea started in the last pre-season game for United in Dublin ahead of a 2-1 home win against Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup on Tuesday, impressing in defence, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were given free-kicks on the road.
However, having missed out on the Blues' pre-season tour of Asia, Matic was badly lacking in form and only lasted 45 minutes, which Mourinho said he must definitely improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant mindset - he has the spirit of football", Mourinho said.
"Let's get him in shape as soon as we can".
Like Matic, other new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the starting lineup at the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho quietly began to put in place his eleventh starting man for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to sign three more players, but he confirmed that the club has already done a "great job" by signing three of his four priority picks.
"I'm grateful to the club that they were able to realise three of the four", he added.
"I'm happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me".
Another young boy got his foot on a GSM transmitter on August 1st, this time in Mukha.
According to the birder Matt Martinson, the first nesting infant was a Finger equipped with a transmitter, and this nesting colony is already flying around, having left its nesting site and joining the large overnight population of the Mullutu-Great-Finger.
That's because there's no cornfield in the Ring, says the Voice of the Islands.
That Tuesday, a little late to ring the bell, the messenger got another son of a bitch, and that one on Pump Island.
Martinson says that the installation of the transmitters is actually an international project being carried out by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
I was given a GSM transmitter by a punk named Mati on Finger Turtle.
"His activities are all on the internet: how he went to Spain to winter, came back and spent some time on the German-Polish border, and then came to Saarland", Martinson said.
A British inventor had a microchip implanted in his body to access a house and a car with a wristband
A British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so that he could open his forehead, get into an office, and even start a car with a simple flick of the wrist.
Steven Northam, 33, had a tiny chip installed between his thumb and forefinger and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure that the installation procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company also replaces the locks on houses and cars to fit the chip, charging ¬£300 for each lock.
This married father of one has now installed technology in both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibit cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars.
According to military documents released to TIME magazine, the White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to a Southside event last month to celebrate American manufacturing cost taxpayers a whopping $24,000.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One during the president's stay aboard, was the centerpiece of the July 17 White House event introducing America's construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials have been updating industrial products in all 50 states.
A Connecticut-built helicopter was displayed along with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a fork lift made in Mississippi.
According to Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the squadron responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House War Cabinet requested a joint command of the helicopter, FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern outskirts of the city for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it's an unusually high-profile event", the commander of the HMX-1 said in an e-mail to his commanding officer, the Navy's deputy commanding officer for aviation, the day before the event.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the south courtyard on July 17 for the 7:15 a.m. start time and would remain until the courtyard was cleared between 6:00 and 9:00 p.m. that evening.
Added to the fact that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, the return flight would require a second crew due to the restrictions on working hours.
The initial flight crew was present at the time of the incident and the squadron security team was present at the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
The documents given to TIME magazine were not able to tell whether the second crew was eventually needed or not.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether the event in question might violate this provision.
"We asked if it violated the Hatch Act, and we were told it did not", the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have a choice", replied the deputy commanding officer.
The White House declared the event "Made in America" and the Hatch Act would not cover it.
But even at official events, there are political undertones.
The president supported the efforts to reform health care, which was being debated in the Senate at the time, and praised efforts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for political gain is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them for travel.
But the requirement to use them purely for photo shoots is unusual.
Trump came to attention in February when a presidential plane was set in the background of his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is littered with messages complaining about the way his predecessor used the presidential plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the 'Made in America' exhibit, which features products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials", said acting White House press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often make test flights around Washington and the South Pole to practice landing the President of the United States at the White House with centimeter accuracy.
When Trump was in Germany for the G20 summit in early July, the HMX-1 conducted 58 test flights in the White House courtyard.
According to the official, the flight to the "Made in America" event was considered a standard flight training for the crew that month.
The squadron's helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions".
According to the White House, no other exhibit from this event loaded into the taxpayer's pocket.
According to the representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in the organisation of the helicopter's display in the southern outdoor area.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget documents for the President's flights, and the exact costs of the event are difficult to determine.
But according to the Department of Defense's 2017 fiscal year hourly rates, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
Squadron records indicate the flight time from this base at Naval Air Station Quantico, Virginia, in both directions, was 30 minutes.
The White House claims the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that amount.
'The calculation of taxpayer costs on the basis of estimated rates of compensation is highly misleading,' said Mr Walters.
'These estimated amounts of compensation include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs which are taken into account in the annual appropriations.'
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was defending the use of the helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to showcase things made in America this week", Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and that there are supposedly hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I believe that, like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and the other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to build.
So of course it's right to bring it up".
It's unclear whether Trump touched the south lawn while making a roundabout at the event or not, but he was behind the wheel of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's representatives, making fun of the company's products in his personal aircraft fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the president, "I have three of their products".
Grit Shadeiko - Peace and Joy Through Tears
At the 2011 World Cup in Daegu, ≈†adeik was hit in the last quarter, suffered a cramp in the 800 metres and was ejected from the stadium with a hand frame.
Shortly before that, he had scored a zero in the long jump at the University Games in China.
In 2012, she was injured in the Helsinki Olympics, but at her debut Olympics in London, she finished 23rd with 6013 points.
The misfortune continued, though.
At the 2013 Moscow World Cup, after the opening day, the Estonian record holder in the long jump suffered a thumb injury.
Two years later, he finished 15th at the Beijing World Championships, meeting the Olympic standard, but even that was more than a disappointment to the athlete.
The toughest fall was for ≈†adeiko, who failed to score in the first leg of the long jump at the Amsterdam European Championships.
I just want to put together a decent multi-tournament for once.
Once", said Shadeiko.
Worse was yet to come: A month later, his Olympic Games in Rio were canceled at the first hurdle because of a hip injury.
Time to take a break. Should we go on with the seven?
Is two days worth all the effort?
The maiden thought long and hard, but she found peace.
I've got my head clear.
It's a relatively difficult experience to describe, but I've been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and clear my head.
"I knew I wasn't going to put the pill in the bag", says Shadeiko about her self-cleaning.
I got to turn the page and move on to the next season.
Coach Anne Mount said it was very difficult to watch the sufferings of the caregiver, but she realized that above all, the athlete must come to terms with himself.
He was so spoiled by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he's not giving up and he wants to prove himself", says Mountain.
Now he's got some peace.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The competition returned in May, when ≈†adeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the G√∂tze multi-sport competition.
In the high-level competition, he improved his personal best in the shot put by nearly a meter (13.89) and ran the hurdles in near-record time.
Then the multi-athlete felt that it was not a skill set at all, but only the primary race hunger was quenched.
The Mountain, who has been his mentor for years, says that Shadeiko is a model student.
He's a ready athlete, he's good to train.
If something's wrong, he'll tell you right away.
He knows his body and trusts his gut.
That's the point.
I can't tell you exactly what to do, and we'll follow it.
A new approach has been found by Shadeiko.
"I'm not the type to do my best", he says, adding that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because that also ensures a good result.
The Happiness of a Baby in the Family
The happiness of loved ones has also brought good emotions to Shadeiko.
Both his former trainer Maris M√§gi and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-athlete has received support from new citizen weathermen.
"It has been quite interesting", says Shadeiko.
One that's equivalent to "training" the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Shepherd is such a big fan of wine that he believes wine can train the brain better than anything else in the world.
Shepherd is a neuroscientist at Yale.
His words are not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but about the "very active" process of tasting wine.
When we smell the glass, turn the wine in our mouth, enjoy it, and taste the aftertaste, we're setting our brain to work to create the taste of the wine.
Shepherd says that wine molecules don't actually contain flavor, but that flavor is created by the way wine stimulates the brain.
He uses the brain's ability to "see" colors as an analogy.
"Taste doesn't make wine taste", says Shepherd.
Other factors that influence the taste of wine include our age, sex, and even the amount of saliva we produce.
Of course, Shepherd reminds us that wine is not for getting drunk.
"There must be more to do", he says.
If you take too big a hit, the system is overwhelmed.
Drinking too much wine may be harmful to the brain rather than good - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine are at risk of memory loss, imbalance, and impaired mental functioning.
10% of Estonian ICT workers are paid less than their colleagues
Data from the recruitment firm Fontes reveal that 10% of Estonian ICT sector employees are paid less than their colleagues.
The gender pay gap is 10 percent, reports Geenius.
The Fonte ICT wage survey involved 59 IT and telecommunications companies.
A total of 8 577 posts were under review.
63% of the posts were occupied by men.
"Although only 3 companies said that wage differentials were in favour of men and the rest of the companies said that there was no wage differential, in reality, compared to similar jobs, men's monthly basic salary is on average 10% higher than women's and men's annual total salary is on average 8% higher than women's", said Ilmar P√µhjala, an analyst at Fontese.
Season 3 trailer for "Narcose": now that Pablo Escobar is gone, the Cali Cartel is the center of Netflix's hit series.
Despite the fact that the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed in the second season of "Narcose", the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and a commercial has already been prepared for the first of them, which will feature new villains.
In season three, the DEA turns its attention to the world's richest drug cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers, "like a Fortune 500 company", just with more government bribes and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the Mexican liaison, and Chepe Santacruz of London (Pepe Rapazote) is operating in New York.
A recent commercial shows Pedro Pascali returning as Javier Penana, the character who recruits American and Colombian law enforcement aid in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narcose" opens on September 1st.
The UN says that the role of women in Afghan democracy depends on the political
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
UN Aid Mission Chief Nicholas Haysom said that hundreds of women are running for local council elections, three are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of the recently registered voters are women.
"The importance of women's role cannot be overstated", she said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved at all stages of the electoral process.
Afghan local council elections and presidential elections are scheduled for April 5.
The Taliban have threatened an election process that coincides with a transitional period, when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's election marks the first time that power has been peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that the strong role of women will increase the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

From the Philippines to the World - A Journey to the Heart of Fashion
Shoulder-knitted bags are a summer classic that has become a hit in its own right in recent years, a must-have for a true summer collector, and despite its modest origins, merchants have been able to add a price tag to the hit.
A shoulder-knotted bag is probably one of those things that everyone has had at one time in their life and that has not caused special emotions.
It's just there, and if it's not, nothing's broken.
Now, though, shoulder bags are making a real splash, and fashion enthusiasts have traded their delicate designer bags for plain shoulder-weave bags during the summer months.
It is not just a beach bag, but it is now a popular street bag, and bold women even walk into the office with it.
However, it is worth first determining whether such a summer look is still appropriate for the boss or whether it is worth putting a notebook and laptop in a more formal position.
But in the interwar period, women have made backpacks their true summer love.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing you notice is that fashion lovers go to the local market on their vacation and buy a pair of shoulder pads that they will wear throughout the holiday season, which they will wear when they go to the beach, the market, and even when they hang out with their friends in the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a larger handful of bags from the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is noteworthy that the demand for bags is so great among readers that in the real world women (and men!) would probably go hand in hand to become the happy owner of a bag.
In a sense, this is understandable, since it is rare to buy a fashion hit for just a few hundred dollars.
True, cunning merchants have discovered an easy way to make money here too, and the more refined luxury brands sell bags of beer for a few hundred to a thousand euros.
Probably so the wealthier customers wouldn't feel like a bunch of pimps walking around with some cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a Dolce & Gabbana bag that costs over a thousand euros.
However, the amount of the fine for interpreting Chanel's purse is ‚Ç¨6,000.
Unlike most fashion hits, however, the shoulder bags do not originate with any major fashion house, but their story began much further back.
The shoulder bags are said to have originated in the far-flung Philippines, where they are widespread.
The shoulder bags are mainly exported and it is not often that locals are seen walking around with them.
The technique of brewing beer is said to date back to the 14th century and is quite similar to ordinary basket brewing.
But since the shoulder bag does not have to bend as hard as a basket, patterns and other materials can be incorporated into it to make the bag more personal and thus more attractive.
For example, recently, bags with colored braids or leather scissors have become especially fashionable.
But the thank-you note for the bags may go to Jane Birkin, the actress who has never seen the biggest bag of hair.
She would fit the bag into any set of clothes and not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival with it.
Not least in the popularity of bags today is the fact that, unlike all other types of bags, they are difficult to care for and do not require special care, as water and a wet towel do the trick.
As with all new trends, brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations beyond the classic look.
For example, if you wish, you can buy a shoulder-length braid or a small shoulder bag.
It's worth remembering, though, that the classic backpack never goes out of style, but the beer grill does.
But what is a classic backpack?
For centuries, the shoulder-woven bag, which is similar in style to a basket, has been considered a classic, open and with short shoulder straps.

GMB is concerned about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The Agency is awaiting confirmation from the management of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie's of long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland has maintained its silence on the future of the investment at Tollcross.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
The owner of McVitie's in the Plains said they've invested more than ¬£5 million in the facility over the last couple of years.
Employees were hired, and union leaders "are the first to hear" if something changes in the factory's operations.
In a letter to the company's project manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie to 'relieve concerns that the funding would not be used to modernise the production lines'.
GMB Senior Organiser Drew Duffy said: 'The fact that we are not getting any clarity from the facility manager on Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans is a matter of deep concern to our members.
It has been home to generations of families and a workforce largely made up of local and Glasgow-area people, essential to provide a more supportive base for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social exclusion.
So the east of Glasgow needs a strongly growing productivity business in McVitie in terms of jobs, wages and wellbeing, and in the context of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic decline in production.'
A spokesman for the plant said: 'The Tollcross project manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company is responding directly to him as we value active communication with staff and union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between the employees and GMB representatives took place in Tollcross, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We then discussed with the employees that, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our companies and facilities - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: 'Over the last few years we have invested over ¬£5 million in the Tollcross facility, much of it in improving production lines and operations.
We fully understand Tollcross as a heritage production facility and if there are any changes in the operation of the facility, the workers and union representatives will be the first to know".
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about approaching Neymar?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain are not giving up on their bid to lure Neymar into their ranks, offering ¬£189 million to buy him, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record-breaking campaign?
This lucrative approach has opened the summer transfer window and the Ligue 1 club is poised to break more than double the current world record for overtaking, set last season with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United for ¬£89 million.
When the transfer is complete, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, earning over ¬£500,000 a week from PSG.
Barcelona are aware of the anger over both the approach and Neymar's free-kick, although a source close to the Catalan board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the president of PSG warn the football world of this possibility three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to any club considering signing some of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will intervene and contact their players", Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they're going to face the consequences".
Barcelona seem to have crossed that line, as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could be hit back by losing one of their most valuable assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build a bridge after Brexit, not a border.
"Brexit threatens to seriously drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland", warned Varadkar on his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it", he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made possible the current free movement of people and goods, said Mr Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders", he stressed.
Mr Treasurer said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and, since this is not possible, to remain part of the European single market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make the UK's departure more smooth would be to create a customs union between the EU and the UK, the Irish Prime Minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could certainly have one with Britain".
The alternative would be to return to the customs points that would declare historic division and political failure.
"To trade, prosperity and peace", said the Irish prime minister.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of everyday life in Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland during a visit to Belfast.
After his first half-long triathlon, Mars Avand: Ironman, anyone can do it.
Today, the winter capital of Otep√§l was the site of the largest triathlon festival in the Baltic States, with nearly a thousand triathletes from over 30 countries competing in the half-long Ironman.
The 70.3-mile distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling, and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, M√§rt Avanda won the first triathlon of his life.
"I thought it would be difficult, and it was", said Avandas at the finish.
Despite the complexity, Avind admitted that the triathlon is actually a good fit for everyone.
"It's not the distance that kills, it's the pace", he said, implying that the pace of the race will get everyone to the finish line.
Except for Ott Sepp: "Even with physics, everything is fine, but unfortunately he can't swim".
Avandi had been training hard since February.
At first, four or five hours a week, but later, ten hours a week.
With a time of 05:34:12, he finished 270th overall.
Although Avand lost both Raio Piiro (time 04:59:53) and J√ºrgen Lig (time 05:06:37), he won the other contestants in the so-called "prominent class".
Last year, Tanel Padar, who was a "good role model", lost to Avand by seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan by 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kallev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm by about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18, respectively).
The overall champion of the Ironman series Otep√§√§ stage was crowned by German Johannes Moldan with a time of 3:58:27, while the best of the Estonians was Ivo Big with a time of 04:14:09.
Among the women, Danish Helle Frederiksen won with a time of 04:24:01, while Estonians Maria J√§nese, who lost to Frederiksen by almost half an hour, finished in 04:58:58.
The swimmer completed the 1.9-mile distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in position 410.
