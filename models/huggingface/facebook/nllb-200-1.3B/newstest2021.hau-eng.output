KORONA VACIN: We have not yet completed the testing of the efficacy of the drug in Nigeria.
While European countries continue to test the efficacy of their combined corona vaccines, Nigeria is not left behind in integrating and testing its own vaccines.
The National Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC) has announced that it is testing 40 new corona drugs submitted by traditional medicine manufacturers.
The head of the agency Mojisola Adeyeye announced this on Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola said the drug is being tested for efficacy so that there is no compensation for obesity.
Since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, traditional medicine practitioners have been splashing research to ensure that they are not left behind in the process of developing a cure.
Many have submitted their products to authorities for testing and evaluation.
The NAFDAC also sets out guidelines and rules for the preparation of the drug.
The efficacy of the drug will be tested on animals for the first time.
Mojisola warns pharmacists not to try any other medicine without the agency's permission.
In May, NAFDAC revealed that only social media and newspaper pages were seeing stories of people claiming to have discovered a traditional cure for the Coronavirus.
Adeyeye said that only one person approached NAFDAC to ask for verification of the efficacy of the drug he claimed to have included the traditional one, which he said could cure the Coronavirus.
This man, too, did not claim to have discovered a cure.
His discovery of a cure for the symptoms of illness was considered a sign of infection.

The APC accuses the Governor of Niger of trying to create a riot in the party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In a statement released by the APC on Tuesday, the party accused the governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of trying to create unrest within the party.
The document, signed by the President of the Engineers Party Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the Secretary of the Barista Party Muhammed Liman, states that, in the six years the party has been in power in the state, it has earned only 512 million Naira.
The document further states that the meeting called by the governor of stakeholders, which he chaired on the night of Sunday last weekend will help to continue the riots in the party, where they said they have written to the party's national secretary about the ongoing events in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "we understand that the Governor of Niger State is trying to divide the party's members by organizing a meeting of stakeholders, which is illegal, because any complaints against the party leaders, are written to the party secretariat of the district, for investigation".
He further said that so far in the six years since the party was founded, 512 million naira have been in the party's account.
He said, what he understands as governor is being on the National Standing Committee which was formed on 25th July, 2020, headed by the President to lead the resolution of the problems among the party members and withdraw the complaints in the courts among the party members.
We have been paying the salaries of the party secretaries, and other party-related services, the primaries and the resolution of other problems of party members such as health benefits due to lack of access to government subsidies, not any party money that we have spent illegally, we are challenging anyone to bring us the proof of party money was wasted.
As I explained, the last local government election was the most important election in the country which we held with the former commissioners and the commissioners who are currently holding the reins of power in all the 25 local government areas of the state, the money spent on the election was shared among the commissioners to bring their electors.
Therefore, it is wrong for anyone to say that the party funds are being spent illegally, this is almost unfair and trying to protect the bad name to try to hang him, he said that no committee should be set up to investigate how the party funds were spent and who set it up.
Of the money that the complainant has said that the money he claims was wasted, the money was provided by the National Party Secretariat, no other funds of this kind, so I challenge anyone on this matter to bring his testimony to prove this accusation of his in any way.
Imam said that we stand firmly on the defense of the APC from any attempt by any party or organization to disrupt the party, adding that any alleged accusations against the party or any party leader from the state level will be written to the district committee as per the party constitution as stated in section 21 (B) (bi), (d) in page 82 of the party constitution.
So the stakeholders of the party have no role to play especially if they try to seize the power of the committee so their decision is not effective.
For this reason, they are the most effective party leaders recognized in the state, in accordance with Article 21 and Paragraph Six of the Article 87 of the Party Constitution, any violation of this shall not be invoked.
Because your decision to dislike and hold on to their leaders is a mistake.
He said, those who presented the draft with unanimous consent at the meeting yesterday, which was not organized by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, as well as Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, were not members of the party executive committee in the state.
The executive committee of the party's watermen and sailors will be headed by the party chief Engineer Mohammed Imam alone and not the governor who will lead the state party leaders.
The document added that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promises made to the people of the state during the election, and moving the party's parents into the government so that everyone benefits in the state and all districts by giving political positions, which is the problem of governor and party.
The document praised the federal lawmakers who refused to attend the meeting and called for a resolution of all the problems among the party members, which is not surprising to the members of the party who are known to be suffering from their own problems, who refused to accept the arrest of the fake as a party law.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the National Interim Committee to impress Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the right position not to attempt to subvert the state's political system.
Let each of us, then, be determined to remain loyal to God and to fellow humans.

How food contaminants are bad for people's health in Nigeria.
Some scientists warn against eating foods that have been treated with food preservatives, saying that such foods are harmful to health.
The experts issued this warning after conducting a study of the quality of the food in the country.
The results suggest that some foods are also treated with preservatives.
The study also found that the chemical was used primarily in the production of beans, porridge, and dried fish for the general market.
The reason for the use of the chemical is that it is a visual stimulus.
The consumption of food containing this chemical causes cancer, kidney disease, heart attack and many others.
The people of the country were urged to be careful about using such foods for their health.
Not to be forgotten, the expert in food safety Grace Olasumbo has urged Nigerians to avoid eating the products of the trees that are ground with calcium carbide.
Olasumbo explains that Calcium Carbide Sandalwood is the most commonly used chemical by retailers for grinding raw wood, vegetables.
Research suggests that the lack of patience and greed are among the factors that lead traders to use this chemical because it can produce a lot of wood in a day.
Olasumbo explained that one thing that marketers failed to understand was that the use of this chemical to promote vegetables is harmful to human health.
This leads to diseases including vomiting and diarrhea, eye pain, stomach ulcers, throat ulcers, mouth ulcers, liver ulcers and many others.

A panel of experts led by former Irish Prime Minister Mary Robinson has cleared the head of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina.

COVID-19 has delayed Trump's campaign rally in Florida.
On Thursday, US President Donald Trump announced that he had canceled the Republican Party ticket convention scheduled to be held in Jacksonville, Florida, next month, due to the surge in coronavirus infections.
However, the convention will be held in North Carolina.
Trump said in Jacksonville that holding a convention was not appropriate at this time.
President Trump moved part of the GOP rally to Florida last month after a dispute with Democratic leaders in North Carolina over holding a closed-door rally with his supporters without wearing a mask.
A small number of Republican delegates will gather in Charlotte, North Carolina, to formally elect Trump on August 24.
Trump said he would give the inaugural address in a different format.
Trump has been showing a consistent attitude about the impact of the pandemic for months, with recently saying that 99 percent of the cases seen in the United States are not going to be a problem.

China Achieves Achievements in Enriching Its People with Food - Leadership English Newspapers.
Food is the life-giving force of all living things, and life cannot be sustained without food.
This is why Chinese officials are increasingly trying to ensure that the country is well supplied with food.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has made remarkable achievements in food security that have shocked the world with its population estimated at over 1.4 billion.
This effort has helped China make a major contribution to the global fight against hunger, as the head of the China Grain and Crop Production Administration Zhang Wufeng once stated that, since 1949, China has always put the fight against hunger at the forefront of all its policies.
But recently, some people and some Western media have again "expressed concern" over the question of whether China can raise its own nation in the shadow of the global COVID-19 respiratory outbreak.
We are grateful for their daily concern for the Chinese in this country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country achieved a food security surplus based on its own efforts.
The issue of providing enough food to the Chinese is one of the main agenda of the ruling JKS party on a daily basis.
Last weekend, the secretary general of the JKS Supreme Committee, Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, issued a key order to stop food waste, pointing out that everyone knows that every single food is hard to come by.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 respiratory epidemic that has plagued the world is also having a negative impact on China's economy, China can still produce enough food for its nation.
The figures released by the Chinese Bureau of Statistics on the country's agricultural output, especially rice, for 2020 show that the country's rice production in the first quarter of 2020 was 27.29 million tonnes, up by 1.08 million tonnes, an increase of 3.9% compared to the same period in 2019.
He also said that China has made significant progress in terms of food security compared to the early phase of implementing the policy of reform at home and opening the door to the outside world.
Huang Jikun, director of the China Agricultural Policy Research Institute of Peking University, said in an interview with "The China Science Daily" newspaper, that the most critical challenge China is facing now is in the next 2 or 3 years, whether China can reduce the amount of wheat and rice it has stored in grain warehouses.
The average annual crop per person is now 474 kilograms, rather than the 400 kilograms per person in the rest of the world.
And China now imports millions of tons of agricultural products for the sole purpose of raising livestock.
Moreover, those expressing concern should calm down, bathe and sleep, or concentrate on domestic affairs.
The Chinese are able to feed themselves on their own food.

Only qualified, the recruitment system should be completed by 2023.
The mother of the President Muhammadu Buhari and a close friend of his, Mamman Daura, has said that the current system of government in Nigeria is outdated.
Mamman Daura said Nigeria has already made a commitment to abandon the current recruitment system and focus on selecting the most qualified candidate by 2023.
BBC Hausa published an interview with Mamman Daura in which he made this statement.
This process of electoral manipulation in Nigeria has not produced a blind son which has been going on since 1999.
Instead, Daura urged that the focus be on selecting the right candidate, not on following the system of selection.
However, members of the Igbo tribe, the Inyamirai, reacted to Daura's comments.
They said that he and his brother President Buhari had won the seats by a takeover and he will now come out and recommend that it not be done in 2023.
He himself was not the most elected Nigerian.
The top security officers who have been sitting in their seats for decades have not been removed, nor are they more capable than others.
The answer of the bulls.
A political storm of Nigerian leadership erupted on Wednesday, as the Igbo Tribal Welfare Association, Ndigbo, dismantled Mamman Daura, over his alleged remarks about the Nigerian presidency to the Inyamurai tribe.
In an interview with Daura, who is the brother of President Muhammadu Buhari, he said that a system of secession would be implemented in the presidential elections to be held in 2023.
So before his remarks were completed on social media, Ndigbo hurriedly issued a statement denouncing Mamman Daura, calling her a partisan fatbag.
In a statement released by Ndigbo on Wednesday, the Igbo National Congress of the Southern Region, and at least the Southeastern Region, will be allowed to run for president in the 2023 elections, the Igbo people.
The spokesperson of the Igbo Zalla Tribal Association, Emeka Attamah said that the comments of Mamman Daura as the candidate for the presidency of Nigeria in 2023 are directed at the Igbo tribe.
Besides greed, why hasn't Mamman Daura spoken out about the takeover since 2019.
They have already dismissed Jonathan, and now Daura is calling for the southern region to be the candidate for Nigeria's presidency in the 2023 elections.
He will not finish his story of what he has heard from his brother, the current president, and then he will come up with an unknown issue of acceptance in 2023.
As an elder, he should embrace the truth and handle it with good judgment.
It is not the intention of the presidency in 2023 that is being expressed, and the intention is selfish and self-serving.

The VOA's discussion of rape.
The issue of rape of women and children is common in northern Nigeria where there are reports of child rights being violated.
On July 23, a meeting of international delegates was held to discuss the worsening situation in the country and the need to address it.

Contribution of 'Northern Media Writers' to the North Alliance.
Modern social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya and others, have long played a role in providing forums, collaboration and friendship among the various global communities, as well as delivering messages, news, and spreading political, educational and business objectives.
Young people in Nigeria are taking part in this new technology by using social media, keeping up with the times, contributing or spitting out news that affects their lives.
We can say that these rounds have brought us many advances that the youth of the North benefit from in business, economy, education and politics of the region.
Many are feeding off of texting and social media, have found employment or have developed their own businesses.
It is sad to see how some young people instead of taking advantage of this opportunity to benefit from the progress made, are found to be following the corrupt children of the south who are world-renowned for public corruption, inside and outside the country, or writing scandalous and abusive articles against the rulers and ancestors.
What is uncivilized, in the development of the young people of this country.
The presence of the Northern Media Writers Association in the country is a great blessing, to provide the young people of the North with a platform, a good direction and to clean up the activities of the young people in the Social Media, so that they can become meaningful writers and spread the ideas of the Northern society.
It was necessary to give this organization the necessary cooperation, to achieve its benevolent objectives, which would bring benefits not only to our Northern region, but to Nigeria as a whole.
I urge our youth, especially those who use social media, to come together to defend the dignity and freedom of the North and create a system that will be a catalyst for change for all.
As our Northern leaders such as the Sakkwato Sards, the first Northern Premier Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his close associates aspired to provide for the people of the North.
It is reported that the late anti-oppression and anti-poverty leader Mr. Aminu Kano, once said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's house!
So we say, of course, while we call for national development and better governance, at every stage, we also call for the unity of the people of the North, without discrimination of religion or ethnicity, to bring our region forward.
The North has changed considerably from what it once was.
So we should use our God-given wisdom to offer suggestions and recommendations, to provide the North with a satisfactory way to revive its economy.
The North should provide revenue streams to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to waste money.
In addition, if we want the development of the North, we give importance to education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
We do not always give money, but there are many ways to do so.
We thought that the North would thus fulfil the dream of our ancestors!
The North is our pride.

In his speech, the candidate for the Senate seat representing Kwara North under the umbrella of the APC Sadiq Umar said that the Nigerian government should take the issues of improving the healthcare in the country seriously.
Failure to do so has led to a financial crisis that has left the industry heavily dependent on foreign aid.
Umar said despite these subsidies, the government's role in the health sector was not seen and so they began to withdraw their subsidies.

The number of people who will die of hunger in Africa will exceed the number of those killed by Coronavirus -IFAD.
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has estimated that there are at least 23 million more people at risk of starvation in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2020.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) reported that its total revenue from oil and gas exports in June amounted to 378.42 million dollars, up from 133.16 million dollars in May of this year.
The Nigerian oil company added that this is the biggest tax increase since the global coronavirus pandemic, which led to the imposition of a travel ban and the drop in oil prices in the global market.
In a letter signed by the company's chief public relations officer, Dr. Kennie Obateru, the NNPC stated that during the month, the NNPC added that it had received a total of $4.60 billion from oil and gas giants between June 2019 and June 2020.

The Stranger is King, I Have Been Praised.
The musical film by singer Beyoncé titled "Black is King" continues to receive both praise and criticism worldwide, for its portrayal of African culture.
In South Africa, where the 85-minute film was made, many said that it was even better than the movie.
Black is King is a musical film directed, composed and completed by American singer and songwriter Beyoncé.
This film was as popular as her poem "The Lion King: The Gift".
Last year, the film was filmed in the United States, South and West Africa, and Europe, and featured a number of African musicians.
The film, released in July, was well received by audiences, but it was also panned.
Some say that Beyonce, who was born in Houston, Texas, USA, illegally borrowed African elements, especially the pro-African characters in the film, although she has no traditional African roots.
But in South Africa, even those who had a part in making the film were overjoyed.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a student of filmmaking, said that he was honored to be included in the film's cast.
He said that the video impressed him.
The film touched on many things that were not taught in school about black history.
He said that he had also seen the film and had first noticed the story, the clothes and the whole scene, which had changed a lot more than he had expected.
Beyonce's fan Kgosi Motosoane said that African diaspora - including black Americans - have access to what some consider to be African cultural heritage.
He was very interested in the film.
Kgosi said that black women were treated as inferior in society.
So their emergence into such influential fields is encouraging.
A filmmaking student, Mathebula said that Beyonce's film made him want to start making the film to spread more information about Africa.
Beyonce's African fans are all over the place on one thing: If the Human Mouth is King, then Beyonce is Queen.

Minister Sadiya Praises the Press and Rescue Workers
Nigeria's Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Welfare, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouk, commended the efforts of the media, aid workers and cooperative agencies on the occasion of the ministry's one-year anniversary.
The agency was created by President Muhammadu Buhari on August 21, 2019 to implement policies and humanitarian activities, prevent disasters and provide emergency relief, and administer relief applications to the needy.
In a press release shared by the media assistant Halima Oyelade, the ministry considered this to be a multi-faceted, challenging and exciting year in which we learned the techniques of public outreach and disaster management, but in all activities we focused on fulfilling the tasks assigned to us which consist of reaching out to the community, preventing disasters and helping disaster victims, and coming up with ways to reduce our disaster risk when disasters occur, which helped us improve our work for the future.
While congratulating the President on his vision of creating a ministry that is at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouk thanked him for putting her in the driver's seat of the ministry he created.
She also noted that during that one year, she had learned valuable lessons and gained new insight into the ways and means of doing this work.
While praising the media, the minister said that these forces are traveling partners with whom it is necessary to join forces for success.
"I want to assure you today that what you are doing is right", she said.
She also said that it is not her funeral that has given her the credit for her achievements, but she is ready that she and her colleagues will continue their work in sacrifice and commitment to fulfill their mission commitments, which is in line with the theme of their one-year anniversary, Service2Humanity.
The ministry expressed special gratitude to "the aid workers and our partners in this sector from UN agencies such as OCHA, IOM, UNHCR and the World Food Agency, World Bank, USAID and European Union (EU), and other cooperating agencies who continue to provide aid despite the current insecurity and hardship they face.
She also paid tribute to those who died in areas of insecurity during the past year.
The ministry explained that the one year anniversary of the creation of the ministry made it necessary to be very firm.
"As we celebrate our first anniversary", she said, "I would like to say that it is time to take a fresh leap forward in our mission".
We need to find ways to expand disaster management, provide relief and provide public assistance that will help us improve our work in the future.

Just as farmers are on the verge of a successful crop in Nigeria, farmers in the Sokoto State area are struggling with the threat of bird attacks, which could threaten the expected crop yield.
The threat of the black-tailed eagle in the Sokoto area of the state of Jharkhand is back, considering that there are signs of a good feeding season in 2020.
Forced, some local farmers adopted a traditional method of chasing the birds as explained by a young man named Faruk from Dange Shuni region.
Sambo Abubakar, one of the local farmers, says that the birds are now destroying all the crops that have begun to sprout in the fields.
The head of the Nigerian Farmers Union Sokoto State Branch, Murtala Gagado Minannata, said that currently two-thirds of Sokoto state is suffering from this problem.
He also said that they are now waiting to hear the situation of local government areas in the state to compile a report to send to the state and federal agriculture ministries to take action to help farmers.
The federal agriculture ministry official in charge of the bird and insecticide department, Yao Maƙeri Kagara, said that the spraying of the insecticide in the Sokoto area was completed in less than a month.
He added that the birds were imported from the Niger republic and Benin, and that international cooperation would be necessary before a joint solution could be found.
In June, the federal government launched a bird-killing operation in 12 northern states of Nigeria that are neighbouring countries through which the birds are imported into Nigeria.

The scheme was launched to alleviate the hardship faced by farmers due to the coronavirus pandemic.
This statement was made by the Minister of Agriculture, Sabo Nanono, during the launch of the program in Katsina.
The announcement was made by the press spokesperson of the Ministry of Agriculture, Ezeaja Ikemefuna, on Thursday.
This initiative will address the devastation that people have experienced due to the Coronavirus pandemic in the country and around the world.
The project will also further stimulate farmers in the development, processing and transportation of food in Nigeria.
The minister reportedly said that the launch event represents over 1,100,000 smallholder farmers across the country.
He said these number of small farmers, over 1 million, 100,000, are part of the Farmers Group which is under the umbrella of 6 companies including AFEX, BabanGona, Value Seeds, Universal, Thrive Agric and Oxfam.
Soon we will also reveal the second group B, those who will benefit from this agricultural program.
Nanono recalled how President Muhammadu Buhari established the Economic Recovery and Promotion Committee from the disabilities it suffered after the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic.
He said one of the ways to revive the country's economy, including the AFJP Programme, would develop agriculture from being a hand-to-hand food-collecting crop to a modern and productive food.
He said the scheme is part of the government's plan to distribute up to 100,000 metric tons of food to the poor to lift them from the grip of food shortages and hunger during the coronavirus pandemic.
He said that within a year this massive program is expected to provide employment to 5 million to 10 million young people.
And it will produce about 10 million metric tons of food per 20,000 to 100,000 hectares per state for at least 2.4 million farmers.

The Kano Civil Society Forum (KCSF), in collaboration with the European Union, the British Council, and the Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption (Rolac) campaign, has launched an awareness campaign on the 2019 Criminal Code.
The event, which was held at the Aminu Kano Centre for Democracy and Extension Research in Mumbai, reviewed the new laws and how they are affecting the society, which was organized by 150 Kano-based civil society organizations and journalists.
Speaking at the closing ceremony, Dr. Nuhu Musa Idris, of the Faculty of Law of Bayero University in Kano, commented on some of the most complex laws.
There he called for a review of some of the outdated laws resulting from the legal trend of the Modern Age.
At his funeral, the head of the Kano State Civil Society Federation (KCSF) Ibrahim Wayya, said that ignorance of the laws played a major role in the violation of the rights of the community and that it is necessary to know how they are.
Some participants of the event, which is the third of its kind to be organized, in the three Kano Senatorial districts, from civil society organizations expressed their views on the legislative process and its message.

The New Law on the Registration of Worship Places is under debate in Nigeria.
The SERAP human rights and economic development group called on President Muhammadu Buhari to reprimand the Nigerian Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami and the Director General at the Registration Board of Kanban to stop the initiative to start registration of places of worship.
According to SERAP, this move is a violation of human rights as enshrined in the Nigerian constitution.
Before human rights groups complained about the government's move, various religious leaders had also raised their concerns with Buhari's government, demanding that the bill be returned to the parliament for review and approval, so that it does not conflict with the constitutional rights of religion and welfare.
Pastor John Buro, a Christian leader in Kaduna state, told Voice of America that the law is baseless, let alone binding, unless the government is trying to ban worship or impose restrictions.
He should simply use the means available to him by monitoring and tracking all lawbreakers without imposing any new law.
For his part, Dr Bashir Yankuzo, rector of Minna University of Science said that while it is not wrong for the government to monitor companies and organizations for national security, this does not mean that strictness will be tolerated and the rights of one or other will be restricted.
It remains to be seen whether the government will listen to this public outcry.

How Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has tried to bring down the PREMIUM TIMES website on the internet.
The Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has taken on a massive cyber-hacking effort to take down the PREMIUM TIMES, the leading online newspaper in Nigeria.
This internet giant has tried all the tricks that hackers use to get into people's websites, but without success.
He first tried hacking on February 28, when he unloaded his malware on the campus of the university, and carried out his attacks using the university's "data".
On the other hand, if he tried to hack into the PREMIUM TIMES database with a computer, he would also attack with his GSM phone.
He spent five days waiting for the door to the PREMIUM TIMES website, but failed, despite using various modern technologies.
He was unsuccessful, because the university did not know that the PREMIUM TIMES had a plan, which built the east gate and the bridge as a door that a small man could not break.
Then PREMIUM has its own superheroes of the modern-day Web Defence including the PREMIUM TIMES War King and the Super Hero, the PREMIUM TIMES Web Defender.
These security officers have the modern expertise in crushing any gang or baron who tries to commit suicide alone, or make a martyr-like attempt to break into the PREMIUM TIMES database.
The following are the types of weapons used by the hacker to attack the PREMIUM TIMES website:
At 8 a.m. he began to slide past the door of the PREMIUM TIMES Museum, only to see how he could sneak in and destroy the entire archive.
He failed overnight, and the next morning, at 6:15 a.m., he tested his luck again, this time by using "WPScan", a technique used to detect the strength or weakness of security measures on large Internet sites such as PREMIUM TIMES.
After 90 minutes, he began his hack with the latest computer technology, "custom script".
It was morning and he made every effort to block PREMIUM TIMES completely through the computer's clogs.
How the Farmer Treated the Monkey's Claw:
The hacker did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had been experimenting with a small mouse and a large city that were entering the farm of their social networking site to shut down the page or take over the website.
This ignorance caused all the fighting equipment he used, mostly old-fashioned ones that could not harm or damage PREMIUM TIMES.
On that day he suffered a lot of pain and fatigue because he had to go through a DDOS attack on the NTP's Likau Valley, which is an old method that has been used since Kano was abandoned.
On March 3, he tried every trick he could think of, but all failed.
The attempt to break into the PREMIUM TIMES Main Archive came days after PREMIUM TIMES published a story about a heated dispute between President Muhammadu Buhari's Defence Advisor, Babagana Monguno and the former Chief of Staff of the Presidential Palace, the late Abba Kyari.
Some members of the Federal University of Technology in Akure, accused PREMIUM TIMES that the university had hired a team of big rats to hack into websites, to hack, corrupt or destroy the PREMIUM TIMES database.
However, PREMIUM TIMES contacted FUTA University, and has been opposed to this attempt to attack the PREMIUM TIMES Internet Archive.
PUTA said that unless it was a simple, uneducated university student who tried it alone, not a PUTA.

As the Kano state government reduced its budget for the current year by about 70 billion naira due to the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the state economy, the state legislature passed a new law to regulate the state government's financial affairs.
However, local opposition groups say that the issue of legislation is a simple one, but its implementation is the challenge.
The creation of a new direction for the democratic administration of public finances is one of the objectives of the new law in Kano State which has been developed in recent years at the federal level and in other states of Nigeria.
The majority leader of the Kano state legislature, Honarabul Kabiru Hassan Dashi, told VOA that the bill will give the ministries and the state government a framework for how they spend their money, as well as how the state will allocate its money.
The local governing bodies have now welcomed the bill, which is subject to frequent review.
The director of the Organization for Community Civic Engagement based in Kano state, Comrade Abdulrazak Alkali said they hope that the government officials, and the state government will implement the law as effectively as possible.
But the Finance and Economic Affairs Commissioner of Kano state Alhaji Shehu Na'Allah said they are well prepared to work with the law.
The new law was signed by Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje last weekend, and is expected to come into force immediately.

Atyap, Hausa-Fulani Reach a Peace Agreement Between Them.
The Atyap, Fulani and Hausa tribal communities residing in the Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State have successfully concluded a mediation conference, in order to create a lasting peace in their region.
The participants, who expressed their determination to achieve peace and mutual understanding, condemned the massacres and the destruction of property that had occurred in their region.
They also announced their intention to help the security agencies with secret information, in order to catch any gangsters hiding in their areas.
The meeting also commended the government's efforts to deploy security forces in the area, and commended the various youth groups above the elders for their show of embracing and avoiding anything that could bring disorder to the region as well as the efforts of their youth to see the successful establishment of this reconciliation agreement between them.
The conference, which was held under the chairmanship of Agwatyap chief Dominic Gambo Yahya, provided a meeting of the three nations, to discuss the possibility of peace.
The meeting was held at the Maryam and Yakubu Ebent Centre in Wakili.
The meeting was also chaired by ABM Stephen Shekari (rty) and Dr. Salim Umar, representing the Atyap dynasty, to seek reconciliation between the communities and stop the bloodshed and waste of property that is being caused between them.
The document was signed by all three Atyap tribal chiefs, Fulani and Hausa, including the late King Agwatyap.
In the 14 paragraph post-conference petition, the residents of Atyap Palace called for someone to take the law into their own hands, instead of complaining to the security authorities.
The meeting also reaffirmed the constitutional guarantee to any Nigerian to live freely in any part of the country where he is needed, including the Atyap Kingdom, without fear or threat from anyone in any form.
The meeting also called on the authorities to expedite the process of returning all the Kingdom's refugees to their homes.
The meeting also proposed the formation of a peace-building committee composed of tribal, Hausa, Fulani and Atyap and their youth to organize large-scale meetings and discussions on security-related issues from time to time to promote peace in their kingdom.
The peaceful demonstration comes hours after the Kaduna State government relaxed the curfew it had imposed in the Zangon Kataf and Kaura districts, of the state to stem the outbreak of violence among the residents.

Just as Ganduje reinstated the princes who had been dismissed by King Ado and Sanusi, he would make them the coroners of Kano.
Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has called on the Kano State Legislative Assembly to amend the state law of 2019, to confirm the appointment of two senior Kano state officials who were resigned by the late King Ado Bayero and King Sanusi, so that the state law would confirm their appointment as the highest-ranking royal appointments in Kano.
The Kano Assembly Speaker, Abdullahi Gafasa, read out Ganduje's request in front of the parliament hall, and it is expected that they will hold a session to discuss the issue before the end of July.
The rulers who were restored to the Kano kingdom were Aminu the Great Ɗan'agundi and, who made Dawaki King Mai Tuta and Kano's Prince, Sanusi Ado-Bayero.
Both were removed by King Ado and King Muhammadu Sanusi, on charges of conspiracy.
The elderly Snowy Dog challenged him in court.
After 17 years of legal battles, the Supreme Court ruled that he was a blasphemer.
He was also the one Ganduje wanted to restore his rule, and in a constitutional amendment he was one of the royal coroners in the Kano kingdom.
Ado Bayero removed Ɗanagundi in 2003 after being convicted of conspiracy and interference in political affairs.
A committee was formed to investigate him, but he was asked to refuse to appear before the committee in order to defend himself.
He then challenged his removal from the Kano State High Court all the way to the Supreme Court.
Before the Supreme Court, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the elder Amino should be reinstated.
But the Kano kingdom under the rule of Muhammadu Sanunmsi II, appealed, with the Supreme Court upholding his removal as the Eastern Governor, and King Dawaki Mai Tuta, on 5 June.
After Sanusi Bayero was removed, Ciroman Kano for refusing to recognize the reign of the Kano Emperor appointed Muhammad Sanusi II in June 2014.
Later he was appointed Chairman of the National Ports Board in Jonathan's day.
He was appointed Wamban Kano, under the current King of Kano.

Li Yaomei, or Sadiya (her Muslim name), is a determined woman who is known for her struggle and success in her struggle to break out of poverty.
Her story tells us that striving, determination, and selfishness are things that come from the heart.
Initially, Li Yaomei or Sadiya, had never sat in a classroom with the intention of taking a lesson, which made it difficult for her to read aloud.
Rather, God gave her a wealth of insight, intelligence, and wisdom, so that she became a role model in fighting poverty.
About 20 years ago, Mrs. Li Yaomei suffered from stomach cancer, which required three operations on her stomach.
After she regained consciousness, she was in a terrible accident, and now she was walking with a metal strap fastened to her leg.
These challenges have left her in a difficult situation not only for her health, but also for the cost of her medical treatment, for which she has taken out a loan of about 3,300 yuan, equivalent to over 16 million Naira.
Surprisingly, Ms. Sadiya's challenge turned into a form of flattery and abuse to try to improve her life.
Then, the Chinese government's support for her was even more encouraging.

In addition, it has developed additional machines that clean the grass and return the locusts.
Then there is the additional machine that purifies her animal feed, and now she even sells these machines to the applicants.
Given the challenges Ms. Sadiya has gone through, and the efforts she still makes to improve her life and that of her staff, it is understandable that the seeker of a wife must have found one.
The fight against poverty and the improvement of living standards are not the sole responsibility of the government.
If the government provides subsidies, but people are not willing or willing to improve their living conditions by finding themselves jobs according to their circumstances, then the backlog will continue without achieving any goal.
Her experience shows that running a business or a lucrative career does not require a large sum of money or travel to other cities or foreign countries.
Because she took into account her circumstances, she used the resources available in her area to improve her life.
Moreover, the teacher Sadiah performed these tasks on her own without the help of her husband, who had run away from her.
In other words, hard work, determination, and selfishness are things of the heart.
He then showed the power of women to change their lives and stand on their own two feet.
This is also a lesson in the importance of being steadfast in all that you do, for trust in someone else is uncertain.
Madam Sadiah was indeed a determined, intelligent and intelligent woman who became an example and a role model for others.
Also, as of March this year, Ms. Sadiya has completed the payment of all her debts, and has stopped receiving government subsidies on her own.

There is a fear that US politicians will undermine efforts to contain COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Recently, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed concern over the efforts of some countries to stockpile and produce COVID-19 respiratory vaccine, saying that there should be no preference for different populations, while the vaccine is being distributed.
And the vaccine should be distributed in an equitable manner across the world, as this would be in the best interest of different countries.
Indeed, some US politicians are implementing a self-serving policy of vaccine sharing, and are also undermining international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide has already exceeded 23 million.
More than 800,000 people died from the disease.
Under such critical conditions, attention is increasingly focused on the effectiveness of vaccines, and fortunately, in recent times, there have been significant results in vaccine trials in some countries, which has generated hope, and confidence in the international community as a whole.
But sadly, some US politicians have expressed a desire to take the vaccine.
The magazine "Science" even clarified that the US government has already signed contracts to buy COVID-19 vaccines worth over $6 billion from several pharmaceutical companies.
While the U.S. government's intent is well understood, with the United States being the leading cause of the spread of the virus, other developing countries are also in dire need of vaccines, given that they are most vulnerable to shortage of health resources.
"The Ecologist" also points out that if the United States reaches the vaccine production target, the supply of vaccines to developing countries will decline.
The director general of the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed concern over the issue.
As some commentators have pointed out, even if the vaccine is successfully developed, it is not possible to achieve the post-pandemic goal of a standardized vaccine distribution, which is a matter of great international concern.
And it is necessary for the international community to strengthen cooperation between them.
WHO Director-General Tedros also pointed out that, if the pandemic is to be seen, it must be contained from all sectors across the globe, while it is not possible for some parts of the world, or a few countries to achieve the goal of recovery from their own pandemic effects alone.

Nigeria is experiencing the worst economic downturn this year.
Published on: August 24, 2020 at 16:33.
The Nigerian Bureau of Statistics announced that the country's economy has experienced the worst recession in the last 10 years, as a result of a recession that exceeded the 6 percent recorded between April and June of this year.
The figures released by the Commission today show that between April and June, as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdown of daily activities, the Nigerian economy entered a state that has never been seen between 2010 and 2020.
The agency listed the reasons behind the crisis including forced lockdowns across the country, traffic restrictions, air travel restrictions and closure of schools and businesses.
The agency added that such international measures have caused the price of oil to plummet, while the international industry has been shut down due to the crisis.
Last May, Nigeria's Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed said the Statistics Authority had predicted a similar situation, as a result of these problems that hampered day-to-day operations, forcing the government to tighten its budget.

Minister of Niger Delta Development in Nigeria, Godswill Akpabio has revealed the names of the legislators who have been awarded contracts by the NDDC to run several major projects.
This comes at a time when the leaders of the Niger Delta Regional Development Commission (NDDC) are being accused of embezzling funds.

The documents released by Akpabio, show that most of the contracts were awarded in 2018, but the amount of money spent on their operation was not disclosed.

Yobe Spends More Than N78.8m on Recovery of Leda - Leadership Hausa Newspapers
The efforts of the Yobe State Government, under Governor Mai Mala Buni in reviving the state-owned Yobe state Polythene Bag and Woben sacks Company, after more than 10 years of inactivity, were lauded.
This was stated by the General Manager, Engineer Sha'aibu Adamu Gadaka, in his interview with our representative at his office in Damaturu, the capital of Yobe State, earlier this week.
He said the company had been locked down for over 10 years, but after the arrival of Governor Buni it was hard to be determined to revive it, who immediately ordered the withdrawal of N78.8 million to repair the essential parts of the company with an additional N48 million to be managed, while allowing the company to stand on its feet.
Eng. Gadaka further explained that this enabled them to purchase the necessary materials for starting the company, including the new 500 KbA generator, 500 KbA power distribution machine, new bag leather machine, bag sewing machine and other equipment required by the company.
