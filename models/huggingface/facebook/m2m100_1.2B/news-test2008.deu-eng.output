Food to blame European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation in the euro area is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, prices were higher than expected in November - after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only 3 percent, Bloomberg.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the key interest rate; in its discretion, the reduction of interest rates would favor the rise in commodity prices and the slight decrease in unemployment to create an inflationary spiral.
The ECB is striving to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in a mess: one has to “counter” inflation in order to rule out the need for later action.
In November, the inflation rate reached a record twelve-year high in Germany at 3.3 percent; in Spain, the rate rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
The rise in inflation in the Eurozone is driven by rising food and energy prices.
MATIF wheat listings rose by 88 percent, and the price for soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant price increase in food oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price of crude oil rose 52 percent this year – last month the price per barrel of black gold reached $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next three to four months, analysts expect an inflation rate of 3 percent, but the average annual rate is 2.1 percent.
Experts predict that the ECB will cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup faces government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz supporters has increased significantly until early December.For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the support for the Socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
Among the party-loyal voters, the difference is evident thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) of the support for the MSZP.
According to the survey, the MDF and the SZDSZ are under the parliamentary entry barrier: they reach two percent of the total population.
The number of voters in both camps increased by one percent.
Compared to the last low, the overall economic mood has deteriorated further – never before has the proportion of those who assess the country’s economic situation as “expressively bad” been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider them “pretty bad.”
After more hopeful outlook in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only one-tenth expect an improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents — a historic high — rated the prime minister’s work as “rather bad than right.”
Thirteen percent of respondents generally have a high level of confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the proportion of supporters of Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Approximately 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% who do not trust the leader of the Fidesz party.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who think that one could manage the dissatisfaction with the prime minister even without a change of government.
After the riots in October last year, 35% still voted for the remainder of the government and the head of government, today this percentage is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
When asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent answered that they would "certainly" participate, and another 20 percent would "likely" vote.
For comparison, if the parliamentary elections were held this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the polls "with certainty", another 15% consider their participation "likely".
74% would vote against the tuition fee, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital daily fee.
Based on the group of people "with certainty" who participated in the referendum, the proportions of opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84 and 89 percent, respectively.
Auchan the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörser Trade Area haveined the average price increase of 16% from last year this year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser trading triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, however, in all hypermarkets price increases of over 1000 HUF have been recorded.
After the prices in the food markets “devolved” last December, the price rate has not dropped drastically, compared to the already high, previous starting level.
However, it is deterrent to consumers that what they had paid much less than 9,000 HUF for last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets investigated.
The highest price was 10573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6 800 HUF.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year’s level, while prices for Putenbrustfilets, Nuts and Peanuts have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread matched the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but with Auchan there was 1 kg of bread for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price drop for the product below 200 forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two-litre Coca-Cola bottle of less than 200 forints, so the drink including the deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison, Auchan was the most expensive, and Cora was the cheapest.
Our calculations revealed that Cora increased prices in the "Napi" shopping cart by 15 percent compared to Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan increased prices by 18 percent, respectively.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart last year and the most expensive one today was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart last year and the most expensive one this year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1480.00 HUF.
The average price increase last year was still 1.206,00 forints, but the increase in VAT was noticeable in the prices of last Christmas.
It was precisely this process that hit the trade: apparently, the stores could not correctly decide which price range to apply to the individual items, because the effects of price increases on consumer behaviour were unpredictable.
(If the trader is poorly planning the speed of a product’s circulation, he may fall for substantial gains in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price of the "Napi" shopping basket fell so radically last year that the most expensive basket exceeded the 2006 value by 1720 forints, while the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1.630,00 forints more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1.284,00 forints.
In comparison to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, the price of daily consumer goods in the hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office found a more than 30% price increase over a 12-month period.
Same with eggs as well.)
However, if you look into the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the already expensive product, even in the worst case, has risen by barely more than 10 percent.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the hurry suppliers - after all, they were able to turn the drastic price increase to the multis.
In the golden trading triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; there are continuous reports of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three stores no longer look at prices.
It is purchased in large quantities from everything, durable food goes in pallets over the counter tables.
Wednesday morning in the morning there were endless serpents at the box office in all three stores, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer rate is by the country, so many multis complain to opinion researchers that they could not even reach the planned turnover, not only in food, but also in sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved.
Last year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to improper treatment of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overcrowding of the staff - all factors that are not exactly conducive to the curbing of infections, according to the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of the János Hospital, a MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
There was a similar infection at the beginning of the year.
The injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but a short time later the man had to return with an MRSA infection.
As of December 10, this year, 1094 infections triggered by multi-resistant pathogens from hospitals were to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections triggered by multi-resistant pathogens have been recorded in hospitals, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their nose without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as angina, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the funds are overdosed or used incorrectly, the well-responsive bacteria form antibiotic-resistant bacteria that spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently malfunctioning immune systems, but also in the elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical head of the János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the daily life of the hospital.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi warned – MRSA only does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the care staff wears rubber gloves and masks at the care, and we have the necessary antibiotics for treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are examined for MRSA when they are taken to the hospital, an infection can not always be avoided.
Testing too rarely
The majority of MRSA-induced infections in hospitals could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for curbing the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant agent, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is prevalent in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the hospitalized patients and immediately isolate those infected with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not so frequently practiced in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no subsidies from the state health fund for this examination.
Most cases therefore come to light only when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical head of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are necessary to prevent resistance to the agent, but this directive is not always complied with by hospitals.
Among ambulatory or primary care patients, microbiological sampling is even more rare, says Karolina Böröcz.
Saving on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transmitted from one patient to another by caregivers.
This is why handwashing, or wearing gloves and masks, is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by dropless infection or contact, but in domestic hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even often crowded, the beds are roughly aligned, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the financially less well-positioned hospitals, it even happens that disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections are shown to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes enormous costs to health insurance companies, so they are fighted everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its mitigation, was included in the government program.
At first signs, the program is successful - as published data shows, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) as one of its priorities, as well as prevention of infections in hospitals.
The police officer was not drunk.
In the case of the fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII. district, the official opinion is now available.
The now retired police chief of the 22nd district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor under the influence of drugs, Attila Morvai, the press spokesman for the Budapest High Prosecutor’s Office, said on Friday after the official opinion on the case was submitted.
The assessment confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before taking the wheel.
The former police chief, in his own car in the 22nd district, crashed into the street of Kossuth Lajos, crossing a 55-year-old man across the street in an unmarked place.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the driver has subordination, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the Zebr Strip.)
The pedestrian died of his injuries after being taken to the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then resigned from his functions and applied for retirement.
The Budapest Prosecutor’s Office has launched an investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements for a total of EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a €300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects with grants from the Cohesion Fund.
The €150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be used for the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has allocated a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contractual partners have signed an agreement of €50 million, which will flow mainly into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
The subway line 4 was also discussed.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of subway financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be discussed again.
According to Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest rates are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with a delay of 8 years, commission free.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe is looking attentively at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys in the still cheapest market in the EU, which is becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most sought-after place for real estate purchases in the Eastern European area, with affordable ski apartments and seaside houses.
Among the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, along the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the runners, however, real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to estimates of Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria wid also attract domestic investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the highly favorable area of Russian recorded more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - commercial and office spaces offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on its best path to becoming one of the most attractive European golf havens, thereby attracting tourists in the other two seasons in addition to the summer and winter season.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying in large-scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria also aim to change their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle either buy revitalized properties for 50-100,000 euros, or shattered houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are well-written, but also the proximity to a large city, shops and doctors are crucial for buyers.
The second category includes those looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest with the goal of increasing value in the medium to long term.
However, real estate in the capital is becoming more expensive due to the ever-increasing demand.
In the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years there has been an annual price increase of 21 percent.
The price increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are consulting on the Bali Roadmap, which sets out emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a fierce debate between industrialized and developing countries.
The U.S. has already signaled that it is not willing to negotiate concrete figures, but is willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question of the conference is whether developed countries are willing to support developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on supporting developing countries.
The Adjustment Fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, likely through the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as will be read in the "Piac és Profit".
6 percent of Hungary
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports, on behalf of Hungary, the EU’s efforts to maintain its leadership in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured at 1990 values), regardless of whether or not the "Agreement after 2012" is successful.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the target of the countries that had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, while the EU with its then 15 member states had already committed to a reduction of 8 percent.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 – a requirement that the country will quite fulfill, as read in the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The commitment is high on Bali – after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would not enter into force after 2012. In this case, a new international emission reduction system would not follow the reduction goal set out in the Kyoto Protocol, the importance of which was also highlighted by the IPCC, the international, Nobel Peace Prize-winning scientific climate change committee of the UN in its recent report.
This would delay the reduction of emissions, and an increase in global average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army Advertising on YouTube
Units of the British army have posted footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban to the network since March 2006.
The footage, filmed with miniature cameras attached to helmets, will be checked at the air force base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where it will be posted on the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under the Defence Headquarters in the spring of 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the British Foreign Office and the International Peace Forces stationed in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Operations in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force released the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual goals of foreign missions.
This kind of public propaganda is almost free compared to traditional television advertising, according to defence expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message, as they confirm the legitimacy of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans Advertise with Games
But the army must also fight against amateur footage, which it also puts on the net in addition to the carefully edited, censored footage - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are mostly talked about, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
From the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, by the way, numerous videos shot in operation have already been uploaded to the platform, but this "genre" has only recently been discovered by the British for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free-to-download shooter "America's Army", in which the player can slide into the skin of the soldier as part of a more or less vivid simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour, Mónika Lamperth, is not uncomfortable: Instead of a Christmas celebration, she organizes a work conference where her employees can fill the year with coffee and chopsticks.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others enchant Christmas atmosphere with tombola or blowing into the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet – this is how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already captured the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held this year in the defence department, but the ministry staff are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas Feast of the Orphans" children are gifted by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission Feast" family members of soldiers currently stationed abroad are hosted, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department will allocate around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport are over the lines.
The Ministry of Economy’s 4.32 million Forint Christmas celebration will be held in the House of the Future, with approximately 350 of the 600 employees expected.
While the focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a Tombola draw.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million Forint Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the State Council of Justice (OIT), with concerts and a feast dinner.
The salary amounted to 1 million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ has also been invited to another Christmas party organized by the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG Zrt) with EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information, as we have not reached the responsible persons.
Why the costume?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFU, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 people attended the ball.
The ceremonies were opened with a speech by the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] it was that there was no ball dress or costume obligation on the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour, and Self-Government are each preparing for puritan celebrations.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for employees in its own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is officially inviting her employees not to a Christmas party at all, but to a conference for the end of the year.
One expects about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - will be hosted only with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration is 350,000 forints.
Minister of self-government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply strike in the ministry hall.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is hosting a Christmas party in its own festival hall, to which 436 employees are expected to attend.
The expenditure was measured at 2500 forints per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent push.
Since the beginning of János Veres’ term, PM staff have celebrated this every year.
However, there will not be a proper party mood - not only because of the official speech of the minister, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites to a New Year’s reception on January 20, the Ministry’s Christmas celebration falls out this time.
One hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the town park ("Városliget"); according to the information of the resort, the expenses are measured at 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple standing reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held each year, traditionally begin with a brief address by the Minister and sound with a restrained squeeze.
As the corresponding press outlets report on request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Ministry of Education.
Asked about the cost of the Christmas celebration, the press department of the Ministry of Environment could not provide information.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is being held at the Museum of Commercial Art.
More and more people mobilize for massive strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation of Trade Unions will form their coordination committee on Friday for an indefinite strike starting on Monday.
A large protest assembly will be held on Saturday, and on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the work deployment begins.
Strike-related, significant traffic barriers are expected as railway traffic is almost completely shut down, and also the Budapest public transport operators (BKV) strike until 13 a.m.
Details of the strike will be announced on Friday afternoon by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be established, which will be responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A major protest assembly will be held on Saturday, and from Monday on, all organizations that have joined the strike will cease work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike that began on the day of parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that there will be a vote on the Health Insurance Act only late in the evening, or even only at midnight.
As a result of the strikes starting on Monday, there will be significant traffic barriers: railway workers stop work indefinitely, the majority of public transport and more than half of Volán companies stop in the morning.
At the same time, there will be motorway blockages in many places.
The call to strike has been followed by numerous unions and civil society organizations - the list of participants is updated on the League website.
Some organizations have announced unlimited strikes, while others are planning a temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement was reached between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Railway Trade Union VDSZSZ on sufficient services, despite the fact that more and more people are traveling by rail during Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV will run from start to 13 a.m., at Budapest Airport from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat will suspend work for four hours, and the Teachers’ Union and the Democratic Teachers’ Union have called for a 2- or 2-8 hour strike.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes nationwide alternately at various times, while the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and presents a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
The third requirement is that eligible occupational groups have access to the early retirement scheme before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer for the secondary lines submitted by the Ministry of Transport and is now demanding a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to Political Capital’s Risk Analysis Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, established in August with the support of the “Movement for a Better Hungary”, have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute’s “Risk Warning Report” states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the “exacerbating of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsies and non-Gypsy populations in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term”.
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is likely aimed at provoking such a confrontation, according to the research institute.
As, this is viewed as a failure by the political leaders: “Personages of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups, who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary contrast.”
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favor extremes, and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, "significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
Since the fall of 2006, the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary has been continuously on the rise, so that since the summer of 2007 several organizations have been founded, calling themselves "national self-defense associations".
“It is common to these groups that they each define themselves as a civilian organization, while they openly boast of preparing their members for – sometimes armed – defence tasks (disaster protection, national defence, order maintenance), citing the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself,” it said.
All this should be done in accordance with the method which seeks to disguise as a civil initiative various political aspirations based on the political and party disorientation of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of association is therefore not only meant to circumvent legal obstacles that could arise in the course of registration in court – it is also a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard also pose a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited in several neighboring countries as a potential source of danger, so some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighboring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as a confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region,” he said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard were the mass Roma riots that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents as an occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the goal of the organization is “national protection.”
In her opinion, in the past 17 years, a real “Gypsy terror” was felt in Bulgaria, but the state remained inactive and indifferent.
And further: the initiative would have sparked a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
As the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that Hungarian Roma will also respond to the threats by organising their own protection, according to the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital said at the request of the news office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually, and should risk-changing trends be detectable, the public opinion would be informed, as in the case by issuing the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere.
In Hungary, holidays are strictly regulated by law, so the practice of changing working days around holidays has now established itself, but the coming year will give us fewer such days.
In the United States and in the United States, the term holiday is also used in a different way.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and public holidays.
Working days are mostly church holidays, or are related to major historical events.
We also celebrate New Year, for example: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are working-free days - the latter alone allows the New Year's Eve celebrants to rest.
We have a total of 14 holidays throughout the year.
The national holidays are March 15, commemorating the revolution of 1848, and October 23, commemorating the revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August we celebrate the founding of the state, on the 1st of May we celebrate the work, and on the 1st and 2nd of November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each to Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of “workday postponement” has proven in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of prolonged weekends, however, is that we have to work very comfortably on Saturdays before it, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finally completed, has been determined by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employers, public servants and officials of the public service.
Exceptions are only companies and institutions in which the operation continues without interruption, i.e. also on public holidays.
Currently, the working order is only a bit confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life here is still formally standing, as most people take time balancing for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the holiday specially abolished for it.
Next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer shifts on working days than this year.
The calendar is first "set on the head" around the working day so that people can stay at home for just four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so Friday, May 2 may be a rest day.
The second disposal is related to the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, you will have to work ahead of Friday, 24 October.
The end of the year, however, will be completely in the sign of holidays, after starting on December 24, everything remains still, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six Deterrent Little Things to Anger Working Colleagues
E-mails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive – harmless lies that don’t even notice us anymore: they bring “color” to everyday life at work.
The question is only whether you get used to these small inconveniences, or you better face the challenge and try to consciously avoid these misunderstood, for other annoying situations.
and tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to address you that someone from the marketing department called," says one colleague.
Did you miss a meeting?
At best, you’ll regret it and try to fix it, by calling the marketing department and repentingly confessing that you’d forgotten to target the message (that’s the less common method).
This is usually accompanied by an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should think about what you can do to give your colleagues truly unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Borrowing something that is not yours.
There’s hardly anything more nervous than catching up for a document, office accessory, or phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the stick was still on the desk – is it gone this morning?
Or is the lost bulletboard believed to be found on a colleague’s desk?
Without asking questions, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they will be rightly upset when they find that something has gone away.
So, don’t put any envelope or post-it from the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: no more there if you need it urgently.
About the personal life of your colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a mess that has already been put into the world.
Who with whom, what done?
Where and why?
One should not bind the information (or assumptions) about the private life of colleagues to everyone’s nose, if possible!
And if someone opens up and reveals to us his innermost secret, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave, rather than address the person who is not present, even if others are aware of the problems of the colleague.
Sick for no reason?
When you call in the office to report illness with reference to tormenting headaches, because you are just feeling uncomfortable, or simply want to rest, one should be clear about one thing: Your own work, delayable deals, projects with fixed dates must now be done by your colleagues instead of yourself.
Do not play badly with colleagues.
If you already know the day before that you will not be able to get to the office the next day, or that something might interfere with it and you need to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Tagged, phone calls, phone calls
You’re getting deeper in your work, but you’re suddenly disturbed by the loud gaze of your colleagues?
Do you have an unwanted phone call that you shouldn’t have heard?
One should not nerve the colleagues with summaries, singing, loud conversations (which one leads through their heads), trampolines, constant blasphemy or nerds.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if you are not exactly immersed in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the blame for your forgetfulness in others!
If possible, you should not excuse yourself for the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others were affected.
The question of how to repair the mistake, or repair the missed, is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training pants and sleeping: comfortable for home, but nothing lost in the office!
You shouldn’t even dress so loose if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get too sluggish - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, also beautiful and elegant!
Want to Make It Right to Everyone - or How to Become Uninteresting to Others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the all-morning congestion.
From the radio comes a strange melody: the sound of a violin, coupled with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It’s the song “Wings of Love” by Zagar that sounds on mr2.
The local music scene has long not really spoiled us with high-quality electropop.
But now you can even see the congestion differently when you listen to Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and exciting production from the domestic digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even when the garage coat with its guitar squirrel is back "in", the domestic electropop proves: There is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, musicalized himself in the band Yonderboi before he – because a hostel can’t tolerate two pebbles – began to walk his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which merged elements from jazz, electronics, and pop, he did not succeed, but only when he was approached with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
“Szezon” by Ferenc Török
The band, which had originally performed in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums, and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, made it the almost only marketable trendsetter in the West.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one cared if they liked to wear this brand.
The band has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album titled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The term originates from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying reference would be fine, but in addition to the etheric character of the music, the louder guitar, corresponding to the spirit of the times and trends, the influences of rock’n’roll, appear.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere in the Millenáris.
One song from the album has even made it a radio hit – Mr2 Petőfi, who has been broadcasting pop music from early to late since then, has successively brought the listeners to the ear with the song "Wings of Love", recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is OK (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: to what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term “layered music” does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be thin and untelling, but they can only be produced for sale, which makes them commercial music.
Even a good pop number can arise from an honest theme.
The listener’s readiness also works according to this principle, regardless of languages and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially in the west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
Not only teenagers or twins go to concerts, but also the elderly audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them, much more attentively, because they also consider them to be a part of contemporary culture.
HVG.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many people listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it’s a good feeling to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
We never composed for the market.
Music is not made for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is mostly felt in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but it exists only in the immeasurable changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I noticed one thing: If you want to make it all right, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He travels as a soloist and has built his career rather in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, despite the fact that we are constantly trying to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves more like team players who trust in each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In mr2 Petőfi’s charts, “Wings of Love” stands first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a slightly more popular style deliberately staged towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We didn’t have any plans to write a hit that would then serve as a trail horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was meant as the final of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound orgia and the slightly more difficult topics.
How did you choose the six singers?
Why exactly you, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of assembling the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene.
Thus the six-person choir – Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh – which we then baptized underground divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls make it?
B. Zs.: The number had been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this number still “needed something.”
The chord sequence formally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they taught the girls.
Everything came in a very spontaneous and frightening way.
I remember I was quite electrified at the time, but it already needed the "Divas."
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, there was the impression that the girls were in the background.
There’s no solo part (except for Judy Jay’s short solo), they don’t have their own role, they sing perfectly together and aren’t louder than the music, so their singing isn’t just accompanied by the music.
They also stood behind the stage.
Is it intention?
B.Zs.: That they stood behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we did not want to give them solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting a little about our ego, forgetting who came from where and where we are on our way, simply allowing these particular wings, the wings of love, to raise us.
I would like others to feel the euphoria we felt when the song was made.
Q: What was the most exciting song?
B. Zs.: In the musical creative work, there was actually no, there were more difficult tasks in the mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything came together, like a puzzle.
Q: What is your favorite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: That’s changing with the concerts and even now that I’ve released the album.
Currently, they are "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the song "Never The Same".
Fraud broker risked billions because of inferiority feelings
Undisputed fraudsters
This is how his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, calls the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the local Komerční banka.
It cost him 5 billion euros.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to do the same to his colleagues, and was not incompetent.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He is mentally rather weak," was to be heard from the mouth of his superiors, who him to the police.
However, according to Kerviel’s statements, published by French media, such as the daily Le Monde, he was a man who had made profits of €1.6 billion with his business at the end of last year.
Not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros just from the American crisis.
This opportunity had been forgotten at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were initial reports that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had problems with payments in the past, would be in trouble.
This crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel did not believe it and was right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I earned the first half a billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel admits, continuing to say that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the interrogation, he admitted that he had falsified documents so that he could not be arrested.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Eurex exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk Profit
Was he afraid to fly?
Hardly.
"I thought she satisfied the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he get the courage to take such risks?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years, he was already an assistant of a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Nevertheless, he knew he would never earn as much as others.
“When I first spoke in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigative officer.
But soon after his entry came the first big success.
With the shares of the Alliance he earned a lot by wagering half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger – now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we will let you
“It’s like a snowball,” he told the police officer.
But the bosses supposedly knew of everything, or suspected it.
“As long as I earned money, people closed their eyes.”
But then, at the beginning of this year, the big blow came.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
In a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to compensate for that.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
How did they get to him?
Suspiciously, he went on vacation.
“I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn’t take a vacation is one who doesn’t want to be looked at in his cards,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes, through which the Czech Republic can generate €14 billion (about €365 billion) in the coming years.
This is about half the amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately SEK 125 billion will come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will receive approximately 100 billion SEK from the "Entrepreneurship and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, approximately 150 billion, will be spent on the expansion of transport.
The transport program is the largest development program and covers up to 22 percent of the funding that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money increases accordingly the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have at its disposal next year over 90,8 billion.
The “Entrepreneurship and Innovation” programme aims to help entrepreneurs and companies raise funds for innovative enterprises.
The companies will thus gain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
In the previous acquisition of funds from EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the least successful among the new accession countries so far.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20-year prison sentence for former president
A Nicaraguan appeal court on Thursday confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to $100 million (nearly SEK 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest at his Hazienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (from 1997 to 2002) of this Central American state will come back behind bars is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the chairman of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detainees whether Alemán will be sentenced at home or whether he will have to go to jail.
A court found four years ago that Alemán regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of that money eventually went to a fund that Alemán had set up to fund his 2001 election campaign.
The budget is through
Yes, it is done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget drafted by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
For the current year, it was still approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats), because it had been submitted by Minister Sobotka (of that party), and the ČSSD could therefore not afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no confidence against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives calmly passed this traditionally little-respected, yet highly significant law.
This is somehow paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, which is why they pay more attention to it.
A dispute between politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
In the past social-democratic governments, the state budgets suffered from three weaknesses that the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high percentage of expenditure that is mandatory by law, not only for pensions, but also for social expenditure, which was decided by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit fiscal policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat controlled.
But a real time bomb is the municipal budget deficit.
Many mayors, in order to open up other sources of investment in addition to income from taxes, taxes and bank loans, often imprudently issued bonds by which they overdue their council houses.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts by mass sales of shares in energy and other supply networks, which they had received from the state in the course of privatization.
This source has already been removed.
As far as we only stick to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
For several years, our economy, like the rest of the world, has gone through a phase of growth that the ČSSD always boasts.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put their public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owe the state even more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have been much more reasonable than our republic.
This is a huge shame, attributable primarily to the previous governments.
We are among the countries that are the least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have just in recent years been superfluously blown up on a gigantic scale.
Even though it has succeeded in removing some of the nonsensical populist spending that was passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no postponement of the retirement age and a pension reform in the near future, then virtually any policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, nothing will remain to him but pure management.
It is easily exaggerated to say that then from ruling politicians to civil servants, who mechanically divide the majority of tax revenues into pensions and social spending.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be a revolution, it can only stop the suppression of normal spending by mandatory spending.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns planned for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not spent what they could in the past decade.
If we don’t really want ruling politicians to become pure administrative officials, then we have to be patient and wish this not too strong coalition government, who is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take in taxes and fees, rest in preparing further reform laws.
Only these will enable the gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will go to the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to lend money to each other.
For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve will be auctioning $40 billion, with another $24 billion for the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 9/11 that national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated approach to defending or mitigating the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This move is aimed at eliminating the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing shortage of freely available capital that banks can lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group in a report to his clients.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unsuccessful loans, mostly in the United States.
Analysts expect additional billions of dollars.
"The central banks must have really been afraid of what could happen when they decided to take this approach," said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession, potentially affecting economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided to do so after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used for lending money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, despite the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom having lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as further lowering interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks contributes to the warming up of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists’ debates are incredible
Global climate change isly harming developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now refers to the UN’s upcoming international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book A blue, not a green planet, he concluded that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which forms a strange mixture of government representatives and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word firework that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that the subject matter is very important to him and that he is therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appears in German translation because “I often encounter cartoons of my views.”
Now interested parties can read his attitude without distortion.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist, but he believes he has sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
After all, he is an academic, able to understand and evaluate technical theses, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he called the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not too large and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptably expensive.
Furthermore, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, he sees this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against “a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the ratio between effort and yield.”
On the same topic Klaus had spoken in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driving license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to replace their old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for the exchange so that authorities can issue a new driver’s license by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not concerned that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will go to the streets without a valid driving license.
According to the authorities, mostly those who do not want to drive have not changed their driving license.
While small towns report a sharp decline in interest in driving license exchange, the capital’s offices are overwhelmed with applications, and interest in the exchange continued to grow this week.
The city administration handles around 2,000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not changed their driving licenses yet.
The issuance of a new driver’s license will take 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a reduced period of five days.
In this case, the driver will have to pay £500.
Drivers who fail to perform the prescribed replacement by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver’s license will be subject to fines from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police may also have a warning in the case of the violation.
In the event of a breach, the penalty can be increased to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, even the one who does not drive at all can be punished by the municipality.
He could face a fine of up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has already called on the authorities to keep mild and impose a fine of no more than 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a thousand crown fine.
A driver’s license is a document where everyone can decide whether they want to own it or not.
This is not a personal identity card that everyone needs to have, namely a valid one.
People who do not want to drive should give up their driving license.
It is enough to bring him to the competent municipal office or send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will be void.
However, drivers are gradually having to change other types of driving licenses as well.
People with driving licenses from 1994 to 2000 have three years to change.
Driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional driving licenses.
Court reduces penalties for detectives allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of joining the gang of David Berdych, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Oberlandesgericht, which reduced their sentence by one or two years respectively.
Initially, the detectives of the "Office for Combating Organized Crime" were threatened with 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal against today’s judgment, only revision at the Supreme Court.
Berdych himself is also charged in this case, but he will face the first-instance judgment.
In other trials, however, he had already received sentences of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be condemned any more.
A district court found 19 people guilty in January mainly for involvement in robberies, the Oberlandesgericht dealt with the appeal of 16 of them today.
Most accused have denied the charges from the outset on the grounds that it is a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, police officers in consultation with Berdych, among others, handed over information from police sources to criminals, covered up various robberies and helped members of the gang to escape prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the prey.
The charges are based on crimes committed by the gang between 1999 and 2001.
Especially the robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious injuries, but also the impunity and unlawful possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel nuclei, a laser distance target tube and a machine gun.
The gang has, according to the accusation, enriched itself by its robberies by many million crowns.
In addition to 20 men in this trial, the courts finally found Berdych and a number of others guilty of further robberies.
Other men from Berdych's district must be held accountable in a different trial, other cases have not yet come to court.
The main trial has so far escaped Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody and await the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the confusion of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, is demanding compensation of 12 million crowns plus court costs from the hospital in Třebíč.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million, and for the children one million.
The hospital provides a maximum of $200,000 for each parent.
Therefore, the hospital’s legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, does not agree with Velebas’s proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," Dostál said after today's negotiation.
“But in order to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the expert opinion that the counterparty produced.
We will see if it is worth it at all.
But we insist that this should be within the range of hundreds of thousands for all,” Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should range between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At first, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month they had not raised their biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an expert opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
According to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms of varying severity and depth.
The men tolerated the stressful situation better, even though they faced accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, get worse off with the after-effects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is happening right now, Veleba summed up the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the maternity clinic in Třebíč on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the head of the district of Vysočina (Bohemian-Moravian Heights) gave each family 100,000 crowns as a compensation for the expenses incurred by them due to the fault of the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability.
In case of doubt, they must resort to a reserve fund, only in exceptional cases can they request assistance from the institution.
So far, the courts have granted the victims comparatively low amounts of damages, the amounts were determined by tables and ranged in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptions of millions.
Polívka came for his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the "Kingdom of Walachei" brand.
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, although he was the first to use the term "Walachish King", the project had in many years of work built up a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor.
Polívka did not attend the hearing today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to parasitically participate in Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the hearing.
Everyone imagined this actor and comedian with the words "Walachic kingdom".
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
“We have 10 years of work behind us.
fundraising and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause is a dispute over money.
“After years, they have noticed that the project is successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to parasitically gain from our work,” he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Walachish King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At that time, however, this was not related to the intention of establishing a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing walachian passports.
From an initially fun action, a business and entrepreneurial activity crystallized, to which Harabiš then joined the establishment of the company "Walish Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also argued today that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka made public in the show "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"Polívka's popularity has helped the project of the walachian kingdom," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team who had been intensely devoted to it.
The cooperation of the now-disputed parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to accumulate, culminating in the dissolution "King Boleslav I. elected until St. Nimmerlein's Day".
The leadership role was then assumed by Harabiš's suggestion Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clearness in the dispute could bring the competition prepared by Harabiš for the throne and a half princess.
A new king should emerge.
He has not yet revealed any details and a date.
“We do not want to rush.
It should be something like the king's move in the Walachei.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Polívka can also sign up," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: advance parts disappear
To be honest, I’ve never been a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much worthwhile, the quality of the gearbox, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The combi with the name SW is a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207 I had to complain about the lack of head space on the rear seats, for example.
These complaints are no longer there, because the body of the car is designed so that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Fast forward
I will go through the interior only briefly, so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a pretty successful design, where I only have objections because of the troubling middle tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design design where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times when we may have complained about too short seats or head supports are over.
The page content has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As for the space offering, the increased dimensions of the body can also be felt here.
In the combination, the already mentioned lack of head freedom is also eliminated.
A suitcase in the luggage.
But the main thing about this car is the cargo space.
I have to call it (also because of the foldable rear window) very loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with holders, which are an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be pulled apart and hold even heavier objects.
But let’s talk about the load volume.
According to the table, it is 428 liters in the basic equipment, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the most sold car in the Czech Republic of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot lags behind by a marked 52 liters.
For a vacation abroad or when inviting a car, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positive, I still have to mention the very flat load space after folding the rear seats or also the very low load edge.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline engine with a volume of 1.6 liters and a power of 88 kWp.
And frankly, this is what a 1600 cubic engine should look like to drive a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him to his Škoda counterpart, which sometimes seems as if his exhaust is blocked with a blade, then I can only be excited about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
But we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400s petrol engine in the amount of 329900 krona is still going on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car strikes again with 80,000 crowns in addition to book.
We, however, had kopfairbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic discwashing, electric window lifts at the back and...
The total cost of the car is 531900 kronor.
That’s a lot, but count the extra equipment of a Fabia together and you’ll arrive at a very similar amount.
Therefore, it remains only to decide which brand to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools fails
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, raising fears among locals about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far faced a number of obstacles.
British schools even record cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of indigenous inhabitants are increasing in violence.
The problem with the integration of Eastern European children in British schools is a good example of the case of North Kent, where clashes between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment and bullying among students have spread to the relationships between parents.
The situation has evolved to such an extent that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a 10-year-old boy with a iron rod.
The accused defended herself by insulting her with racist insults.
Police were also forced to intervene after an attack by two minor girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks about the man and threw him stones.
“When we went home, a boy climbed on a bush and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw us apples and pearls and then exposed his ass," a mother of Slovak students told The Times of another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The aforementioned cases indicate that the atmosphere between locals and immigrants at British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks are to have come here in search of work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba – the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will come true if you just choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters serving pizza, ice cream and enchanting cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you can find this in abundance.
But there is only one island you can find a lot more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the late 20th century.
It was built by one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the Prohibition) was liked and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew, across the wide boulevards, cars that were among the cult symbols of the 1950s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today ?
On the walls of the Bodeguita in Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails for you as you wish.
And the cult cars of the 1950s drive around Havana to this day, because the once imported shigulis and fiats have long since broken apart in the salty and humid air.
Even though Havana, especially its oldest part, has been severely degraded, nowhere in the vicinity you can find as many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are being cleaned up, such as Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings urgently needed money, there was a green light for this development.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have emerged not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar pipe from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Exit targets
The most important places are not missed by most visitors to Cuba.
There is no need to write about Varadero or Havana.
It remains only to be mentioned that in the already mentioned property of Hemingway there is a museum, whose visit should not be missed by those who like this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities accumulated fertile soil, through which also weathered rocky areas are covered with dense growth.
This valley is where the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can encounter it when you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was shot there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Her fame and wealth came from slave trade and sugar.
Wealth was embodied in the ornate beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed in the last four hundred years.
Located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, Trinidad is such a remote place that there was no road to connect the area with the rest of the country until the 1950s.
This isolation helped to keep it unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was demolished, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon to visit Trinidad, it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the “Valley of the Sugar Factories”.
In the evening, you should then go to the Casa de la Música, which revives after the dark, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba is described by some as the most beautiful of the island.
Certainly this view will also be influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading there from Guantánamo must cross high and crumbling mountains and run through a landscape hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern suburb of Cuba was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List thanks to its unspoiled nature.
There the best chocolate is made, the church shows the Cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the trips of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, several table mountains can be seen, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves profess, about all this one could write many pages.
But, as they say, it is better to see with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say.
Too few troops and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO should draft a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going according to their expectations, this was agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, by the representatives of the countries that have units stationed in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating countries are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defence secretary Robert Gates, is urging NATO units to be more active, Britain considers the priority to strengthen the Afghan government’s authority and to intensify development aid.
“In Afghanistan, progress is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable residents to start developing their own economy and security," Defense Secretary Des Brown told the BBC.
90 percent
The activity of Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years, according to the US military.
The number of violent acts has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops stationed in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have come to an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can them," Gates said.
This was stated by NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop.
“I’m not happy with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that’s too little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been controversy among the countries involved as to whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For passivity, Germany was criticized.
The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British newspaper "Sun" described this week the German soldiers as lazy.
"Afghan non-Stuer uncovered: the Germans are playing games while our boys are fighting," the Sun wrote in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper went to counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit during a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt will rise to 1 trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a government debt of 84,000 Krona.
The total debt rose to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to owe 159.2 billion cousins this year.
However, in early December, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
The public debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its debt data for the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of 84,000 Krona.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"So far, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the one trillion crown limit until 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns,” said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, to iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, says: “We could reach a trillion over the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I do not assume such a change,” he noted.
Debt is growing
State debt comes from government debt and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
Government debt is financed by treasury orders, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds of the European Investment Bank.
This year, the national debt has risen to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state’s foreign debt has increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average debt maturity has risen to 6.5 years.
“Total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is going.
It is interesting that the growth is most notable in bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that something can be done even before the pension reform comes,” Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
According to the 2007 funding and debt management strategy, the government had planned to raise SEK 159.2 billion for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns, thanks to the better development of the state budget policy.
This amount is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
These include a maximum of 13.3 billion SEK for the consolidation agency, a 10-billion SEK reserve for pensions, 43 billion SEK for government bond financing and 1.8 billion SEK for bonds at the European Investment Bank.
Because she gave a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, accused in Sudan of insulting Islam, was sentenced by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion.
The British woman was accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to name a teddy bear Mohammed, despite any depiction of the Islamic prophet being prohibited.
She deserved to be spotted.
After parents of students complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at Unity High School in Khartoum, was arrested at her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this case begins in September, when the teacher asks her six to seven-year-olds to choose a name for the classmate.
“The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said school director Robert Boules.
Finally, as the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favourite first name.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all, it is also a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the image sign “My name is Mohammed.”
The bear itself wore no shield with this name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knows her well, and she would never have done anything that could bring her too close to a religious belief, “I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name,” according to him, this is just an “innocent mistake.”
A view shared by numerous students of the teacher who describe her as “very attentive to her students” and as “a person who never talks about religion in the classroom.”
Keep in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given second name in the UK, for which there are 14 different ways of writing in English.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of tribute to the prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can you give him a toy?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
At the last meeting in Vienna on Wednesday, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo concluded a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversies over the future status of the separatist province.
“It is regrettable that the parties could not come to an agreement on the status,” European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a news conference in Vienna.
Underlining that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart, Frank Wilsner, called on Belgrade and Pristina to meet their commitments to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
"There are no violent acts expected in the near future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time," he added, indicating that there are clear tensions.
End of negotiations on December 10
The mediators of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represented the sixth and last negotiating session since the troika received an order from the UN last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked the recognition of Kosovo’s independence by the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
“Russia has been and remains an advocate of a negotiated solution, a consensual solution,” said Botsane-Kharchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence.
After Kosovo was administered by the UN for eight years, Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to announce it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favor.
Belgrade calls for greater autonomy
“Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached,” the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these “last chance negotiations” have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that the plan for autonomy proposed by Belgrade “belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations.”
The domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, on his part, believed that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade says it is concerned about a “domino effect” in a region that has been weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible," he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision would be made solely and solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word.
"Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu replied to journalists that “the parliament of Kosovo will have the last word regarding the status” and added that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population will be “coordinated” with the Western countries.
Bush calls for agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which he led in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60 years-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must “destroy the terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two sides of their commitments to the “roadmap” for peace they agreed on in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately aim to reach a peace treaty that will clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This designation encompasses the three major issues around which the Israeli-Palestinian disputes mainly revolve: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees displaced from their homeland in the current state of Israel in the course of the 1948 conflict.
After the US president, Abbas took the word and insisted that the upcoming negotiations will be “comprehensively and thoroughly” and provide a settlement on all points, listing “among other things Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.”
When Olmert, for his part, took the floor, he pledged that the upcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted “directly and without interruption” and that he would endeavour that they could be completed before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his “vision of two states,” a Palestinian and an Israeli, which exist side by side, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it received assurances from Bush in this sense before it decided to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries offering Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view,” the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are confronted.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the initial results of the investigations of the National Disciplinary Surveillance of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
"He had no action, but was on track, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light," a police spokesman explained.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, “without license, therefore not released for public transportation” (see below), came, driven by two youths without a helmet, “at very high speed”.
“It hit the left side of the police car after disregarding its advance from the right,” a police officer continued.
Alcohol controls on passengers are very negative.
The condition of the car (broken wing, split windshield, broken shock bar) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the “facts of involuntary murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger”, in coordination with Val-d’Oise’s main public security department.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that her investigation of the IGPN at this stage excludes the responsibility of the police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, “confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small-powered wheel has reached their left side relatively quickly.”
Yesterday, a sort of rift, caused by friction of the footstops on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained hooked in until the policemen managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical examination.
The bodies of the two victims were obtained yesterday.
What happened afterwards?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round, as a result of which the policemen had left the scene very quickly, and this without providing the two young people with help.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also exclude “any serious mistake” in this matter.
According to a police source, “this is a difficult aspect of the investigation that requires further investigation and which needs to be taken very carefully.”
Libération encountered an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
“We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her,” said the witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a totally disturbed policeman hanging.
Two others tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth called the phone.
Given the tension that had quickly formed around the event and, it seems, due to the certainty that the persons present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still, according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived “about twenty minutes after the police departed.”
They also used heart massage, but in vain.
“I will not allow anyone to claim that the police did not help the youth.
First aid was provided to these children.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police defeated the first demonstrations since the state of emergency was declared two days earlier by General Musharraf.
According to witnesses, in the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken as part of the state of emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades used by the law enforcement forces there.
They then threw stones with which they wounded the police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios were seen in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court attorneys have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations following a wave of approximately 500 arrests of oppositionists, human rights defenders and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations were held in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-east).
On Monday, the lawyer movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president “called on the people to send flowers to the judges who have spoken out against the state of emergency, and to those who have sworn in to Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday night.
In the days that followed, he had to address the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on October 6.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
“All that we represent is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to surrender command over the army and become a civilian president “is no longer valid” since the emergency declaration, Vice Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to hand over his military uniform by November 15, the date on which his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a residence by his deputy army commander.
More than a third of pregnancies are unplanned.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, according to a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (INED).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of women between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless enabled better “fertility control.”
Eight out of ten births are carefully planned.
For one in five couples even calculated precisely on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season when it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repairs at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the International Space Station (ISS) crew will have spent more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a faulty solar collector, which is essential for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has set several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools "built" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem arose on Wednesday when the astronauts loaded the Harmony module from the Discovery spacecraft, a large cylinder-shaped part that is expected to soon accommodate European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module labs.
You must be able to supply them with electricity.
So the second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5-ton module for power generation via solar panels already on the ISS to bring it to its final position.
After moving it, the crew went on to restructure the solar collectors of the module, whose span length is 76 meters.
And then it happened that one of the collectors, which can stand out like accordions, was damaged by a stuck cable about a meter long.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to further damage the collector.
The astronauts, who originally left the Discovery spacecraft for a check-through and then were to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around the end of the 30 meter long remote-controlled arm of the spacecraft to which the station had been attached to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resilient, very skilled, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old learned doctor was chosen to “operate” the “injured” solar collector.
Having carefully examined the damage, he broke through the faulty cable and attached a kind of rail to the damaged spot.
He was supported by a second “Spacewalker” who stayed near the loop, and, from the inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, the crew’s commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey shooter wrapped in insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar collectors that generate several hundred volts, the astronauts on board the station had conceived and “bustled.”
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded before counting out his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery today, expected to return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the Aviation and Defense Group announced that it will have to spend between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion to counter the A400M remains, the EADS stock is currently showing a marked decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
Currently, EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to re-examine its business forecasts for 2007 with reference to the residues caused by the slow progressive development of the A400M engine, which delayed the aircraft's non-stop flight.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft amount to “between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus,” the European manufacturer’s parent group EADS said.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further details.
The group also states that the estimate of the new costs is related to the six-month downturn.
As a reminder, EADS’s business performance fell from 86% in 2006, largely due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the very large carrier A380.
The group originally planned to deliver the first A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
On Sunday, it will not be exciting when counting the polls: the mass of Russians will decide for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
After a very tight election campaign, she confirms her quest for stability, and even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is addressing a message broadcast on public broadcasters to the voters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, when the president received foreign ambassadors, he didn’t let go of anything and was content to deliver a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interfering – his favorite topic during the election campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and hope for fair elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud,” he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have failed.
It condemns an election campaign stained by repression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would have never been such dirty elections, not even in the days of Yeltsin.
Following the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for unlawful demonstrations, according to his lawyer continuing to ban visitors.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus.
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two far-reaching questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The Official Gazette announced yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to announce themselves.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third term in a row.
There is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
The Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and all-powerful party of United Russia, who will elect the government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the current power will triumph.
That is tradition.
“The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovietic, they are not masters of their fate,” said Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further: the bourgeois society has developed very slowly in this country, which was Christianized to Europe for five centuries; the famous spirit of community has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has rejoined the model of a paternalist state, which was fully accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was followed not by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “freely renounce the personal responsibility” which they briefly revealed after the collapse of the USSR.
Why think long?
This phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional heads) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
People prefer stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
The conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: “Why think long?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why do they replace?
A heavy memory
After being kept confidential for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, stored on a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, have so far been unable to be accessed unless with a “humanitarian” intention, i.e. individually and by name, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven countries in charge of its administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed in May 2006 to make it accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable investigations, “especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the health status of the forced workers,” explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, opposed making these name-related documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The concentration camps inmates lists or the Gestapo arrest warrants had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with proof of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen process tens of thousands of personal requests.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in accessing Bad Arolsen.
“You can expect nothing fundamentally new in these documents,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
The EU and India have signed a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, trade between India and Europe reaches 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s most important trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said the European Union and India hoped to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission green light last April to open negotiations with the aim of signing free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of India’s foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to figures from the European Commission, India is only the EU’s ninth trading partner.
“A free trade agreement will greatly advance the two economies” and “India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans,” confirmed Peter Mandelson.
The Asian and European giants exchange annually “goods worth 47 billion euros” and “services worth 10 billion euros,” Daniéle Smadja, chairman of the European Commission’s delegation in New Delhi, said this week and regretted that mutual trade “has not yet exhausted its potential.”

The Bank of England takes note of concern and offers £10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday expressed concern about curbing the currently recurring concern about loan terms, announcing a £10 billion offer at a base interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual duration.
To alleviate fears that financial market conditions will be harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about how they should organize their liquidity positions during this period, the bank intends to offer a significant portion of its savings during the conservation phase that begins on December 6, in the form of a five-week open market operation.
The bank further explains that in this way 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation on 6 December at 12:15 GMT, at the base tax rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE has put liquidity into circulation for five weeks in an open market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is "ready to take further measures to maintain the" day by day different "interest rates" of interbank loans with its basic interest rate.
The interbank interest rate varied from day to day at 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has climbed to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of the summer, the amounts put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalties that have prevented banks from using them.
According to some rumors, reinforced by the evolution of the pound against the euro, many preferred to sign for the amounts put into circulation by the European Central Bank at more favorable interest rates and with safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text.
The text, which arose in the framework of a socialist “niche” (session on the initiative of a parliamentary group), indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, most of which were 50% for employment allowance, for the reintroduction of the TIPP flotante, for a transport check or for the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against reviewing the articles (180 votes to 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to partially violent swings of words between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy’s television post on purchasing power.
PS Deputy Leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present all of their proposals as amendments to the Bill on Financial Correction, which had been reviewed by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“It’s an honor for our company to work with a person who has served as a role model for the current festival movement in America,” said Charlie Jones of C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival is likely to take place from August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Festival Republic director Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as a co-owner, has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the “most inspiring event” he’s ever attended, says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working side by side to offer the area a festival event in European style.
“We have selected Philadelphia as a market and are working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city center of Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations mt of the city and the commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we are stuck in political debates about the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately benefit the public."
C3 Presents brought the 2005 Lollapalooza festival to life in Grand Park Chicago after making its debut in the world of festivals in 2002 alongside the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events generated gross tax gains of $9.8 million and $11.8 million in 2007.
Both festivals take place in urban environments.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a rural festival, whereas ours is more likely to take place on urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
"The goal is to somehow merge these two concepts together to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival in the European and a urban in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is taking on the burden of this event with joy,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms "that they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the recording capacity of the festival is "very large" in approximately 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasty rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who won the top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator.
It’s not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no one less than the Terminator stands up to it.
These lock trials are part of the delegate tasks.
A politically “dirty mandate” because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has blamed “Runaway Productions.”
Is it difficult to negotiate with the governor?
“You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those we think are the best,” he says.
Running to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, at the moment, the introduction of the cinema there is a top priority.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be all about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them, and making sure the producers give interviews.
The Dark Age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be featured at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market on the verge of an end-of-year rally? disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks until the end of the year on the stock market, investors are already rubbing their hands in view of the upcoming end-of-year rally.
However, experts cannot make sure predictions in this regard.
Banif believes that “Statistically speaking, the month of December on the stock market is usually accompanied by positive market developments.
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only based on statistics.
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price rise in the last few weeks of the year, they still note that “the exchange price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants.
Consequently, according to these experts, the stock exchange will be more likely to have a more lateral, influenced by market fluctuations, price trend, “mostly because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the possible decline in the U.S. central bank’s interest rate, an uncertainty mainly due to the rising price of crude oil and the risk of rising inflation.”
Javier Barrio, Chairman of Sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its peak on November 8 from 15,945,7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully close the year with 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional subsidy of the pension fund, which is made every year at that time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could develop a little differently, mainly due to the end-of-year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and therefore immediately after the bridge day to the Day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are on a near-technical level, which could lead to “that there could soon be a deviation from the index values, the extent of which will depend on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
Analysts say they are positive.
When it comes to choosing the values to push the Ibex to new highs, analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney says that this year is the turn of the big values.
Among the value winners, the expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies, “because the electricity sector will be too expensive at the time.”
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be accompanied by the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, real estate companies will benefit from it.
“ACS has been on a boost in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” the expert said.
Regarding the increased consumer behavior during Christmas days, periodic consumption will determine the market events in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also positive sales results, even if they are only represented in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December showed only two falling rates.
When the technology bubble placed at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and initiated the last real end-of-year rally so far.
This year, when the Ibex 35 rose by 28.17 percentage points, December recorded a price increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and can also show a end-of-year rally will be seen.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economic regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular represents the first banking group dares to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekends to 20.30h and on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in its branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The bank’s ongoing negotiations with the unions seem to aim at an agreement by which 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturdays and open on a weekday afternoon, though not for the customer.
Whether more banks will join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening hours, will depend on the Popular Bank’s experience.
And this is also the intention that Popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches that, due to their location, can capture the bulky customer base of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large shops.
The bank intends to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as there are no new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, while aligning them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of opening hours is combined with a new space design of the stores, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colourful design.
Responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require major investments, but would be accompanied by an increase in employment, since a branch would now need no more than six, but eight or nine employees.
Branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine stores in Madrid.
And the experience values were positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets of Bravo Murillo, O’Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages approximately 2500 branches.
And another 60, operating under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
The BBVA model will not be used in these PopularMax stores, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
“We do not want to be a competitor for our customers,” Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have reached a provisional agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external banking personnel.
Spanish private channel Telecinco for the first time doubles its stock market value, surpassing its rival Antena 3.
We have succeeded.
With this sentence, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange.
But one aspect dampened his joy: “That’s exactly what hurt me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had smaller losses,” he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too deep.
Telecinco ended the day with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain reduces its previous loss this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company’s value now reaches €4.488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento holding only 13%.
Rivale Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has a total loss of 40,5% since January, making its market value of 2.193.46 million half.
The market value of other listed communications companies, on the other hand, increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million, in the case of Prisa (editor of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2.518,53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be inferred from the fact that it is “two similar companies,” Vasile said.
The question remains uncertain to what extent we can actually operate on the stock market, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
Telecinco announced a week ago its plan to grow to be the first television station this year with more than 1,000 million gross advertising profits. This was assured by Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million of the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net revenue increased by 1.6% in the first nine stock market months (up to 734.4 million), while net revenue from the television business was only able to show an increase of 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco’s comparatively better stock market performance is the high payout ratio the company has seen so far: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría resulted in a 100% dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as the parent company, could still vary, although it is still too early for an official announcement.
“We are obliged by the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated much more so far.
I hope we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stock values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market currently shows some losing trends.
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco for this year by 4% and for 2009 by 7%.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% and from 5.5% in 2009 to 5.1%.
This also lowered Antena 3’s expected profit for 2008 by 4.5 percent and for 2009 by 7.5 percent.

Congress approves the MIFID directive, which came into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary preparation, which today concluded its session with the Senate resolution on the amendments to the draft, the government published the provisions arising from the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
Representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of congressmen and senators who, in their negotiations and votes, had pursued the goal of establishing the best possible regulation that guarantees the security of investors and regulates individual entrepreneurial activities, thereby guaranteeing a general efficiency of the market.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, the MIFID, which redefines the Regulation on Investment Services, aims to improve investor protection, increase the scrutiny of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive will enable financial advice to specialised firms as well as to natural or legal persons and will also contribute to the establishment of new financial services firms (ESIS), the consulting firms that merge with investment and securities brokerage firms.
Furthermore, it expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, adding to the regulated circulating markets the multilateral systems for the trading of securities and the systems for the internationalization of trading orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment firms to disclose the priorities of their business profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks in the market and to register all operations carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Congressional Economic Commission subsequently envisaged further changes, with the decision that titled bonds now have to be considered “complex” financial assets because of their high risk level for the investor confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis.
Furthermore, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the fields of work of graduated economists was taken advantage of, 30 years after 1977, when the regulation, which limited the fields of work reserved for economists, was adopted.
The Senate, in turn, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic intermediary working on foreign account, which does not require authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and for the acquisition of customers simultaneously to several investment companies.
The Harmonised Consumer Price Index (VPI) increased by five-tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which, by publishing the data, seek a location and quality comparison with U.S. products.
The forecast for the indicator can be made early by applying the same method as for the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modeling methods to estimate the information that was not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the early determination indicator serves only as a benchmark and therefore does not have to coincide with the final result, which will be announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (CIP) will remain at a relatively high level.
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the VPI in November is a “temporary development”; at the same time, he assured that the price index will continue to remain at a “relatively high” level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the Congress building that “even if the current figure is not good,” Spain’s inflation difference to the other members of the monetary union has remained “more or less the same” in recent years.
He also explained that there were “less surprises” in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
“We expected a value of around 4%,” the Minister of Economy and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock to generate revenue of more than €42 billion over the next three years
Northern Rock’s holdings have dropped by more than half after the bank requested an emergency loan from the British Central Bank in mid-September last year, and are now only £12,000 million ($16.800 million).
At that time, the bank’s assets amounted to record 25,000 million pounds, a sum that has dropped significantly within two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence and even despite the government’s 100% guarantee that the money is safe, will continue to decline until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would continue to run the group under the brand name Virgin Money after the acquisition, will have to raise approximately a quarter of the revenues of the British banks that will consist there from investments over the next three years in order to acquire exactly the 18 billion pounds still needed to reach its 30 billion target.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for his striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend £50,000 million (approximately €70 million) annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to its goal.
This week, Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, which includes three more companies, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of bankruptcy.
Totana Mayor Arrested on Suspicion of Participation in Urban Construction Corruption
Spanish police arrested this morning the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) in the municipality of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partido Popular and at the time chairman of the municipal council of Totana, last May, and could be the original drawer of the plot, according to information from Cadena SER.
Officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused by Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption case discovered earlier this week.
According to Cadena SER information, the lawyer of the “popular” and consequently privileged MP Juan Morales was arrested while leaving his client’s residence on the basis of important burdensome documents allegedly related to the plot.
Additionally, other sources report Morales' alleged payments to a Galician construction company, which included the conclusion of a city-building contract, in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in detention.
Bono agrees to accept the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and, in case of election victory, in Congress.
Former Defence Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will lead the list of PSOE candidates at the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in case of a election victory of the Socialists, take over the office of Congress President.
This was announced by José Blanco, the organizing secretary of the PSOE, and Bono in a press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party’s headquarters.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified, since in politics it is “important to be able to count on the best” and Bono “is among the best.”
Furthermore, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, the Mancha-born politician would “apparently” run for the party as chairman of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as president of Congress, who announced on November 15 that he would no longer participate in the next general election, end his career in public policy and instead engage in the university field for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that the prime minister had continuously pushed for his return to political events since he resigned two years ago.
Furthermore, he pointed out that the party, as with the appointment of the Vice-President for Economics, does not want to deny citizens who would take over the post of Congress President in the event of a election victory, describing this as an “act of transparency.”
If he actually takes office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a “house of respect and not of insult or scream” in order to make it appear more and more similar to citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, one gets the impression that the only place where one cannot speak quietly and quietly in Madrid is the Congress; so the Prime Minister in the Senate has been interrupted once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised current President Manuel Martín and “his good work” and indicated that he did not want to make it seem that he had already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call this “arrogance”.
Climate propaganda
As the climate debate is subject to ruthless criticism from both climate change skeptics and those who put a social and political debate at the forefront, the movement as a whole must demonstrate strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a “new treaty with the planet”.
This proposal, however, puts him in need of explanations regarding the action or non-action of his government, which has contributed decisively to the fact that Spain is at the forefront of the EU among the countries that have least met the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for the failure to meet the requirements, to which sectors this is due, and why his government, which had proposed the “Contract with the Planet,” has not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to show the Spanish citizens the measures he intends to tackle climate change without hesitation.
Which companies will be affected, what behavior of citizens needs to be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures need to be implemented and what economic consequences will result.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice and will pay for saving the planet.
However, there has been and will be no such explanation in the future.
It is about sacrifice and payment.
Because the measures that can actually be used against climate change are unpopular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gas cents proposed by the PSOE, Zapatero seemed so dangerous from an election strategy point of view that he was forced to withdraw the proposal again.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, that is, with pure propaganda and empty proverbs without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, commissions, minutes and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politician otherwise suitable for election campaigns must neither speak nor accuse nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding expense of decorating the meetings and enthusiasming others with his gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not imply that the bike will become the only means of movement in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with a box.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to alleged involvement in urban construction corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, which belongs to Murcia, the “popular” politician José Martínez Andreo.In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor’s office and a hotel entrepreneur have been detained on suspicion of urban violations, investigative circles said today.
The city council was arrested at his place of residence, from where he was brought to the municipal office and in whose premises he remains to this day, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the city administration and at the municipal construction management “Suelo Industrial y Vivienda”.
The three arrests are related to the searches already held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where it turned out that more than 2 million hectares of unused construction land were to be redesigned for urban projects under the leadership of the Galician construction company “Nuaria”.
In addition, two other people have not been arrested directly, but have undergone an investigation initiated and conducted by the First Court of Totonas.
The first six detainees were presented to the judge.
According to investigative circles, the case is also being investigated against the former mayor of Totana and the current independent PP MP Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who resides in Murcia, are suspected.
The chairman and owner of the “Nuaria” group, the Vigo-born lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the town of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of “Suelo de Inmonuar” Pablo José M.G., whose company operated as a subsidiary of “Nuaria” and allegedly received the funds.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority for Urban Crimes, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives conducted eleven additional searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farming business, who is alleged to have acted as an intermediary.
The construction group “Nuaria” was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the village of Murcia, which would include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometers of land in Totana, which was to be reconstructed, with the aim of implementing a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and that of Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, which specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the forefront of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18, coincidentally on that day, whose issue contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the subject philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a high school student who in his news quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, Pekka Elo, chairman of the Educational Council for Philosophy, urged teachers to take a more critical stance towards Plato and proposed to remove Plato’s teaching from the sub-level curricula for Philosophy in high schools.
Three
A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Penal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a breach of law, punishable by six months in prison.
However, if you robbed a music store for less than 400 euros, this is considered to be a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the store up to a value of €1,000, the theft will be considered a crime, but the penalty will be lower than for a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than it is to participate in a music exchange.
Participating in a rebel conflict entails a sentence of imprisonment of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while data exchange entails a sentence of imprisonment of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorization has not taken place, is subject to a heavier penalty than the distribution of pornographic film materials to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague is right, then someone has drawn up his demands quite well.

My family doctor handed me one of his long, strange research articles titled, “Money leads to activation of certain brain regions, especially when others get more of it.”
So the feelings arising from the monthly salary are dependent on the salary of colleagues.
The study was created using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the findings were published in the latest issue of the scientific journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research center Life & Brain, “activation was strongest when the participant gave the correct answers and his associate failed.”
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants answered correctly and therefore received the same amount; but if one of them received twice the amount, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I’m not quite sure if it really takes so much scientific effort to reach such a conclusion.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been unremittingly searching for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years and is headquartered at the Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and a laughing eye as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - namely former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic remain free.
Their names are listed by the Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary “La Liste de Carla” (2006, not yet released in Spain); a film that follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in the rhythm of a political thriller in her plan to track down the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to tighten their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
The car insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which, in turn, depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of drawing up the driver’s license, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
It is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right car model.
First, we need to be clear about what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement is recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged in return to provide the corresponding amount of compensation in the event of a damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance, which consists of several factors, including age, gender, time of drawing up the driver’s license, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
The insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that in case of a higher risk of accidents, higher contributions will also be due.
This is why both people over 25 and women have to make fewer contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower rate of accidents thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, as they, according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the company’s conviction, tend to have fewer accidents than single persons.
The benefit attributed to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting out the premium, insurance companies must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly in order to choose exactly the car insurance that most likely meets his personal needs.
We now list the most important points to consider when choosing an insurance in order to be able to make a choice not only in terms of performance but also in terms of price.
Those under the age of 25 encounter numerous obstacles when choosing an affordable insurance, such as the low driving practice and the “young” driver’s license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to make a full cascade insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full casco with self-contribution, so that while the benefits of a full casco insurance are covered, they are offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay a part of the amount caused by the damage himself.
“The amount will be determined prior to the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid,” explains Luis Noguera, Spain’s chief representative at First Europe, an online insurance broker.
Another option is the extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage incurred on the own car.
Additionally, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here is a advice.
If you’re under 25, it’s up to you to reduce insurance costs; so your credit will increase by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the base rate at the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment implies an increase in said tariffs.
The amount of credits and fines depends on the company and its revenues.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can afford to increase the bonus payments,” Noguera explains.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract.The reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
Therefore, it is most reasonable to opt for a full-cash insurance with self-participation.
“Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving,” explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice, after the “fear of the beginner” has been removed.
Nevertheless, for a married client who does not have children, it is more advisable to make a full-cash insurance; of course only if the financial situation of the person permits.
On the insurer’s side, couples with children are considered the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly their contributions are also low.
In this case, a full cash insurance with self-contribution (at an amount around 300 euros) would be the best option.In the event that you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which only applies to the third year of the vehicle.
“They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make higher contributions,” notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is advisable to enter into a full cash insurance with self-investment (at an amount of around 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which only applies with a sufficiently high credit.
Ultimately, one must note that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accidental damage, but also because it carries high costs that require a thorough choice that fits our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes to reach the point for the semifinal in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight next Tuesday in San Siro for the point they lack in order to reach their respective goals before the Champions League round is over.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another one to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not overtake the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place a week before the end of the sixth round as FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where it will fight for the first time in the semi-finals on the 13th to enter the final, which will take place on the 16th.
Thus, this group will be completed before everyone else and the draw at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium will be the expected outcome, even if both teams will try to win.The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Keltik Glasgow knows that in case of a victory they would be group first and thus have a better starting position in the semifinals.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even have a defeat in a match with FC Shakhtar to qualify. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because with nine points of equality the Ukrainians are entitled to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but could win in the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Milanese will try to spoil the Scots in the evening. They again hope to reach the eight-finals of the changed Champions League for the second time in a row, after being defeated in the main game season in exactly the same round by a goal of Kaka in the post-match (1-0) and by a zero-to-zero draw in the final.
While FC Shakhtar awaits the victory of the “Rossoneri”, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both the achievement of the eight-finals and its membership in the UEFA will depend on his victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Benfica Lisbon could, despite its lower ranking position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, win the third place and thus play with UEFA.
20,000 people attended the first Spice Girls tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls launched their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, before the eyes of 20,000 spectators since the band’s dissolution in 2000.
‘Posh Spice’ (Victoria Beckham), ‘Scary Spice’ (Melanie Brown), ‘Baby Spice’ (Emma Bunton), ‘Sporty Spice’ (Melanie Chisholm) and ‘Ginger Spice’ (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before the start of their concert at the GM Stadium Place de Vancouver that the mood in the reunited band was ‘outstanding’.
Around 20,000 people attended the concert at the sold-out stadium, showing a video about the band’s history, which caused furor in the late 1990s.
The reunion and world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo", which will be released in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls were wearing gold bracelets on stage, which were previously presented to them by the spouse of "Posh Spice", English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowds of fans in the audience that made the GM Palace glow, even though the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
While preparing for the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British star “hasn’t seen our closet a single time, so I’m curious what he will think of the show.”
Sporty Spice, whose withdrawal from the group in 1998 "due to internal disagreements" two years later resulted in the group's dissolution, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press conference.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the global public had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And so I thought why not; so I’m happy to have made this decision,” Chisholm commented on the band’s breakup nine years ago.
The singer also said that “the disputes have been eliminated and now everyone is very happy.”
However, many things have changed since the last Spice Girls concert in 1998.
First, the group arrived in a special plane of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver, according to CTV.
Upon her arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of midwives.
The five have seven children together.
Following the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will enter the stage in Madrid on December 23.
New concerns over gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is swelling between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk that Russian fuel exports to Western Europe will be impaired.
The majority of Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is monitored very closely.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow takes place at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine must be charged more because the group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the main gas transit states in talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] through Ukraine.”
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This resulted in a drop in exports to Western Europe, which drove prices drastically up.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s gas supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own gas supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS “must control foreign workers”
The Scottish State Health Service needs to improve criminal record checks for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation from Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought to Scotland in connection with the June Glasgow airport attack.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish state health service has no precise insight into the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important checks on a sample of five health authorities were carried out correctly.
The Chief Financial Controller investigated staff recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a ground car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bombing in Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service will conduct checks prior to hiring foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the agency does not have the authority to obtain this information outside of the UK.
The report of the Chief Auditor now states, among other recommendations, that the Board should take guidance from the criminal record extract, which helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Al we found evidence of these checks in some staff records, they were not routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their survey guidelines before hiring highly, but added: “Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information about the number of foreign healthcare workers is available.”
BMA Scotland chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in advance of hiring potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
“The report says that NHS Scotland’s current performance tests are working well and it’s not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver,” he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the boards would have trouble identifying those employees who are on indefinite leave.
The investigation also found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were mostly complied with.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines on pre-employment checks for foreign staff at the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a concern for me to do this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow airport."
She added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines on control surveys prior to hiring by all employees – including those from abroad – which is scheduled to be published next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the film biography about late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has earned five awards at the British Independent Film Festivals, including for Best Film.
Awards were also awarded to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being casted for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and secondary actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded Best Actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing the British film to the world audience.
The prizes were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis’ rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film – whose soundtracks include The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – was filmed for just £3 million.
Nevertheless, he has won two awards to Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known so far for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, as best director and best directorial debut.
Rock music was the focus of another prize winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for Best Documentary.
The award for best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-playing thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who stands in the reputation of playing hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
“There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me,” he said.
“I’ve been lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He’s my kind of person, a great actor of his time, I’m really honored.”
The Independent Film Awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that planned an imminent attack on an oil plant, as well as clergy and security forces.
The world’s largest oil exporter’s state television said one of the cells planned to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on a oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid intervention force to protect facilities after a failed al-Qaida attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an interior ministry statement, says that 18 of the arrested belonged to a cell run by a “missile expert” who immigrated illegally into the country.
He that the militants planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees, according to the report, planned to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clerics to do more to stop Saudis striving to Iraq to join forces with al-Qaeda militias seeking to fight the Allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hardliners among Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias see many clerics in Saudi Arabia as cooperating with the authorities in supporting the royal family’s policies that dominate the government.
The militias – accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader to target the pro-Western Saudi government – have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This has been a very great effort by the security forces over the past... five months," a spokesman for the interior ministry told state television.
The arrests also affected a 16-year-old “media cell” from Medina aimed at promoting the “takfiri thinking” – the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims supporting violence against Muslims branded as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
Climate on Venus Could Give a View on Earth's Future
Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit shows that the planet is even more like a twin of the Earth than previously thought.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are roughly the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, conditions on Venus would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But due to the unstoppable carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere due to sunlight and a slower rotation rate, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings from the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which has studied the plants for a year, offer a disturbing glimpse of how the Earth could evolve in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express mission, said: “It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of Earth, while the planets are otherwise pretty similar.”
“Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus started like Earth billions of years ago, possibly with a habitable environment.”
Enriched uranium seized by police
One kilogram of radioactive material,ly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people had been arrested and that the material was being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Everything is open
Mitt Romey said he does not think it is worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican presidential candidate ultimately declared willing to engage in a debate on YouTube where ordinary voters record questions on video and submit to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the Snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected precisely the state of the Republican Party, which breaks up in the next year’s elections.
It’s not known, just like the producers of CNN who supported the debate with who selected YouTube clips to show the prospective candidate.
However, in the first half-hour of the debate, the longest dedicated to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
This is one of the most pressing issues for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to serve a ballot when they heard things they liked: The television station noticed peaks of approval as candidates spoke strictly across borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation that he was compassionate about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two settled apart fiercely as questioners asked if one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Less important candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, managed to follow up on this issue.
Neither of the two men has serious chances at the nomination, but both remain in the race, because they have hit the immigration spell earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates largely share the same views: tighter borders, intolerance toward illegal migrants.
This topic, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between Liberals and Christian Conservatives.
But the debate became clearly problematic as other topics were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he has supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the respondents asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now at the top of all expectations in a recent Iowa poll thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism — said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When he was pressured whether Jesus would support them, he laughed at them and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political post.
The race remains extremely open.
Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul’s recent donation successes and his applause storms in Wednesday’s debate.
These two have been shot up from nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the outset and convincingly with a victorious message about the greatness of America and a twinkle to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
The pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not slippery.
No nobility titles appear to have been sold, no Parisian hotel bills paid to any politician, no out-of-marriage toes licked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has covered up donations to the British ruling Labour Party of more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the names of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without which the competing Gordon Brown would have done well.
When, two months ago, the prime minister withdrew from demanding an election, stupidly insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that polls would not have influenced that decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp-minded leader of the Liberal Democrats, expressed, the once feared Brown has evolved from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The ruthless rescue of Northern Rock, a beaten bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thought out proposals to change tax laws have brought corporate associations against the government.
The tax administration’s loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative plunder.
A trio of retired generals launched an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: being minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abraham; Peter Watt, Labour’s secretary general (and its former execution chief) has already resigned.
Nothing of this means that Brown irrevocably breaks down towards resignation.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they find it impossible to govern.
People neither like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he doesn’t even need to be there for a long time, this postponement is over: the public service begins to get dull; the cabinet ministers start chatting; the press is looking for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and pointless.
In a way, Brown’s position is difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he can’t claim to be a new beast.
As much as he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction documents, for example, are linked together with decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes — like in the long “money for nobility” investigation into political party financing — voters might assume he was.
However, Brown’s situation is not as bad as it seems.
The misconduct is not as terrible as the conservatives describe it.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died, or has been completely shattered.
And the remedy, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid, and slightly brutal government.
The new gathering of political donations is a good example.
The garboesque of Abraham, who compares his gifts to his charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
It may be, but the decision was not for him.
The laws against anonymity for big political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who says he knew of Abraham’s deal, but not that it was illegal, will of course have to ask a few questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s chief fundraiser, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he was aware of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered that determination by gripping to a well-known instrument, an investigative committee on the subject - led to make the measure full, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "learnings to be drawn from" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it is a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent committee on standards in public life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and moving forward with a comprehensive reform of political party financing.
This would require Labour’s hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly give up their special financial relationship with the unions – bitter pills for a party mate like Mr. Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can a victory is through undeniable righteousness and solid competence.
card shark
Does the credit crisis hit America’s credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that the spinal cords spin around excitedly.
Now that America’s real estate market is shaking, the predators are targeting the country’s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of contagion from underfunded loans spread to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the outbound rates and the mortgage rates, which measure the percentage of loans that are not withdrawable or are more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it has removed a $1.4 billion fee collection from its U.S. consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card users.
However, it is too early to panic.
Losses and losses are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody's, the third-quarter drop rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in U.S. private insolvency laws in 2005 resulted in a sudden case of bankruptcy reports, which in turn accounted for a large portion of the credit card losses; the number of applications (and thus mortgage fees) would rise again whether or not the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate.
The industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month.
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stall in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, expects that spending volumes for 2007 will eventually be 25% higher than last year.
There are direct channels of infection between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: consumers are more likely to take on credit card debt now that home loans are drying out.
However, card issuers look at cash flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower’s creditworthiness.
They can even be advantageous for card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates decrease when the property is less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react to the more stormy conditions much faster and more flexibly than lenders by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid revaluation of assets.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and completely reassess the loans,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial adviser.
Even if a sudden coverage crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are much more real.
When lower home prices and a decrease in credit push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a harsher future.
Keep looking for these shark flies.
British banks confess guilt in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their role in the fraudulent system with former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow turned their petitions guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally claimed innocence for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications resources for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty for a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during extradition proceedings that took two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
The charges originally filed against her in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the target of a government investigation related to Enron’s downturn.
The charges against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claim that they came to Houston in 2000 to unleash a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron machinery that helped tear the company into bankruptcy.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under Koppers’ control acquired the bank’s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Copper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow misrepresented Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper, and others lost about $12.3 million, according to the prosecution.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two charges of conspiracy for his role in Enron's bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison sentence in the federal prison of Louisiana.
Copper is sentenced to three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was freed on the basis of a $1 million deposit that required them to live in the United States pending trial.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh largest company, collapsed in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions of dollars in debt or make weakening appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
Lays convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were void after he died of heart disease last year.
Not down in Moscow.
The price of a Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that’s small money for some of the wealthy Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But none of you ask for so many seats because it’s for a private family or a corporate president.”
Firer was at the Gulf Stream stand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgia of displayed consumption hosted in a chained exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had built exhibition stands, hoping to attract newly-financed Russians to everything from mahogany-folded yachts to diamond-coated cargrills that would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a glossy orange Porsche at the nearest exhibition stand.
“That’s a nice car, but it’s small money compared to us,” he said.
After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.
Driven by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas in its glorious times.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went into crowds to Europe, where they were considered materialist,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world’s most visible freelance issuer.
The most exclusive luxury brands are seeking their share in the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week a conference of the luxury industry attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who have a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert panel here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the subsistence minimum.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweller.
She had attended the trade fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
“The women are all exemplary and the men are all worth a fortune.”
As they walk through the halls Sunday night in evening clothes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, describe themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've been looking for the cars and I'm trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The exhibition seemed to be aimed primarily at the newcomers, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in traffic jams for several hours to visit a side-by-side warehouse that blatantly put Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, tailor-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai, and Gund Teddy bears side by side.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of the Dutch porcelain maker Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climbers."
In fact, traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years is old by Russian standards) have already moved from large-size logos to the kind of sober brand with limited numbers that would not market themselves at a trading show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, messengers of millionaires or just tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, told a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company sold the gritty orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer requirements, said he had sold three car cooling grids for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, the same chain bracelet tires, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spikes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a fourth replacement.
“The Russian millionaire who wants to have straw leather wheels or a picture of his wife’s face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily drive on those wheels,” said Mr. Karapetian.
“He’ll keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage.”
Although many of his Russian customers are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local property prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company had set up four British-style red cell phones that were filled with mountains of fake million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passengers stopped to throw around the pile of money, cell phone photos while lingering down in the middle of replacement wealth, being cut off by friends, or simply stealing a few million.
“You see, in Moscow anyone can feel like a millionaire,” Mr. Karryev said.
Surgeon suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the large glass window of Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched an ambulance stop at the white Cape Cod two doors further down West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another.
"Then I saw the doctor's bodyguard's boxcar approach," Livingston, a supervisor at the restaurant, said on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone was dead."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant of the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure carried out by an unauthorized, cosmetic surgeon not identified by the police, who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo’s death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, the results of which may not be available for weeks, will help unravel a mysterious death that has sent mourning to the head of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and stubborn," Mr. McCarthy said about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
“She was my pitbull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepmother.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
“That’s one of the possibilities,” Ms. Walsh said.
“It is an ongoing investigation.”
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, who is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not say whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro’s house, where a dotted rose bush stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian bats behind the house.
A blue barrel labelled “Ethyl Vanillin” – used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes – sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hanged from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him find himself in the provincial and tough political culture of his new city.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this or that,’” he said.
“She was always here when I arrived here and she was always here when I went.
It was embarrassing.”
Expectations that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to rising global stock markets
Shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm credit markets through further interest rate cuts were reinforced by reassuring comments from the U.S. central bank’s vice president.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number two of Ben Bernanke, the head of the central bank, said the policy needs to respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure frightening markets in the face of signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turmoil had “partially reversed some of the improvements in market features from the late part of September and October.”
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further tightening financial conditions for consumers and, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into the U.S. markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The statements also helped calm Wall Street, facing further bad news from the U.S. economy, now that U.S. real estate sales reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were highlighted by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global employees, in a cost-reduction measure to offset severe losses from its lost bets in the U.S. mortgage sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13.289.40, while the wider S&P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of UK standard values.
Germany’s Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
Earlier, the resurgence of credit pressure on markets had been highlighted after strong demand at an auction of three-month guarantees from the European Central Bank granted to European commercial banks was granted to considerable 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow up and infuse more capital into London’s money markets increased as credit tensions saw the three-month “Libor” rates for loans between UK banks rise to 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, after a continuous rise since November 21.
England faces decision on statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of which is almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, is here on call at least under this special title to decide to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan, and because the table of High Morries, the English chief executive officer, is gradually filling up with applications for national electoral offices, if not even for part-time ones.
Anyone who doesn’t get the sixth pitch will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport is undoubtedly.
It’s never easy to pinpoint exactly what enables a person to reach the top of their profession, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of luck rather than skill.
It’s not just in cricket where the choice is difficult, where judgments are needed that are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it?
The same may also be asked in another area, whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good grades who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can tell what the right class is for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or fall.
Of course, numbers have a big influence on decisions, but chances have that too.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain’s eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a striker has to get regular odds on order if he wants to impress as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the voters is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, as James Anderson, who apparently will play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and as the wind kegs into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their glosses and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at the Asgiriya stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice may determine both men’s careers, or it may make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, still struggling to consolidate at the time, who made the breakthrough into a significant test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, after further discussion during today’s online session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and feelings for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 top-notch hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is 22 years seven years younger, and an excellent balance against rotated bullets.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a Middlesex player, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection by the voters as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his beat that was still obvious in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-knowner of Essex has a glimpse of joy in life.
He is impressed with nothing on a cricket pitch, and his attitude away from it was pointed out when he recently struck over a four-wheel drive vehicle at an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was pick up his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from a distance, and say with enthusiasm, “Did you see this?”
Bopara is a much better field player, he coughs his middle pace with some effect here on the fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Per this is the true art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn’t mean that Shah may not be doing well if, as the Ceylon Tea Set suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work - and to Fight Al-Qaeda
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas are running out, and others hoping the city will return to normality.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At Mansour Bus Station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan returning in private transportation.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to resume at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local US-backed militia helped drive al-Qaeda out of their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been expelled from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a hand grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to fight Al Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and those of my boys.
That’s why I’m back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many told that they had been lured by the growing calm in the capital since the U.S. troop rise and the growth of local “groups of affected citizens” armed and working with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But more spoke of being forced back home due to visa problems and stealthy funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed common suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
“We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government pressured the Iraqis to stop giving them visas to force them to return to Iraq,” said the Sunni retiree.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left.”
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were expelled from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have diminished.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will revive sectarian tensions and cause conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
In one area of education alone, the Saarland has the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I declared yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Insular country that we are not French" - this slogan is selfishly posed by the smallest federal state on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which ranks fifth in the education monitor of the Institute of German Economy Cologne (IW).
The universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighboring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
The proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
However, the Saarland also brings rural children to universities in an above-average number - many of them without a high school degree.
“In Saarland, you use the vocational education system,” says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their qualification to study at a vocational school, so Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination possibilities of professional and academic training are also comparatively expanded.
In terms of population, the facilities with dual degree programs are the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has dropped by a third in recent years.
This is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
“In the general schools, we initiated a number of reforms after the first Pisa study,” said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
The government has introduced national comparison tests.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of Kita is free of charge - a model that other federal states now also copy.
Whether the performance of students continues to improve will only be shown by future comparative studies.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of risk students fell from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not grow as strongly as other federal states.
The Bavarians are better.
And to the loss of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area you could otherwise score.
Because the language of the neighbors is obligatory in high schools – even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chavez is changing the clocks.
In Venezuela, the clocks will be different than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez reversed the time in the South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez has become a joke figure.
As by the official newspaper of Venezuela, according to a new law, the clocks will be set to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, who is hostile to the United States, motivated his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States had imposed the world’s division into full-time time zones.
On Wednesday, Chávez announced the cessation of relations with neighboring Colombia due to a hostage affair.
The leftist nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will have no relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this on my own because of my dignity," Chávez said, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country will have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The dispute was triggered by Uribes’ decision to withdraw Chávez’s mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages.
Uribe spit Venezuela in the face with his decision, Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
In Spain, Chávez is also in full swing.
A new phone ringtone is causing furor in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why you don't shut your mouth) is the phrase that has already been downloaded by more than half a million people from the Internet.
He was addressed by Spain’s King Juan Carlos, who at the recent Iberoamerica summit was upset by the constant interruptions of the left-wing populist and had gone over his mouth.
Germany threatens lower wages in 2007
Despite the strong economic conditions, German workers are forecast to lose real wages this year.
Experts named a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could actually expect less on the salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The blame for this is the modest growth in wages, the increase in VAT and the price hikes in food and energy," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told the Bild newspaper.
New burdens could also be imposed on workers with unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should not be embarrassed again to have to ask the Bund for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products has pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Prices increased by 3.0% overall compared to the previous year.
Venus is Earth's Infernal Twin
Despite its life-threatening atmosphere, Venus is more similar to the Earth than previously thought: the European spacecraft "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and winds at the poles, as they also occur on Earth in the winter.
For three decades, scientists have suspected that it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided the proof - it sensed electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: the flashes on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous “original soup theory”, lightning caused life on Earth: storms are said to have triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
"If there ever was life there, it must have been in very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the devil's twin on Earth, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, has undergone such a completely different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The launch of the Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus exploration since the early 1990s, with no spacecraft being deployed to explore the planet.
The latest research findings, now presented in several "Nature" articles, emphasize, according to the researchers, not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighboring planet with Earth are greater than initially thought," the ESA said.
In addition to the already known north pole wind, the researchers also found a cloud-strudel on the southern pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon resembles air flows in the Earth’s winter hemisphere, writes a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second deepest planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also referred to as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in just 225 days.
But it rotates much slower around itself: a Venus day takes 243 Earth days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly resembles Earth, scientists assume that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, which remained in the oceans on Earth, but on which Venus was lost into space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor’s office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and has called on the large coalition to end the dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights are universal for me, even though I respect the diversity of cultures,” said Köhler.
Everyone should know that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but took Merkel in defense from the accusation that she is pursuing a new China policy.
“The German Chancellor has not given up on the traditional one-China policy.
China knows this too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed dissatisfaction with the reception of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the EU’s “shadow window policy” in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor's office, there was fierce irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only discharged German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the foreign ministries of both countries, according to SPIEGEL information.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now urged Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
China rejects if European politicians receive the Tibetan religious leader in official functions, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the further Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots in France
Street battles with police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not unfold in violence on the streets, the German Interior Minister said.
Barricades burned, gangsters fired on police: after the severe youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development.
“We must take care that social explosives do not build up and discharge into violence.
We have to take this seriously,” he told the “New Press” in Hannover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change of social reality.
Federal, state and municipalities have already worked hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
“From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, this already shows first successes.”
However, it is too early for warning.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs like in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, youths had engaged in heavy street battles with police in recent nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
Greater integration efforts by the federal government, however, was called for by the chairman of the Turkish Municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In the face of the riots in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as bad as in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migration background under 25 years of age is "over-average high".
First of all, more training places should be provided.
Kolat stressed: “We need to give young people a perspective.”
The head of the Turkish municipality added, however, that in Germany more than in France "a social control takes place in the families".
Many young people with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warned, “But we have to be careful.”
We need to give young people the opportunity to participate quickly in work and education.
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were deployed, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The authorities three arrests as well as a few burning garbage cans and cars.
Since the day before, an emergency of approximately 1,000 security forces has provided calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
Around 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night the riots hit Toulouse.
The riots erupted in a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the children.
The Kingdom of Angela Wolke
The chancellor’s unreal appearance documents that the coalition is at its end in terms of content – and that there is nothing to expect from her.
In which country does the German Chancellor live?
After her consolationless appearance in the Bundestag general debate, which was rude and low in content, one must say: not here - not in the country that should finally be ruled by her.
The accusation that she is focusing too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with a fiercely arrogant phrase.
That’s provincial, she said, showing that she doesn’t want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the Bundestag, she has clearly documented to everyone how true her accusation is.
There was no concrete interest or feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: an outspoken politician who fled to foreign policy and still remains nearby.
Example climate protection: There she praises the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate targets should be achieved here.
Overall, the self-pronouncement - so much inhumility the CDU leader would have failed two years ago.
Now she is clinging to the flock so that the recovery comes to the people.
This damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of judging the world.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of the low-income?
There are a few sides left for her.
It is indicative of how often she promises herself when it comes to the child’s supplement.
Three steps are needed for Merkel to make a half-right sentence.
It stumbles like on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attack
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney give each other a tough blow – and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The candidate’s tensions are relieved already on the first topic.
He has made New York a “refuge for illegal immigrants,” Mitt Romney accuses his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
“I would say his own home was a port for illegal people,” Giuliani responded, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to attack: Since the Republican base still has no clear favourite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-titled 30-second videos submitted by Internet users via YouTube are little more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism we have brought Hitler to power," McCain accuses his counterpart Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round demanding an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets the Levites read vigorously by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", a questioning method in which drowning is simulated, as torture.
But that the campaign’s key topics are now beyond the Iraq war and torture debates, the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected, applause burns in the auditorium.
This shows again where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains, scratching and pleading to the base and television audience that he was still among the advocates of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes into trouble when he is asked what he thinks about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf governs for the first time
One day after his resignation as chief of the army, Pakistani leader Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This ended eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcasted the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as chief of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thus bending to international pressure, from the United States.
Eight years after taking power in a military coup, the former general is now ruling for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, soon after his oath, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency and thus fulfill another demand from the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which had occupied Musharraf after the imposition of the state of emergency in early November with his weighted lawyers, had last week rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded in an attack on a military convoy.
According to a military spokesman, the bomb exploded on a street near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock Returns
Germany's super group of the Seventy is musicing again: the three members of the band of Harmonia took their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
To the revival appears a recording from her great time "Live 1974".
At that time, they were much more famous abroad.
The anticipated sensation then occurs in the form of three laying gentlemen at the dinner table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables, and most importantly their buttons.
Dieter Moebius is in a white shirt at the age of 63.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and in possession of a laptop and guitar.
Right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves, concentrating on the console.
Everyone makes a noise, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the men themselves.
The band's return to music Harmonia has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
What one can reveal here: Targeted inquiries revealed that the name whispered through the collective pop memory, but in no way so sustainable that this band has been painfully missing for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the Germans also be allowed to celebrate their living legends from the 1970s?
Especially because what is misleadingly called Krautrock was always worth more in England and America than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for life-work to the survivors of the Cologne group Can in 2003, questioning German pop faces were seen in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked each other in the Laudatio with the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! the amazement knew no limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother later performed on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and enlightenment in a foreign country is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with Harmonia because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also developed a much lower power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first, they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record labelined by the church.
Rother had worked at Kraftwerk for a short time and then gained a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, the then most radical German group.
By 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musician into exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as city-fugitive communards.
Less ideological than in the Commune I, where Roedelius was allowed to plague himself as a babysitter.
Rather in an artistic style.
It is said that in the garbage there was also a wimpel of the singing society Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for art.
Some things kept Harmony firm.
The first album was titled "Musik von Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because as quiet and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The travel collection was not only for self-discovery.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" was co-cut at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record scene of almost 50 people, as someone thinks to remember.
From Rother came the desire to force Harmony and occasionally practice.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band announced their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric Spheric and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company, Greenland, has set the goal of nurturing the Krautrock as its own German contribution to live music.
New! was already excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, old punk and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
Which would outline the entire range of the influences of Krautrock on subsequent pop music.
From Harmonia, the empty space of the supergroup is filled.
Brian Eno’s phrase floats with the most extraordinary sounds in the hall: “The only true music, you belong to the future.”
There are pictures showing the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse.
Legend formation is served by projections of further black-and-white photos of wirr-cable devices.
The three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No more, by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drummer to attract unheard sounds to the instruments via self-built effect devices.
Electronic music is like electronic music.
Three in technical depths.
This doesn’t change the house’s structure either.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgensterns, it is hosted and wiped under sound clouds and sung in a beautiful place with the emphasis "Aaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music colleges (Can), technologies (electric power plant) or on the escape from artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Whoever cries '68' here is not completely wrong, and Harmony cannot be removed from it even now.
Even the most obvious thing is thoroughly reflected on the stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can steal your nerves or give you moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
"The Hunting Party" and "Murderous Peace" are two films that deal with the Balkan War.
Both are not convincing.
Either the concepts put too much on action and gestures or they are too touching.
Richard Gere in The Hunting Party.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, it is precisely there, in the dark background of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties because too many pleasant roles in women’s well-being films and too many press conferences on Buddhism took a look at one’s lust.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the hunter becomes the hunted" (Why film titles today must always be as long and confusing as locomotive tariff contracts?)
Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has long left his best times behind, but who even as a ruinous monument of his decline has still preserved considerable remnants of his former charm.
But despite this trumpet, "The Hunting Party," along with the German production "Murderous Peace", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serbian from Kosovo snipers, and one of them soon falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not depicted here as the only root of all evil, the television film too quickly loses itself in gesture and action.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with war for that.
On the other hand, “The Hunting Party” is an example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters opening up to track down the Serbian war criminal “the fox” might have become a new “Apocalypse Now” at another time with a different director and scriptwriter (both in staff union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are strikingly similar: Both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military can not, and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of “The Hunting Party” is that you don’t just let Simon Hunt be the down-down cynic with heart as he’s introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also tell him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
Finally, “The Hunting Party” then goes down the stream when reporters in the last five minutes of the time-trapping process succeed what NATO, the CIA and all the money hunters in the world have failed in five years: catch the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to just revenge.
This is so bad that one wants to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against kinology.
The film has a profound human concern.
He wants to accuse that Karadzic and Mladic are still running free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they should exceptionally agree) of not engaging in the persecution because of secret political arrangements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar that one comes to mind with a famous Brecht poem.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet’s desk: “I compassionately see the swollen foreheads, suggesting: how exhausting it is to be evil.”
Movies like “The Hunting Party” have exactly those twists, but that suggests how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, it has been in this newspaper that all Iraq films were Hollywood’s big flops.
One can add: there has never been a good South African film.
Almost always, when a star runs around the world’s crisis hubs or minefields, something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arquette, “Beyond All Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Blood Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Per all the conflicts are just too close in time.
It had to be decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with “Schindler’s List.”
Some films will probably still mature - the Vietnamese works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett", now considered classics, have not been celebrated unanimously as masterpieces at the time.
But we know today where every mass murder in real time comes home on two screens, even just too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that deprives the scriptwriters of the carelessness it takes to tell good stories.
"Being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Per you have to have the sarcastically distant artistic view of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel “Lemprières Dictionary” and the Balkan War, he replied: “That’s just because some things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in terrible ways and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust criticizes Olympic rejection
The mayor’s withdrawal from Hamburg’s application for the Summer Olympics has encountered fierce criticism from politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But von Beust urges realism in the assessment of opportunities.
The chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described the resignation as "not good for the business location".
No other project has unleashed so much motivation in the city in recent times as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the sporting momentum could not beined to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, “based on a changed timeline.”
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions are unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation expected for early December on a Munich application for the Winter Games 2018.
“This preference means for us that we will not have any realistic chances in the previously planned period until 2028.”
Nevertheless, the dream has not been dreamed out forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer be applying for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to seize a chance by buriing the plans already at this point," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also in conflict with the statement of the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception to the General Assembly of the German Higher Education Association.
There, von Beust described Hamburg’s application for the 2015 Universiade “not as a substitute” for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Higher Education Association had only last week nominated Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD citizenship group accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
“The development of the Little Grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put it on the Olympia map and clamped out the housing sector,” said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for the Little Grasbrook an integrated planning for the Olympics and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU has unilaterally put on the “event factor”.
The nomination for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg at the time caused a lot of enthusiasm.
Hamburg failed to Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes.
Those who combine the terms Sweden and the wooden box think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden throw dark shadows on Warhol’s work directory.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo boxes listed there are counterfeit.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol’s 1968 Brillo boxes a few months ago, internal investigations at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now come to a disturbing conclusion: The six Brillo boxes that former museum director Pontus Hultén donated to the Moderna Museet in 1995 are copies – and probably also most of the about one hundred other Brillo boxes of the “type Stockholm” in circulation on the international art market.
The prehistory is chained, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard of the soap powder "Brillo".
A 1968 exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet exhibited – with Warhol’s consent – hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these were (for cost reasons) not from Warhol, but were supplied directly from the Brillo cartonage factory.
They were not works of art, but models, merely exhibition pieces.
At the same time, in 1968, Warhol granted permission to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which at the time entered the history of art and auction as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the designation "Typ Stockholm".
Some of them have earned more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that about a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at the Moderna Museet, has also examined three of the six museum-owned Brillo boxes, two of which were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their press panels were first grounded and melted, after which white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the press panel with a roll of paint without grounding - in addition, it is not an oil, but acrylic paint.
“These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol’s Brillo boxes,” said Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet, “unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York comes to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition materials.”
In July, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the “severe accusations” raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, it has remained in implacable silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered in a hotel in Manila demanding the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot blame bloodshed, leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel.
Government-reliant soldiers had previously stormed the hotel using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been stuck in the building for hours.
About half of them were tried on Thursday for a failed 2003 coup attempt - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the negotiation to suddenly settle out with about 30 supporters.
The military policemen, who were actually supposed to guard him, had apparently run over to him and joined his riot.
They invaded the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops blocked the district around the outstanding hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillanes said.
“We are calling on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Government critics have called for large protests against the president for Friday.
Their government has been overwhelmed by corruption accusations for months.
The financial district of Manila was the main scene of the attempted riot of about 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
